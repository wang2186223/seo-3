                <p>Katrina urged, &#34;Seize half of Bennett Group&#39;s assets, Divorce Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Momentarily, Joyce&#39;s expression tightened as she hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being tough is sometimes necessary for a woman to get what she deserves. If you hesitate now, Alexander might start hiding his assets. You could end up with nothing. Imagine him using what should have been yours to charm Daniela. Could you live with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s hands balled into fists. She could not. Her discontent, however, was more profound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had once been fond of her, so what had caused him to stop noticing her all of a sudden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had run into the fire to rescue her instead of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These actions had convinced her of Alexander&#39;s genuine affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when had his attentiveness weakened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had Alexander started to disregard her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it her assertiveness that repelled him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No man appreciated being forced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fists still clenched, Joyce inhaled deeply and looked towards where Alexander had gone. &#34;Mom, I want to try again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina opened her mouth to respond, but Joyce cut her off. &#34;I&#39;ve decided. Don&#39;t try to change my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed, resigned. &#34;Very well, but one day you&#39;ll see. When a man really cares, he&#39;ll go to any length for you, even risking his life. That&#39;s true love. But when he doesn&#39;t like you, he won&#39;t even spare you a single glance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce understood this. Yet, the dissatisfaction within her lingered. In the courtyard, Daniela noticed two figures drawing near. She thought it was Lillian and Ryan. A bright smile spread across her face. Her smile momentarily overwhelmed the approaching men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s beauty was renowned, yet her smile was rarely witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as she realized who they were, her smile disappeared, replaced by a polite expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose, nodded at the two, and began to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Harper,&#34; one of them called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning with a puzzled look, Daniela responded,&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t know each other, but we&#39;re familiar with your reputation. Rumors say you&#39;re unapproachable, but seeing how you&#39;ve socialized today, you seem quite friendly. We were hoping we might become friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a subtle smile. &#34;The rumors hold some truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men appeared puzzled. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do tend to keep my distance,&#34; Daniela explained. &#34;While friendship might be too much, perhaps we could consider a business partnership. Please excuse me; I must attend to other matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these words, Daniela left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men exhaled deeply in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even without Cedric, approaching Daniela seemed an impossible task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander arrived in the courtyard to find it empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His dreams of helping her didn&#39;t happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the silence, his quickened pulse now seemed out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric was at the piano, his fingers dancing across the keys, while Daniela stood by, her smile subtle yet captivating. Entering the hall, Lillian caught Daniela&#39;s attentive gaze and followed it to Cedric. &#34;Daniela, hasn&#39;t Cedric been a bit too showy lately?&#34; Lillian asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning confusion,Daniela responded,&#34;Has he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Daniela&#39;s amused expression, Lillian asked further, &#34;You know he has. The last time Cedric played the piano was when you came back from abroad. At a function after his big deal, he declined to play.Yet today, here he is, performing with such flair. Doesn&#39;t that strike you as strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to discern Lillian&#39;s point, Daniela sighed. &#34;What are you suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, Liflian said, &#34;It&#39;s obvious you&#39;re together. That&#39;s why Cedric&#39;s been so joyful. Despite the rumors about his preferences, he looks content. He must have got what he wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled.&#34;Really now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Lillian said, her tone serious. &#34;And you&#39;ve been unusually cheerful yourself. Don&#39;t hide it from me,Daniela. I promise I&#39;ll keep it to myself this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused to take a drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes pleaded for the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Cedric stepped down from the stage, approaching Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the ambient lighting, they appeared as the perfect duo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Ryan, Daniela suggested with a smile,&#34;Why don&#39;t you explain to her?&#34; Then she turned to Cedric.&#34;Shall we go home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood there, completely stunned. She turned to Ryan, bewildered. &#34;Did Daniela just suggest they go home together? What does that mean about their relationship?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric stepped outside together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a few more steps, they suddenly heard Lillian&#39;s shout, loud and uncontrollable.</p>
