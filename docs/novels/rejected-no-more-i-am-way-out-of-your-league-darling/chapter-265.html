                <p>Joyce was now Alexander&#39;s wife, and her every action now reflected on the reputation of the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected violent episode had cost Alexander several important business deals as he made his way to the police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands clenched the steering wheel with increasing force, his frustration mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once believed that once things calmed down, he could finally find the right moment to express his feelings to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce had destroyed any chance of that now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of anger bubbled within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the situation demanded his attention:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce remained his wife, and her actions meant the Bennett family was left to shoulder the fallout of her scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander headed to the police station and arranged for her bail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, clutching his chest, turned to Alexander and said, &#34;Take Joyce to her parents&#39;. I don&#39;t want to see her around for a while!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving him a chance to reply, Richard headed straight for the driver&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the door closed, he cast one last glance at his son, his voice firm and unyielding. &#34;Divorce Joyce! She&#39;s nothing but trouble, and the longer she stays, the worse it gets for the Bennett family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Alexander took it upon himself to drive Joyce and Katrina back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the ride, Joyce wailed and voiced her grievances nonstop. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with Richard? It&#39;s the middle of the night, and he&#39;s kicking me out, sending me back to my parents&#39;. I&#39;m the victim here.Instead of blaming those people, he&#39;s blaming me. Alexander, say something! Your wife was wronged, and you just sit there siently. You&#39;re such a coward!°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the back seat, Katrina noticed how tightly Alexander&#39;s lips were pressed together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened as a flicker of worry passed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that sllence like his only came from deep disappointment, the kind that left no room for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle tone, Katrina sald to Joyce, &#34;Enough now. You&#39;re at fault too. Alexander came to pick you up; isn&#39;t that enough? And hitting someone-what were you thinking? That&#39;s more than anyone would expect, and it&#39;s definitely not okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina glanced at Alexander, offering a placating smile. &#34;Alexander, I&#39;m sorry. Joyce has been spoiled by me, and it&#39;s made her temper worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot back instantly, &#34;Mom, what are you even saying? Those people were spouting nonsense! They&#39;re insane! That banquet was awful anyway, as if I cared to be there. I&#39;m a shareholder in a prestigious robotics company now. Even if it&#39;s just a small share, my monthly earnings are enough to make them jealous.Why would I bother with them? And if they talk trash again, I&#39;ll put them in their place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed internally as a dull headache began to form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, she couldn&#39;t help but think that Daniela gifting Joyce shares in the robotics company had been a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had only inflated Joyce&#39;s already overbearing ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with some financial backing, Joyce seemed to dismiss everyone around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed quiet, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, Joyce told Alexander, &#34;It&#39;s late, so why don&#39;t you just stay here tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Joyce&#39;s remark, Alexander looked at Katrina with calm politeness. &#34;Katrina, I need to have a private word with Joyce.&#34; Katrina immediately grasped what he intended to discuss, and the reafization made Joyce&#39;s heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina let out a weary sigh and sald, &#34;Alright, you two have your conversation. I&#39;ll head to the kitchen and whip something up. It&#39;s been a long day, and you must be starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and left, leaving them to sort things out on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lingered, pressing her lips into a sly smile as she raised a brow, mimicking how Katrina always seduced Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning toward Alexander,she murmured,&#34;Alex-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could finish, he pulled her away forcefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce.&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice pierced through the stillness of the night, cold and sharp like a blade.&#34;|t′Stime we end this. Let&#39;s get a divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she had braced herself for this moment, hearing the words out loud sent a jolt of panic racing through her. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean exactly what I said. Let&#39;s end this. There&#39;s no point in dragging it on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury bubbled inside Joyce. She was ready to snap but held herself back, her voice barely a whisper. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? It&#39;s clear as day. You&#39;ve been part of the Bennett family for months, yet not a single one likes you.The house staff doesn&#39;t respect you, and the employees think you&#39;re useless. Joyce, can&#39;t you see?Everyone looks down on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce balled her fists, scrambling for a reason. &#34;It&#39;s because you&#39;re indifferent to me! The way you treat me sets the tone for everyone else. If you showed me some real affection, they&#39;d follow suit. They&#39;re all just a bunch of yes-men, only reacting to what you do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander could feel a headache brewing, his frustration growing by the second.′′|sthat your view of them?Let me remind you, on our wedding day, when you were drunk, it was the staff who took care of you.My father made you soup in the morning, and my uncles gave you gifts. Have you ever stopped to wonder why they don&#39;t like you now? It&#39;s because you think you&#39;re better than everyone now that you&#39;ve got some cash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sulked. &#34;If they had the skills, they&#39;d make as much as I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt like he was speaking to a brick wall.&#34;I&#39;ve said all I need to say. We can part ways peacefully,or we&#39;ll go to the court. It&#39;s up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Alexander turned and walked away, not willing to stay in the same room a second longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, Katrina appeared and saw Joyce standing alone, her face a mess of tears and snot.</p>
