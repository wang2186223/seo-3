                <p>Bennett Group, known for its formidable strength and prowess, stood second only to Cedric&#39;s enterprise.Alexander harbored no doubts-this project was meant for him, his ticket to a triumphant future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The inner turmoil faded away, leaving behind nothing but cold, unyielding resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the shimmering lights, Daniela&#39;s beauty captivated him anew. Alexander pondered that once he secured the project and its lucrative rewards,it was time to talk to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had given him a second chance before, and she&#39;d probably do it again-she was practically obsessed with him, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the stage, Daniela&#39;s gaze swept over the crowd,landing briefly on Alexander, whose ambition seemed almost tangible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile played on her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, maintaining her poise as she resumed her address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander approached Lillian to collect his copy of the bidding documents, he met with a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t Daniela&#39;s potential financial loss that bothered Lillian; rather, she found Alexander&#39;s brazen opportunism distasteful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had to tug sharply to liberate the documents from Lillian&#39;s firm grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bidding was set for the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each competing firm would fill in its bid, and the project would be awarded to the lowest adequate offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had meticulously prepared their cost estimates,aware that this was their sole opportunity to submit their bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At lunchtime, Elite Lux hosted a lavish buffet free of charge, yet none of the executives had the appetite to partake. Their minds were elsewhere, deeply engaged with their finance teams, laboring over the precise figures to submit on their bid forms later that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt a surge of confidence in his company&#39;s calculations. After quickly finishing his meal, he made his way upstairs to meet with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as he approached the elevator, a security guard stepped in his path, blocking the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see Daniela,&#34; Alexander insisted firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard remained unmoved, his expression apologetic yet resolute. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but Ms. Harper is currently on her lunch break and is not accepting any visitors. Additionally, to maintain fairness, she is not meeting with representatives from any bidding companies during this period. Are you by chance involved in the bids this afternoon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Alexander was involved in the bidding, he would be denied any contact with Daniela. Alexander was well aware of the rules, but his dire situation left him with only one option-go to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just about him. This was for his family, for the livelihood of thousands of employees, and to live up to Richard&#39;s expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hoped Daniela would understand his position,allowing him to proceed to the afternoon&#39;s bid without any lingering doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I need to speak with Daniela for a moment.It&#39;s a personal matter, unrelated to today&#39;s bidding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not available to meet,&#34; the guard stated firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander made a move to bypass him,the guard didn&#39;t hesitate to summon reinforcement. &#34;Lillian,could you please come down here? There&#39;s someone named Mr. Bennett here, and he won&#39;t take no for an answer-he wants to see Ms. Harper now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s irritation was palpable the moment she got the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s delay, she descended the stairs to confront Alexander. Her voice was icy as she addressed him. &#34;What&#39;s so important that it can&#39;t wait? Why must your concerns always disrupt our peace? Can&#39;t you see everyone else deserves a lunch break? Do you really think you&#39;re so significant that the world must pause at your whim? It&#39;s frankly embarrassing, Alexander.Aren&#39;t you supposed to be more mature than this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the sharp sting of her words, Alexander remained steady and composed. &#34;Lillian, I realize you have your grievances with me, but this is urgent and only involves Daniela. I assure you, it has nothing to do with the bidding. May I please speak with her upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a sincerity that seemed more profound than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Lillian perceived him merely as a man blinded by the lure of profit. Elevating her voice deliberately, she challenged him. &#34;If this has nothing to do with the bid, why are you so hell-bent on meeting her right now?&#34; Her words boomed across the cafeteria, capturing the attention of the other executives who were awaiting the afternoon&#39;s bidding session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, intent on creating a spectacle, pressed on.&#34;And what&#39;s more, how can we be sure you&#39;re not planning to lean on your past relationship to influence or bribe my boss once you&#39;re behind closed doors? Are you looking for an unfair advantage-a shortcut, perhaps? That hardly seems just to the rest of us, diligently preparing our proposals. Alexander, choose the honorable route and abandon these shortcuts! Everyone else deserves a fair chance at this project, too. Why should Elite Lux favor you exclusively? What makes you so exceptional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her provocation, several business owners rose,their gestures accusatory as they pointed at Alexander. &#34;That&#39;s right. We all agreed-no meetings with Ms. Harper before the official session. It maintains fairness. How could you disregard the rules?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed. You already have an advantage knowing Ms. Harper. Why isn&#39;t that good enough for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s progress together in this industry. Allowing one entity to dominate isn&#39;t just. Let&#39;s uphold equity and collective advancement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re suggesting this isn&#39;t about the bid,but we all know there&#39;s more to it. You might be scheming something sinister. The Bennett family has a reputation for playing dirty to secure a contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fortune on the line, tensions were sky-high.No one was willing to back down or risk being outbid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minor concession for goodwill was manageable,but on a billion-dollar deal? No one was eager to absorb such a hit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices escalated, clashing in the room, their pointed accusations giving Alexander no chance to defend himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeated, he withdrew to his seat, his expression one of sheer frustration. He worried Daniela might misread his intentions. Since their divorce, his place in her life had felt increasingly shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he was resolute in seeking a moment alone with her. He needed to unload the burdens weighing heavily on his heart.</p>
