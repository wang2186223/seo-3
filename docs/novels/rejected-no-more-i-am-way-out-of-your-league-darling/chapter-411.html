                <p>Cedric shrugged off his coat and pulled Daniela into his embrace. The memory of their argument before he had collapsed lingered in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noticed the unease flickering in Daniela&#39;s eyes. Normally calm and self-assured, he felt a rare moment of awkwardness and chuckled. &#34;It was just a disagreement. That doesn&#39;t mean the love between us has vanished. You&#39;re my everything, and I can&#39;t risk staying upset with you. What if you decide you&#39;ve had enough of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, her gaze drifting to his arms wrapped so firmly around her. &#34;I&#39;d never leave you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile deepened, knowing the depth of her love. &#34;You should keep me on edge a bit. Spoil me too much, and I might start slacking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone grew firm, her eyes steady. &#34;That will never happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gazed at her delicate features, his eyes lighting up before he broke into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill in the air brushed against himn, but Cedric felt nothing but warmth in his chest. Smiling, he leaned closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up at him, her eyes expectant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice took on a playful charm. &#34;I just feel like flirting with my gorgeous wife on such a fine day,Mrs.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Josie was rinsing vegetables when she glanced up to see Cedric whisking Daniela up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, lounging nearby, spared them a brief glance before returning her focus to her game. &#34;No need to make dinner for those two, Josie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s look said it all. It seemed Daniela would be busy for the rest of the night, leaving little room for anything else. Josie chuckled, casting a knowing glance up the stairs. &#34;It seems they&#39;re going to have a baby soon.I&#39;ll be happy to help with a little one when the time comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped into the bedroom, Cedric gently placed Daniela onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s warm kisses danced down her neck, making Daniela&#39;s breath catch as she asked, &#34;Why call me Mrs.Harper, not Mrs. Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric slowly unbuttoned her shirt, his voice softened to a low murmur, pulling Daniela closer. &#34;|want to share your surname. That&#39;s how it feels right to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night stretched on, seemingly without end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a spacious cosmetic surgery center, Joyce stood in front of Alexander. She gestured towards his jawline. &#34;Doesn&#39;t something seem off? I remember Cedric&#39;s jawline-it was so perfectly smooth, like a work of art.&#34; The doctor smiled politely. &#34;Artificial work can&#39;t quite replicate natural perfection, but this is already very close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Joyce tossed a check from her purse. &#34;Is this enough? I want the face in this photo,nothing less!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor examined the check and let out a sycophantic laugh. &#34;Yes, yes, that&#39;s more than enough. But the jawline is crucial for facial expressions. To change it, we&#39;d need to redo the whole procedure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Essentially, every feature they had previously reconstructed would need to be dismantled and redone, causing the patient to endure the excruciating pain once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce remained unfazed. &#34;All I care about is looking exactly like the person in the photo. Nothing else matters to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce narrowed her eyes as she watched the medical staff push Alexander back into the operating room. This was his fifth major procedure, with thirty smaller ones still to come before anyone could assess the final results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the operating room, an assistant turned to the doctor. &#34;This kind of extensive reconstruction increases the risk of facial collapse later. The effect will only last around six months. Shouldn&#39;t we warn the patient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor picked up a scalpel, making an incision along Alexander&#39;s face. &#34;Do you think anyone who comes here isn&#39;t prepared for the risks? They&#39;re willing to risk everything for what they want. Our job is to give them a fleeting perfection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once their faces collapsed, those patients would return to pay for repairs, feeding the industry&#39;s growth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cosmetic surgery was an endless journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew this truth. But once people driven by greed and vanity began down this road, they couldn&#39;t turn back.</p>
