                <p>Cedric was nearly done with his packing when Daniela&#39;s voice echoed. &#34;Cedric, step outside for a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He halted, tension creasing his brow. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a word with you. Step outside for a sec, will you?&#34; Daniela responded, her tone insistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the first instance Cedric was hesitant to comply when Daniela summoned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced around, his unease apparent. &#34;I&#39;m sort of tied up right now. What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lingered in the doorway,her eyes steady and piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shifted awkwardly, his gaze darting, betraying his anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t pinpoint, a wave of remorse washed over Daniela. Cedric was blameless, yet his manner suggested guilt, as if burdened by some unsaid wrongdoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched him fumble with his belongings, clearly reluctant to join her outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, she pressed her lips, a sign of her growing frustration and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised his eyes to meet hers, his gaze heavy with unspoken pleas. &#34;I don&#39;t mean to be a bother.I&#39;m merely following along. Is that unacceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unvoiced thoughts hung between them, a silent accord seemingly reached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exhaled sharply, her lips a tight line, before she turned away, leaving without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, puzzled, sought clarity, from Joyce,who lingered nearby. &#34;Has she consented then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, well-versed in Daniela&#39;s complexities,pondered. Daniela, who had coldly left her own father in a psychiatric facility, might appear heartless. To her, Cedric&#39;s humble request was unlikely to make a dent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the hopeful glimmer in Cedric&#39;s eyes tugged at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had shown her its share of cruelty and deception; comprehending the depths of human nature was as elusive as grasping the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Cedric&#39;s heart lay open and honest in his dealings with Daniela, a stark contrast to the murky waters of human intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s life had become entwined with Daniela&#39;s,mirroring the way the moon orbits the Earth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as Daniela prepared to leave, she had no plans to bring Cedric along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left Joyce pondering-if Daniela truly departed, Cedric&#39;s world might become as bleak as a night sky devoid of stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at Cedric, offering a tentative nod.&#34;Perhaps she&#39;ll change her mind. You never know; you might just be the exception.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression was riddled with doubt. He pursed his lips, his voice soft and uncertain as he posed the question to either Joyce or himself. &#34;Could I possibly be her exception this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, after finishing work, Kohen sought out Daniela, visibly upset. &#34;Why not choose me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze with a serene calm. &#34;You lack the necessary acumen. How can I rely on someone who cannot even formulate a decent proposal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s gaze wavered. &#34;I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cut him off, her voice steady and clear.&#34;You&#39;re burdened by family responsibilities; you had children early. Your thoughts are more scattered than most. I need a partner who is neither naive nor preoccupied. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was always blunt, and her mood today was far from bright. She had no patience for softening her statements. &#34;So, you&#39;re blatantly aligning yourself with Charles?&#34;Kohen demanded, irritation coloring his tone as he found Daniela&#39;s confidence overbearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Daniela responded with a serene composure. &#34;I have the credentials. Show me you can match the elite-the world&#39;s wealthiest-and perhaps then you&#39;ll earn the right to bargain with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen clenched his jaw, his pride wounded. Each of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words hit home, infuriating yet undeniable.&#34;You...I...Anything Charles can offer, I can match it!&#34;A soft laugh escaped Daniela. &#34;Really?I&#39;m skeptical.&#34;Kohen narrowed his eyes, dlefiance flickering within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I say I can, then believe me, I can!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging his resolve with a nod, Daniela casually reached into a drawer, pulled out a fruit knife, and flung it onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife dropped with a loud clang, its weight unmistakable.Just then, the door to the CEO&#39;s office burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Charles strode in from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, not even bothering to glance up, addressed Kohen. &#34;You claimed you could handle it? Here-take the knife. Go ahead and kill Nikolas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that, Kohen and Nikolas both froze,stunned by her bluntness, while Charles looked on,utterly indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen, taken aback by Daniela&#39;s audacity, stared first at the knife, then at Daniela, and finally at Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, he turned back to Daniela, incredulity in his voice. &#34;You want me to kill my own brother?Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze with a cold detachment. &#34;Lost my mind? The person responsible for my mother&#39;s death holds more power than Nikolas. If you&#39;re too timid to confront Nikolas, how can you possibly be of any use to me? What basis do we have for collaboration?&#34; She continued, addressing both Kohen and Charles,&#34;Remember, we are partners here-equals. I don&#39;t play the roles of superior or subordinate. If you&#39;re not prepared to reciprocate on equal terms, then don&#39;t expect me to align with you.&#34;</p>
