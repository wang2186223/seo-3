                <p>The movers nodded and bent down, working together to lift the massive fish tank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the doorbell rang again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a piercing look, Joyce directed her fiery gaze at the housekeeper, her voice thick with exasperation.&#34;Have you lost your hearing? Open the door, now!&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears brimming in her eyes, the housekeeper went towards the door. &#34;Just how many more people do they intend to bring in?&#34; she muttered to herself,frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina reclined against Caiden, her fingers teasingly caressing his chest in slow, deliberate circles.&#34;Daniela&#39;s servant is just too careless. Next time, let me bring in someone more dependable to take care of her. It&#39;s the least we can do to ensure she doesn&#39;t have to deal with such incompetence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Caiden&#39;s expression melted into one of tender affection. He gazed down at her, his admiration palpable, and tenderly pressed a kiss to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina,your heart is just so expansive. You&#39;ve woven  yourself into the fabric of this family, yet Daniela hasn&#39;t once called you &#39;Mom.&#39; Still, you think only of her welfare. Truly, making you my wife was the finest decision of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze fluttered downwards, a rosy blush coloring her cheeks. &#34;I&#39;m simply reflecting the goodness you shower upon me,honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, observing her demure smile, felt a surge of warmth flood his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, brimming with a silent, electric charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the tableau that greeted Cedric as he arrived.The house buzzed with activity, movers weaving through rooms, while the housekeeper,her cheek puffed and reddened, tear stains marking her eyes,stood at the threshold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She edged closer to Cedric, her voice quivering.&#34;They&#39;re clearing out the house. Miss Harper is still sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s piercing gaze grew stormy, his features setting into a stern mask. Silently, he stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first spectacle to catch his eye was Caiden and Katrina, entwined in an intimate embrace,seemingly unaware of the world around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t even their house-it belonged to Daniela.Yet there they were, shamelessly engaging in flirtatious banter amidst the bustling movers. Had he not arrived when he did, one could only speculate on the extent of their indiscretions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyebrows knitted together, a spark of annoyance flashing across his countenance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Joyce spotted Cedric, her expression erupted in sheer joy. Overcome with excitement,she blurted out, &#34;Mr.Phillips!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric Phillips!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone like her, who seldom encountered individuals of Cedric&#39;s renowned status, the reality of meeting him was nothing short of mesmerizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rooted to the spot, she could do nothing but stare at him,her eyes wide with admiration as time seemed to slow down around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s absolutely stunning,&#34; she muttered to herself in awe, the thought echoing loudly in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His appearance was striking-those sharp features,those piercing eyes, flawless in every conceivable way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her overt awe didn&#39;t escape Katrina&#39;s notice. Standing a few feet away, she observed her daughter&#39;s lack of  subtlety with a frown. With a pointed cough, she attempted to snap Joyce out of her reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted back to the present, Joyce quickly dabboed at her lips and ran her fingers through her hair to compose herself. She approached Cedric with a tentative step, offering a hand and a bashful smile.&#34;Hi there, I&#39;m Joyce, Daniela&#39;s sister. It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained motionless, his hands tucked into his pockets, radiating a chilling aloofness. He gave Joyce a quick, indifferent look, treating her as if she were merely an inconsequential blur in his field of vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of embarrassment washed over Joyce at his dismissive gaze, yet her fascination only grew stronger. Despite his cold dismissal, her enthusiasm for him remained undiminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was discreetly studying Cedric from across the room. Though their paths had never crossed before,the tales she had heard painted a vivid picture of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood out dramatically-his height imposing,his features strikingly handsome, and his demeanor radiated an undeniable power that seemed to silently command respect from everyone around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Joyce could marry Cedric...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned her attention to Caiden, lightly  squeezing his hand to garner his focus. &#34;Between Cedric and Alexander, whom do you favor more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden grasped the essence of Katrina&#39;s inquiry immediately-she was appraising Cedric as a potential match for Joyce. He replied, &#34;Cedric, without any doubt. Alexander might have Richard&#39;s support, but that&#39;s precisely his weak point-Richard&#39;s influence is too pervasive, and Alexander can&#39;t seem to step out from under his shadow. Cedric is a different story He&#39;s self-taught, self-made. His achievements are solely his own, which even I must commend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, considering the familial implications. &#34;Plus,his personal life is uncomplicated-only his elderly grandmother requires his care. If Joyce marries him,she&#39;d practically run the show,with no one to second -guess her decisions. His prowess in business is unmatched, a stark contrast to the Bennett family,who are constantly currying favor and clinching deals.There&#39;s absolutely no contest-Cedric is in a class by himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes shimmered with excitement and anticipation. &#34;Do you, someone of your insight,truly respect him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded affirmatively, his face breaking into a thoughtful smile. &#34;In business, certainly. But should Joyce succeed in intertwining their fates through marriage, no matter his capabilities, Cedric will have to defer to me, regardless.&#34;</p>
