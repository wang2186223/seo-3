                <p>Brad waved off Hamilton&#39;s worries. &#34;Come on,Hamilton, you&#39;re reading too much into it. Josh has always looked out for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, &#34;That&#39;s right! Josh is one of the good ones. What kind of people would we be if we started doubting him now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nodded in agreement. &#34;Josh deserves our trust.And besides, Mason can&#39;t have kids anymore. If Josh did drain McCoy Group,who would he even leave it to?The man&#39;s been through so much for this family. We shouldn&#39;t turn on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton started to go up the stairs, the three tried to pull him back, urging him to let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton broke away from their grip and hurried up,only to be stopped at the office door by Josh&#39;s secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a practiced, polite smile, the secretary blocked their path. &#34;I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t go in right now. Mr. McCoy is meeting with a very important guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression turned steely. &#34;And who exactly is in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;A distinguished visitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they had just said Maximo&#39;s name outright, Hamilton might have dropped his guard. But the vagueness only fueled his suspicions. Why not just be direct?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re directors of McCoy Group, too. Why are we&#39;being kept out just because there&#39;s a VIP inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a practiced chuckle. &#34;With all due respect, this is a matter for Mr. McCoy to handle.Is it really your place to interrupt? Besides, Mr. McCoy is at the helm now. Are you here to second-guess his decisions? He&#39;s devoted everything to McCoy Group.Do you really want to question his loyalty?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes flicked to Hamilton, who stood his ground,unyielding. &#34;You&#39;re not the one in charge of McCoy Group anymore, Hamilton. It wouldn&#39;t look good to throw your weight around and embarrass your brother,would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Brad and the others, the secretary added,&#34;Let&#39;s not forget. When nobody else wanted to step up, it was Mr. McCoy who took responsibility. Is this how you repay the one who carried the family through tough times?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those remarks made Brad and the others hesitate,uncertainty flickering across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary glanced at his watch. Just five more minutes and everything would be sealed.Soon,half of the McCoy family&#39;s fortune would be in Josh&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of what was at stake, the rest of the McCoy family exchanged uneasy looks and tugged at Hamilton&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Let&#39;s not push this, Hamilton. It&#39;s probably nothing major. No need to stir up trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules was quick to agree. &#34;He&#39;s right. Let&#39;s just leave and come back another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan,siding with caution, added, &#34;If you&#39;re all staying,I&#39;m leaving. Josh has always treated me well, and l don&#39;t want to upset him over nothing. They said there&#39;s an important guest inside, so maybe it&#39;s something big. McCoy Group&#39;s stock has been shaky.Josh must be under a lot of stress. Let&#39;s not make it worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the others nodded, ready to give up and walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As this conversation ended, more than five minutes had already passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt a growing sense of fear twisting in his gut as the secretary&#39;s posture relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the McCoy family members were about to turn and leave, a low chuckle drifted out from behind the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stopped in their tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad squinted, whispering, &#34;Was that Maximo&#39;s voice?&#34;  &#34;You&#39;re hearing things,&#34; Jules scoffed, glancing at the secretary for reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan insisted, &#34;No way. The only one who could harm us is Daniela. Josh would never betray the family. Let&#39;s just go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before anyone could take another step, the door to the CEO&#39;s office slowly creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the office, Maximo turned toward Josh,extending a firm handshake. &#34;The new partnership is set. Here&#39;s to making a fortune together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both men wore broad, satisfied smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Josh glanced up, he caught sight of his brothers clustered in the doorway, their faces frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cheerful demeanor slipped, replaced by a cool nonchalance. &#34;See Mr. Wagner out,&#34; he told the secretary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a polite gesture, the secretary ushered Maximo away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the door closed, the McCoy brothers stood rooted, still struggling to process what they&#39;d witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, his expression clouded with suspicion,strode into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh, you owe us some answers. That deal with Maximo&#39;s company wasn&#39;t supposed to be finalized yet. What did you just sign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sank back onto the sofa, taking his time as he lit a cigar, arrogance written all over his face. &#34;I&#39;m the CEO of McCoy Group now. Do I really need to justify every contract I sign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You may run McCoy Group, but you still have a responsibility to the family. What exactly did you agree to with Maximo?&#34; Hamilton pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly snapping out of their shock, the McCoy brothers exchanged uneasy glances, suspicion beginning to take root.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad frowned. &#34;What&#39;s going on, Josh? That was clearly Maximo in here, but your secretary just called him an important guest. Why keep it a secret?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; brow furrowed as realization dawned. &#34;We&#39;ve always done annual renewals with Maximo&#39;s company.Why the sudden shift? What changed? What did you actually sign?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, who had just been singing Josh&#39;s praises,suddenly sounded lost. &#34;Josh, you wouldn&#39;t betray us,right?&#34;</p>
