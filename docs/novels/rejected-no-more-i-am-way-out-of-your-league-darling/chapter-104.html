                <p>Alexander stepped out of Daniela&#39;s residence to find Richard waiting expectantly by the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard had taken it upon himself to drive Alexander today,his motives clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Daniela&#39;s soaring influence, Richard was desperate to win her good graces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of anyone else gaining her favor was unbearable to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did things go?&#34; Richard pressed, flashing a sly grin. &#34;Was it a candlelit dinner or a lavish meal? Did Daniela invite you to stay overnight? Remember my advice, Alexander. Don&#39;t be too quick to please her.You need to keep her intrigued. First, secure the lucrative North District project, then aim for the company shares, and finally, make her desperate to marry you. Then, she won&#39;t be able to leave you anymore. And Elite Lux will be firmly in your hands.You&#39;re playing your cards right; you really are my son!&#34;Richard&#39;s voice swelled with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I didn&#39;t have dinner,&#34; Alexander interjected, his tone flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s smile vanished, replaced by a look of utter disbelief. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding Richard&#39;s bewildered gaze, Alexander replied,&#34;I didn&#39;t eat a thing. She had her meal alone and then told me to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, flustered, waved his hand in dismissal.&#34;That can&#39;t be right! Daniela would starve herself before neglecting you like that. Have you done something to upset her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head with a slow, deliberate motion. He recalled how Daniela had disdainfully tossed his sketchbook into the trash can. Her expression was cold, calculating, distant, and eerie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I suspect Daniela doesn&#39;t like me anymore,&#34;Alexander murmured, releasing a weary sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, however, remained unconvinced. &#34;How can you say that? Why did she invite you to dinner if she didn&#39;t even like you? If she truly didn&#39;t give a damn,she wouldn&#39;t even take your calls. And let&#39;s face it,you wouldn&#39;t have lingered up there if she didn&#39;t show some interest.Sometimes,you need to coax a woman.&#34; He pointed to the grand sign adorning the building and continued, &#34;With all this wealth at stake, even if Daniela doesn&#39;t harbor feelings for you now, you must sway her to marry you. Don&#39;t worry. I know charming  women isn&#39;t your strong suit, so I&#39;ve assembled some tools to help you win her heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he took Alexander back to the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they emerged from the car, Alexander&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of a dozen employees lined up at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chimed together in a well-rehearsed chorus.&#34;Good evening!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, Richard ushered Alexander towards the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle push, he swung open the door to an office adorned with an array of photos featuring Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from the desk, a large blackboard dominated the room, covered in extensive analyses of Daniela&#39;s preferences, personality, and the traits she found appealing in a partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve brought in a relationship strategist specifically for your pursuit. They&#39;ve dissected every facet of Daniela&#39;s life to maximize your chances of captivating her heart.&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Richard elaborated on the strategy, his phone buzzed-Katrina was calling. He excused himself with a reassuring pat on Alexander&#39;s shoulder, whispering, &#34;The Bennett family&#39;s future rests on your shoulders now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those parting words, he stepped into the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, Alexander is currently committed to his professional responsibilities and is not considering any romantic entanglements. You&#39;ll need to look elsewhere for a father for your daughter&#39;s child,&#34;Richard stated flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief as she demanded,&#34;What do you mean by that? I thought we had an agreement. Why this sudden change? Richard, are you worried that Caiden might exclude Joyce from his will?You&#39;re overthinking this, really. Joyce is the sole heiress of the Harper family.Who else is there but her?Yes, she slipped up, got pregnant out of wedlock,but I assure you, she&#39;s severed all ties with that man! If you have any further conditions, let&#39;s dscuss them openly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard held his phone at arm&#39;s length, his expression one of scorn. &#34;While Joyce is your treasure,Alexander remains my pride. He will not shoulder the burden of raising another&#39;s child. Should this scandal come to light, the blame would fall squarely on my shoulders,as if I traded my son&#39;s future for your fortune. No wealth is worth that compromise.&#34; Katrina,frantic,attempted to salvage the conversation.&#34;But no one need ever learn of Joyce&#39;s child...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her words were cut short by the harsh beep of the call ending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of fury surged through Katrina, overtaking her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring down the phone, her face twisted in rage, she spat, &#34;Daniela, you fucking bitch! You&#39;ve ruined my plans, and I&#39;ll make damn sure you regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had never imagined that her offhand remarks would cause the Bennett family to reconsider their relationship with Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At breakfast, Katrina had come to cause a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was seated in the dining room, observing Katrina,who looked wild and frantic, her hair a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald, Wyatt, and a few others restrained Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Peyton, unable to contain her frustration any longer,slapped Katrina hard, sending her crumpling to the ground in a flood of tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you all ganging up on me now? Caiden! You have to intervene! Will you just stand there and let me be tormented?&#34; Katrina cried out. From her position on the floor, she pointed accusingly at Daniela through the floor-to-ceiling window.&#34;And look at your ex-wife&#39;s daughter, taking pleasure in my distress! Can you see this? Whose side are you on,Caiden?&#34;</p>
