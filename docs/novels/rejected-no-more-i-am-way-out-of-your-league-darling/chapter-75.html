                <p>Alexander&#39;s face darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words seemed to hit him hard, as though she had just wiped away all the effort and care she had shown him over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So all her affection had been directed at the boy she believed he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this time, she had been striving to please someone who wasn&#39;t truly him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander squeezed his eyes shut, attempting to push back the irritation swelling inside him. But it was pointless. The feeling tightened around his chest, choking him, making it almost impossible to think clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! You&#39;ve got two days. Think it over. When you&#39;re ready, come to Bennett Group with your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot her a cold, hard stare, taking in her stunned, unmoving face before turning away without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood frozen, fighting to hold herself together. But Alexander&#39;s words kept ringing in her ears,shattering her composure. Her body started to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many decades did a person truly get in a lifetime?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ten long years, she had loved Alexander completely, admired him, stood by him, and given up so much for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, he wanted her to hand over the North District project as a mere trade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really about the project?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Alexander, their childhood bond was nothing more than another deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt empty, the weight of it all crashing down. What had she been clinging to all this time? Her love, her loyalty, all the compromises she&#39;d made-they meant nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a bitter joke at her expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body shook with a force she couldn&#39;t control. She struggled to stay upright, leaning forward with her hands braced on her thighs, desperate to regain some balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Lillian&#39;s voice cut through the air as she rushed towards Daniela, security guards on her heels.But by the time they reached the entrance, Alexander was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian came to an abrupt stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never seen Daniela like this, not even when Daniela had ended things with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood in the soft glow of the morning, her legs slightly bent, hands pressing into her thighs for support. Her usual upright, strong posture had vanished, leaving her slumped and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was trembling, not from fear, but from pure, unbridled rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s voice was quiet, hesitant. &#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t face her. Instead, she lifted one hand from her knee, her voice rough and quiet as she said,&#34;I&#39;m fine. You can leave. I just need some time to pull myself together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian paused, uncertain, but then nodded for the security guards to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed at the building&#39;s entrance, her gaze remained locked on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the usual morning rush, with employees coming and going. As they spotted Daniela, many of them instinctively slowed, ready to offer a greeting. But before they could speak, Lillian subtly shook her head,signaling them to move on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the usually lively entrance fell into an unexpected silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Daniela finally managed to straighten up did Lillian hurry over. She took Daniela&#39;s arm, her voice low and filled with concern. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to nod, beads of sweat clungto her pale face, finally slipping down her skin. She spun around and hurried towards the restroom, barely making it before she was seized by a violent wave of nausea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the restroom, Joyce stood in front of the mirror, applying her lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of someone rushing in caught her attention, and she glanced up just in time to see Daniela stumble towards a stall, Lillian hot on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian called out, &#34;Daniela,&#34; Joyce couldn&#39;t help but raise an eyebrow, a hint of amusement crossing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned casually against the doorframe, listening to the sounds of retching from the stall. &#34;Daniela,throwing up this much so early? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian spun around, fury flashing in her eyes as she hissed,&#34;Shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a soft laugh, clearly unfazed by the frustration in Lillian&#39;s voice. &#34;Honestly, Daniela, even though you&#39;re no longer part of the Harper family and we&#39;re not sisters anymore, I feel like I should remind you of something. As women, we know that our first experiences are important. Sure, maybe you&#39;re used to being reckless, but now that you&#39;re leading Elite Lux, shouldn&#39;t you be more careful with your reputation?After all, you wouldn&#39;t want to bring shame to the company,right? But then again, I can see where you&#39;re coming from. Someone like you, always so cold and distant--it&#39;s no surprise you&#39;re all alone. Men probably steer clear of you, don&#39;t they? Unlike me, of course. I&#39;m sweet, obedient, and gentle. Men can&#39;t get enough of me. Cedric, Alexander-men of real class, they&#39;re all at my feet. Tell me, Daniela, what do you think Dad would say if he knew you were fooling around with men before marriage? What if he found out you were pregnant and unmarried? Don&#39;t you think he&#39;d regret not cutting ties with you sooner? You&#39;ve always been a disappointment to the Harper family. And if word got out that you were pregnant out of wedlock, do you really think any wealthy family would want you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that Joyce had been utterly bored in the restroom, trapped with no one to talk to all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when the chance to taunt Daniela came up, she wasn&#39;t about to let it pass her by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her constant jabbering filled the space, and gradually, the emotions choking Daniela&#39;s chest began to dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened up, hit the flush button, and pushed open the stall door. Joyce gasped dramatically, &#34;Daniela! What&#39;s with that pale face? Are you really pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, curiosity practically dripping from her tone. &#34;So, who&#39;s the father of the baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stopped herself from slapping her and instead signaled for Lillian to come over and help her out of the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t stop. &#34;Daniela, you don&#39;t even know who the father is?&#34; Her face contorted into a cruel grin.&#34;Ugh, Daniela! With all the deals the company&#39;s been landing lately, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve been using your body to seal them? Seriously, you&#39;re disgusting! You don&#39;t even know who the father of your child is? But really, that&#39;s how it works, isn&#39;t it? Nobody owns up to, you know, transactions like that. Even if you get pregnant, it&#39;s always the woman left to deal with it. Poor thing! A child growing up fatherless, raised in a home without love-it&#39;s only going to turn out as messed up as you are! Let me give you some..&#34;O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a slap cracked through the air, sharp and final, silencing Joyce mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, everything went quiet. Daniela exhaled deeply, feeling a wave of satisfaction. Sometimes,actions spokelouder than words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Lillian&#39;s support, she made her way out of the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood frozen for a moment, stunned. She then hurried after Daniela, ready to shout at her retreating form, when, out of nowhere, a wave of nausea washed over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach twisted in a sickening churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stumbled back to the toilet, bent over it, gagging and dry heaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the edge of the toilet, Joyce muttered under her breath, &#34;Damn Daniela! Pregnancy isn&#39;t contagious, is it?&#34;</p>
