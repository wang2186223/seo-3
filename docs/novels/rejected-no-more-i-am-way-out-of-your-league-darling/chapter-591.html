                <p>Cedric stood firm, unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett pressed his lips together, unwilling to let Cedric go up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was tall and powerful. If he went up and dragged Huey back, not only would their staged jump fall apart,but Cedric would walk away with the public&#39;s sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would render all their efforts meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s gaze shifted to Daniela, standing just behind Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ruthless as Daniela might be, she was sill a woman-easier to rattle in a high-pressure situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little pressure, a little emotional push-she might cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If events unfolded just as Cedric predicted, with Huey pulling Daniela down with him, then that would be the perfect outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice took on a desperate edge as he turned to the camera, feigning humility with practiced ease. &#34;Please, you have to save Huey. He has an aging mother and three children. If hedies,they&#39;ll be left helpless. I&#39;m begging you-just go up there alone and bring him back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, Hackett dropped to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of his eye, he peeked at the live streamn comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett is vile! Emotional manipulation at its finest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, I feel sick! I actually spent money on their products? Just yesterday, too! No way-I&#39;m getting a refund right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is just one person. Of course, her husband is worried about her going up there alone! If anything goes wrong,can Hackett even take responsibility for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Compared to Huey, Daniela is so much smaller. Ifshe gets pulled down with him, can you imagine what that would do to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric has the right idea. A husband&#39;s first priority is protecting his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flood of comments tilted entirely in Cedric&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett inhaled sharply, irritation bubbling beneath the surface. These people were impossible to manipulate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it! Were these people detectives or what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of tearing Cedric down, he was only making himn look better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett clenched his teeth, swallowing his frustration. He had to push through. He turned to Daniela with a pleading look. &#34;Daniela, think about it. If you save Huey, you&#39;re saving an entire family. You wouldn&#39;t turn your back on them, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett ignored the comment section, his full attention locked onto Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela saw right through Hackett&#39;s performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this was a game of acting, she knew how to play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept silent, dropping her gaze. Her bright eyes darkened, and her lips pressed into a thin line,radiating an air of quiet sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was oblivious, but the live stream audience was outraged. Their comments flared up, condemning how a full-grown man could guilt-trip a young woman like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers on scene glanced at Daniela&#39;s petite frame, then at the much larger man looming on the balcony&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even they could see how unfair this was for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then stay put and use the loudspeaker to talk him down. We&#39;ll handle the rescue, but our first priority is</p>
                
                
                
                <p>safety. And honestly? Your husband&#39;s concerns aren&#39;t wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey had been hanging on to this act for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela still hadn&#39;t shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind was growing stronger, and his legs were starting to ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Huey spotted Cedric making his way towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression was stone-cold, an almost lethal presence radiating from him as he fixed Huey with an icy stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I hear you&#39;re planning to jump?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice was flat, emotionless, as if to say, &#34;You want to die?Then get on with it. But leave my wife out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey instinctively shrank back. Then, catching Hackett&#39;s signal, he hurriedly blurted out, &#34;I need to see Daniela! Where is she? Everyone else, get lost! I won&#39;t talk to anyone but Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a low chuckle, casually crossing his arms. &#34;Anything you need to say? Say it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey narrowed his eyes. &#34;Why should I talk to you? I asked for Daniela, the owner of Elite Lux!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood firm, his confidence effortless. &#34;Elite Lux is hers. But Daniela? She&#39;s mine. She makes the big calls, but I handle the small stuff. So, go ahead.What is it you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just call jumping off a building small stuff?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey was so furious, he nearly stomped over to argue with Cedric right then and there.</p>
