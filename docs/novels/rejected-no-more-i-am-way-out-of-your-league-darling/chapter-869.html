                <p>Now that Cedric knew it. Daniela didn&#39;t want to hide it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied honestly, &#34;Yes, I had a meal with Hamilton.Carol&#39;sprobablyalready spilledevery detail,hasn&#39;tshe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to beSO straightforward today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he just watched her, uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted in her seat, curling her fingers around a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentle light painted her expression with a frosty calm,making her look even more distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of worry tightened in Cedric&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had questions swirling in his mind, but none of them seemed safe to ask. After a heavy pause, he finally asked, &#34;Are you planning to leave me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips pressed together, her silence stretching the moment thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s chest tightened, his pulse thudding as he</p>
                
                
                
                <p>waited,barely breathing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain that the promise of long-buried answers would lure Daniela away from him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow sense of powerlessness washed over him. He dropped his gaze, knuckles whitening as his fists pressed hard against his knees</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the heavy silence, Daniela finally spoke,her tone calm, almost gentle. &#34;Today, Hamilton told me something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile softened, losing its usual edge, and Cedric felt the tension in his chest loosen just a little</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He mentioned that when you visited him last time,the Loglil princess happened to be dining upstairs.She saw you and wants to marry you. It sounds like Hamilton is more than a little invested in the idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused and took a careful sip, the cool water soothing her throat before going on, &#34;She wants you to divorce me and marry her. Hamilton keeps talking about how wealthy they are, and I checked-he&#39;s right.Their kind don&#39;t drink out of anything less than gold,and they don&#39;t need to lift a finger in their daily life-servants will do anything for them. They spend their days lounging in sprawling estates, sipping wine under crystal chandeliers, floating from one party to the next. Evenings are all glittering galas and moonlit dances.&#34; Suddenly. Daniela&#39;s voice turned teasing. &#34;And yes,looked up the princess. She&#39;s gorgeous-tall,refined,and has that practiced royal poise. I&#39;ll give her that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She delivered it with an easy nonchalance, like she was simply filling space with conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric&#39;s chest tightened with every word, the fear unmistakable in his gaze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if Daniela was quietly building up to letting him go-urging him to chase a life of luxury he could never find with her His eyes brimmed with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers drifted lightly over Cedric&#39;s eyelids.brushing away the tension there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dropped his gaze, shoulders slumping in defeat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Truth be told, if I were living in that kind of luxury,might just get used to it-and even like it,&#34; Daniela mused,her voice calm but unreadable</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pushed the door open, sensing the tense atmosphere inside. She paused for a moment before asking, &#34;Are you two hungry? I could really use something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set her glass down and offered a gentle nod.&#34;Let&#39;s head home and get some dinner,&#34; she said to Cedric,her tone steady But Cedric just sat there, his appetite gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s words echoed in his mind, each one a fresh wound. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that she was preparing to leave him for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They left together, but the drive back was wordless-every mile thick with unspoken unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept sneaking glances at Daniela, desperate for a sign of hope, but she stared blankly out the window,her face from time to time lit by the glow of passing streetlights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each flash of light made Cedric&#39;s heart sink further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was a dismal affair. Cedric didn&#39;t touch his food,just sat there lost in his own storm of dread</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned to the dining room after a brief phone call, she immediately noticed his absence.&#34;Where&#39;s Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pointed upstairs without looking up. She was wolfing down her food,having skipped lunch earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he was full and headed up. I guess he&#39;s done for the night,&#34; she mumbled,mouth full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Daniela wasn&#39;t much for cooking, she simply reheated a sandwich and carried it upstairs. She found Cedric sitting on the edge of the bed.looking absolutely defeated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; She sat beside him and offered the warm sandwich</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at the sandwich for a long moment. He wanted to speak up for himself, but every word caught in his throat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking the truth had always been the one thing Daniela couldn&#39;t let go of He knew it, so he couldn&#39;t bring himself to ask her to give up her pursurt and choose him instead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reached over and brushed his forehead, her touch gentle and reassuring</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met her eyes, and suddenly, the dam broke. He seized her hand, pulled her tightly into his arms, and his words spilled out in a low, desperate rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you not leave me? I don&#39;t want some princess.I don&#39;t care about fancy titles or rubbing elbows with nobles. I only want you. That&#39;s it. Let me be the one to find your answers-just give me a little time. Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice faltered,raw with longing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, all he heard was the anxious thudding of his heart-until Daniela&#39;s quiet laugh broke the tension. &#34;What on earth are you saying?&#34; she teased, a wry smile tugging at her lips. &#34;Who said I was leaving?Earlier in the office, I just woke up from a nap and felt out of sorts. I wanted to talk to you,that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared, dumbfounded, hope flickering in his eyes &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Didn&#39;t Carol mention it? I wrote two words on the divorce agreement-&#39;fuck off&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the dread he&#39;d been choking down finally vanished,replaced by a stunned relief</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes widened, then turned glassy as tears threatened. &#34;She never told me! That woman! She nearly gave me a heart attack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela straightened, unwrapped the sandwich, and pressed it into his hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but smile as Cedric bowed his head and started eating like a scolded child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What had you so rattled?&#34; she asked lightly. &#34;Look at me-I could only make a sandwich. I ought to be the one worried. You&#39;re the talented one in this marriage.If I say I&#39;m hungry, you&#39;d tumn the whole kitchen upside down to cook for me. Honestly, what would I do without you? I&#39;d probably starve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked up, his laughter spilling out-unguarded and infectious For once, the weight on his shoulders seemed to lift. &#34;You mean that? Honey, nothing would make me happier. I&#39;d cook for you every single day.&#34;</p>
