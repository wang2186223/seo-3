                <p>Jack tightened his fists. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m the her to Elite Lux.I&#39;ll protect you, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gave a small nod, visibly relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela moved in, Tasha was in the middle of packing up her things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re willing to stay, I&#39;ll hire you,&#34; said Daniela. &#34;I really likeyour cooking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha paused, glanced at her, and after a few seconds,nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came back with her belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a bitter scoff. &#34;Loyalty means nothing to people anymore. I begged you to stay, and it was useless. Then she speaks one word, and you&#39;re unpacking again. Tell me, Tasha,does her money look shinier than mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela entered the room just then, her eyes locked on Joyce. &#34;This is my house, so think before you talk.If you keep running your mouth, I&#39;ll throw you out. You believe me, don&#39;t you?&#34; Joyce started to reply but gave up halfway. lips pressed in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha glanced at Daniela, realizing she was nothing like the woman from the gossip sites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was firm,clear-headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha started up the stairs with a basket, but Daniela waved her off. &#34;You don&#39;t need to handle that.Someone else will take care of the room. Just focus on the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha looked at Daniela again, this time with a hint of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was like a natural leader who kept everything under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, people moved in and out of the house,handling the bedrooms. By the time Tasha finished making lunch, the upstairs had already been set right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went up to check it herself. Not only had the master and guest rooms been cleaned, but every upstairs room had been rearranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place looked completely different. Like new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dining table, Caiden, Joyce, and Jack sat across from Daniela and Carol. Cedric joined them shortly after. &#34;I like calm,&#34; said Daniela, picking up her fork So if you&#39;re going to live here, stay quiet. I don&#39;t tolerate drama. And if you test me. you already know what&#39;ll happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she said it, Caiden leaned back, his face pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce tensed up, grabbed Jack, and stormed away. A chair screeched as she kicked it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen doorway, Tasha watched Daniela eat like none of it fazed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,who usually had a complaint ready, sat frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About thirty minutes passed after lunch. Joyce came down with Jack and faced Tasha in the kitchen. &#34;Make me something else. I&#39;m still huungry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha glanced over. Daniela sat in the living room,flipping through channels like she didn&#39;t have a care in the world. Her face stayed cold and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kitchen&#39;s closed after meals. Miss Harper made that clear,&#34; said Tasha, locking the kitchen door right in front of Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face turned red. She stormed off to confront Daniela. &#34;Are you seriously planning to starve me and Jack?&#34; Daniela kept clicking the remote. The TV light bounced across the room, paintingflickers on the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t speak. Her expression stayed sharp and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her gaze cut to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze.A chill crept up her neck, and she backed up half a step. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t go too far. You acted like a victim out there, but this is the real you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her eyes back to the screen. &#34;Here&#39;s how it is, Joyce. Tasha works for me now. Her job is to serve me and my people. And once meals are done,the kitchen is off-limits. Also, you and Caiden will be paying ten thousand a month. If you can&#39;t afford it, I&#39;ll show you the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce snapped, &#34;You&#39;re charging me to live here?Aren&#39;t you afraid I&#39;ll take Jack and leave, never to return? Think this through. Jack, Dad, and I are the only family you&#39;ve got. You can&#39;t have kids. That means no heirs, no one to care for you when you&#39;re old. Are you really ready to lose us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years ago, Daniela might have laughed. These days,she rarely did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at Joyce like she wasn&#39;t even alive.′′|′Valready thought it through. I live in the now. Some  problems? I&#39;ll handle them when Im old. And didn&#39;t you say you were leaving anyway? Tasha, go help her pack Jack&#39;s things. Make sure everything is wrapped up neatly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce burst into tears and ran outside to find Caiden.He was hiding in the yard, hoping not to get dragged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you have to rile her up? Keep your head down. Daniela&#39;s got money, power, and no patience. If she kicks us out, where are we going to find another place like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her jaw. &#34;Fine.She wins-for now. But one day she&#39;ll need Jack, and when that day comes,I won&#39;t make it easy for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded. &#34;Right. She can&#39;t have children.All we need to do is wait.Once she&#39;s out of the picture, her stuff becomes ours. No point fighting now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And deep down, he knew the truth. Nobody beat Daniela when it came to being ruthless.</p>
