                <p>The charity auction had just wrapped up, and Cedric escorted Lydia towards Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia&#39;s red gown shimmered under the lights,drawing lingering gazes from passersby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Cedric, then arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People often described this rebellious CEO as cold,ruthless, and an unapproachable man exuding a sharp, commanding presence. And he never showed interest in women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia had joined Phillips Group because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she thought getting close to Cedric would be impossible. She&#39;d been strategizing ways to approach him when, out of nowhere, she received an invitation to the charity auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had dressed to impress. But the entire night,Cedric had never once spared her a glance.  However, when Daniela appeared, a flicker of emotion had crossed Cedric&#39;s usually cold expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Cedric&#39;s expression was unreadable. Was it worry or frustration? Maybe even irritation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Mr. Phillips, am I just a convenient distraction tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had grown up in an orphanage, hardened by a life that left little room for conscience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt was a foreign feeling except when it came to Daniela. To him, everyone else was insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back, exuding effortless arrogance, his tone as indifferent as ever. &#34;If I recall,your contract states that when an opportunity for exposure arises,you&#39;re supposed to cooperate with the company&#39;s arrangements. So, there&#39;s no question of diversions.It&#39;s mutual benefit, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia was momentarily taken aback before a slow smile curved her lips. &#34;You&#39;re brutally honest, Mr.Phillips,&#34; she murmured, shifting slightly, her silhouette illuminated by the car lights, a deliberate flirtation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop the car.&#34; Cedric&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver obeyed instantly, pulling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out!&#34; Cedric demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia stared at him. &#34;We&#39;re on an overpass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was unyielding, his tone merciless. &#34;I said,get ouut.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the driver stepped out, opened the door, and said with the same cold detachment,&#34;Miss Vargas, please step out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Lydia stepped out. The moment her heels touched the pavement, the driver shut the door, slid back into the car, and stepped on the gas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek vehicle disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia clenched her teeth, frustrated. Stepping out in her high heels, she barely caught her balance as the wind tugged at her gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spat at the retreating taillights. &#34;Jerk!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Cedric remained silent, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery while the diver concentrated on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his mind was elsewhere. He kept seeing Daniela&#39;s expression from earlier when she saw him and Lydia at the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was losing his damn mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he come up with such a stupid idea?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the front passenger seat, his secretary, who had been holding back his frustration, finally snapped.&#34;Mr. Phillips, you crossed the line tonight. Forget how the press will spin this. Do you have any idea what this must&#39;ve hurt your wife? She&#39;s always distant with outsiders, but with us at Phillips Group, kind and approachable. Do you know why? Because of you.She&#39;s been doing her best to comfort you, and this is how you repay her. Did you even see her face when she looked at you tonight? You&#39;ve spoiled her so much and still did this to her? She left early tonight.She must have been devastated. If you keep this up,don&#39;t be surprised if she walks away from you for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last sentence landed like a slap and Cedric&#39;s whole body tensed. &#34;I wasn&#39;t thinking then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The charity auction had been another tiresome and boring social event. CEOs often brought secretaries or companions. They didn&#39;t often bring their wives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted to show his displeasure. He hadn&#39;t meant to use Lydia to provoke Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary scoffed. &#34;Typical. When men get what they want, they stop valuing it. You spent years fighting for her. Now look at you. You&#39;ve turned into a complete asshole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary sided with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, silently gripping the wheel, hesitated before speaking. &#34;Mr. Phillips, your wife didn&#39;t seem well tonight.&#34; Cedric&#39;s head snapped up, his sharp gaze locking onto the driver. &#34;What did you just say?&#34; His voice held an edge of urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver swallowed. &#34;I mean it. When you were inside, I stepped out for a smoke. When I came back,I saw your wife and Lillian leaving. Lillian bent down to ask if she was okay. Your wife stood by the door for a long time as if struggling to catch her breath.I ran to grab a bottle of water, but by the time I got back, they were already gone. Ryan was driving. He sped off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hand, resting on his knee, trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-A suffocating silence filled the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary looked at him and sighed, rubbing his temple. &#34;You should talk to her. You know she&#39;s not unreasonable. It was just a charity auction. Explain yourself before this gets worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary comforted him. The car slowed as they neared the Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver suddenly spoke. &#34;Mr. Phillips, it&#39;s Lillian! It looks like she is seeing someone off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shoved the door open. Across the street, a black car was pulling away. Lillian stood beside it,watching. At first, she smiled but as her eyes met Cedric&#39;s, the warmth drained from her expression.Her gaze turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary and driver exchanged nervous glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was bad!</p>
