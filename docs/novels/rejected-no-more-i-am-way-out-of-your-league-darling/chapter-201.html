                <p>Cedric shot Caiden a cold, piercing glare. &#34;Look what you got me into!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shrank back instinctively, his frustration and grievance palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden trudged upstairs, his gaze caught Cedric knocking hesitantly on Daniela&#39;s door. Cedric looked uncharacteristically subdued, as though unsure of his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a stark contrast to the authoritative warning he had delivered downstairs moments earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without lingering, Caiden retreated to his room, his mind swirling with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained at Daniela&#39;s door, his expression softening into an unconvincing smile. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Daniela, fresh from a shower, exuded an effortless allure. Her long, damp curls framed her face,cascading over her shoulders with a natural elegance. Draped in pristine white loungewear,she looked both ethereal and serene, as though she belonged in a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seated cross-legged on the plush carpet,her fingers deftly working on a half-completed puzzle. With a casual gesture, she pointed to the space opposite her. &#34;Have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her gentle demeanor, Cedric couIdn&#39;t shake the feeling that her sharp gaze saw straight through him,peeling back layers he hadn&#39;t meant to expose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained rooted to the spot. &#34;It&#39;s late. I won&#39;t intrude.Is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply immediately. She lowered her gaze, her fingers picking up a stray puzzle piece from the floor. With a practiced ease, she slid it into its rightful place. &#34;Why did you transfer money to me?&#34; &#34;I told you, it was just a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer the quiet lingered, the more Cedric&#39;s unease grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His guilt churned, swelling into something he could no longer suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Daniela finally asked, her voice cool and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted slowly, and she glanced at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the middle of the night, you transferred three hundred million. Can I ask why?&#34; Daniela picked up another puzzle piece and fitted it effortlessly into the growing picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt the sweat trickling down his back. His earlier shower now seemed utterly pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t explain it, but he had a sinking suspicion that Daniela already knew the truth. Her calm exterior didn&#39;t waver. When she finally glanced up again, her expression was gentle, devoid of judgment, and yet it carried a weight Cedric couldn&#39;t ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though she was just asking casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pressed his lips together, struggling to concoct a believable excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could speak, Daniela&#39;s voice interrupted his thoughts. &#34;Forget it, it&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ve already transferred it back to you. Go get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as Cedric turned to close the door, Daniela remained on the floor, her focus on the intricate puzzle pieces spread before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door, which should have clicked shut, stayed slightly ajar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew he should leave. Staying any longer might unravel the carefully guarded secrets he was trying so desperately to conceal, leaving him exposed-ridiculous and foolish in her eyes. But his  feet refused to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand lingered on the doorknob, the weight of his guilt pressing heavily on his chest. It was an unbearable torment, gnawing at him with every passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door, instead of closing, slowly opened wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric moved forward, sinking onto the carpet where she had motioned for him to sit earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tight knot of anxiety twisting in his stomach began to loosen, albeit only slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were reasons that Cedric couldn&#39;t share.Secrets that, if revealed, might tarnish the fragile trust Daniela held in her family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could become Daniela&#39;s family if she was okay with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want Daniela to become cold and indifferent because of someone like Caiden. It wasn&#39;t worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even with his resolve, he couldn&#39;t bear to see Daniela unhappy. So, he stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela finally looked up, her eyes met Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed the turmoil etched into his features. The tight furrow of his brows, the rare flicker of regret shadowing his otherwise composed eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few seconds, she just stared, her expression unreadable. &#34;Are you hiding something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric flinched at the question. &#34;What? No,no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t push. Instead, she placed the puzzle piece she&#39;d been holding onto the floor and stood,stretching gracefully. &#34;I&#39;m tired. You should get some sleep too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained on the floor, his posture stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t acknowledge him further. With an air  of quiet detachment, she lay on the bed, pulling the blanket over herself before turning off the main light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room plunged into a comforting darkness,softened by the faint, warm glow of a bedside lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze drifted to the figure in the bed, and he didn&#39;t leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the bed, reached for the scattered puzzle pieces, and began piecing them together.</p>
