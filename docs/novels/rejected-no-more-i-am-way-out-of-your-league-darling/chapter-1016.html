                <p>The midday sunlight was harsh and glaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reeking ditch stretched out behind the concealed spot where Josh and Jules waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unbearable smell worsened in the heat, sending waves of acrid stench into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gagged repeatedly, and Jules soon followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their retching echoed in the silence until they couldn&#39;t endure it any longer and moved across the street to wait inside their car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time dragged on at a sluggish pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained inside, but eventually, Hamilton stepped out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Josh flung the car door open and got out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, I thought you&#39;d be staying for dinner at Daniela&#39;s place?&#34; Josh called out, eager to see Hamilton&#39;s face twisted in grief over his lost grandkids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage surged through Hamilton,and he almost lunged at Josh on sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he wasn&#39;t stupid-no matter what he accused Josh of, the man would just deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been right-he couldn&#39;t outsmart Josh.But that hardly mattered, because Josh wasn&#39;t capable of outwitting Daniela either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, shooting Josh a sharp look. &#34;What&#39;s.wrong? Why do you care? What are you doing loitering near Daniela&#39;s door?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave a strained laugh. &#34;Come on, I was just passing through and saw you. That&#39;s all. You&#39;re walking around, looking all puffed up just because you&#39;ll have grandkids. Don&#39;t get too cocky-you might regret it before long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh!&#34; Hamilton thundered, voice booming loud enough to make Josh flinch. &#34;If Father were still alive and saw what you&#39;ve become, do you really think he&#39;d still love you? He&#39;d be ashamed to have raised an idiot like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh froze in disbelief. &#34;You actually called me an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s exactly what I said. You&#39;re an idiot-old, bitter,and rotten to the core! Let me tell you something,Josh-what goes around comes around. You&#39;re doomed.&#34;With that,Hamilton turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh remained frozen in place, too stunned to speak,his mind reeling in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha! What nonsense was Hamilton spouting? If anyone&#39;s doomed, it&#39;s Daniela-not me.&#34; Time kept moving, slow and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton came back, the house remained quiet with no sign of activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh elbowed Jules, who was glued to his phone.&#34;Go with Hamilton into the house. Find out what&#39;s happening. Why isn&#39;t Daniela dead yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules kept his eyes on the screen. &#34;Why don&#39;t you do it? I&#39;m in the middle of a game here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh lost his temper, grabbed Jules&#39; phone, and shattered it. &#34;Move it! How can you sit here playing games when things are this serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules looked hurt. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go in yourself then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh snapped, &#34;You think I want to send you?Hamilton&#39;s full of himself lately-if I show up, he&#39;ll just humiliate me. Now hurry up and get moving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules opened the car door and strolled over to Hamilton with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton eyed him coldly. &#34;What now? Out for a walk too? You and Josh sure have time to waste-hanging around my daughter-in-law&#39;s front door all day like you&#39;ve got nothing better to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules forced a smile. &#34;Come on, Hamilton, no need to get so riled up in this heat. We&#39;re not here to cause trouble. We even dropped off some health supplements for Daniela earlier. Josh may be hardheaded, but deep down, he means well. We&#39;re still family-family looks out for one another. You really think we&#39;d hurt your grandkids?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mentioning that only stoked Hamilton&#39;s simmering fury, which he was barely keeping in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unaware of the rising tension, Jules smiled and.said, &#34;Here, I brought another supplement. MMind if I come in with you to see how Daniela&#39;s doing?&#34;</p>
