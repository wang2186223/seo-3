                <p>Katrina saw Caiden&#39;s expression clearly, yet she felt no urge to comfort him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Joyce now married to Alexander and a substantial fortune in her grasp, Katrina saw no reason for fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she aged, Joyce would care for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Joyce wasn&#39;t Caiden&#39;s biological daughter,she was undeniably Katrina&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina knew that Caiden, having cut ties with Daniela, would have to depend on her. She had spent most of her life serving him. Now it was finally her time to enjoy a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be heading home,&#34; Katrina told him, her gaze indifferent. &#34;A caregiver will look after you1. Once you&#39;ve recovered, you can head home as well.&#34; Caiden&#39;s eyes widened, filled with disbelief.&#34;You&#39;re leaving me here by myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although his condition was manageable, Katrina had never left his side before, even for minor concerns like a blood pressure check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she was walking away, leaving him behind in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she remain so unaffected by it all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina adjusted her hair, a slight smile playing on her lips, she seemed to read his thoughts effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s no big deal. The doctor expects your recovery in a few days. Why the fuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to leave but paused just as she reached the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Caiden wondered if she had changed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina added coldly, &#34;Since you&#39;re fine, don&#39;t bother Joyce about this. She&#39;s lost face before the Bennett family because of you. You have your own daughter. Leave Joyce out of it. And by the way,my mother will take care of Jack since you&#39;re unwell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden froze, his eyes wide in disbelief. &#34;What? But you said your mother was dead!&#34; He grasped his head,his heart racing with the surreal turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did l?&#34; Katrina responded, her voice devoid of emotion. &#34;Well, perhaps she&#39;s come back to life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she walked out of the room, her steps echoing a carefree rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sat motionless in the hospital bed, unable to move or respond for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really the wife he had loved for so many years? The daughter he had pampered for decades?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Katrina got home, Daniela was already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat relaxed in the living room, eating a plate of fruit that Cedric had prepared for her. She was watching TV with Ryan and Lillian, enjoying a variety show as bursts of laughter rang out occasionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know your father&#39;s in the hospital?&#34; Katrina called to Daniela, shutting the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Daniela kept her focus on the TV, eating her fruit. Then, she turned to Katrina with a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you smiling?&#34; Katrina asked, her voice shaking. She couldn&#39;t hide it, she was becoming more and more afraid of Daniela. When Daniela chose to be cruel, it was terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother with your schemes, Katrina,&#34; Daniela replied coldly, maintaining her composure. &#34;You know I can ruin Joyce&#39;s life quite easily. You wouldn&#39;t want that, would you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt her smile stiffen. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me be clear. Joyce&#39;s comfort depends on my happiness. She might have the shares in the robotics company, but remember, I have endless means to bankrupt you both. Would you dare challenge me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Daniela&#39;s face never faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a serene smile, but the words she spoke sent a chill through Katrina, freezing her to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save your hypocritical talk,&#34; Daniela warned. &#34;Try me again, and I&#39;ll have you thrown out of this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flushed with a mix of rage and embarrassment,Katrina felt her cheeks burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A maid moved to intervene, but Cedric&#39;s stern look halted her immediately, and she stepped back,choosing not to provoke him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I refuse to engage on your disgraceful level!&#34;Katrina said, storming up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in her room, she pressed a hand to her chest,her heartbeat racing wildly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she.was reluctant to acknowledge it,Daniela&#39;s cold stare earlier had planted a deep,unnerving fear in her. &#34;Daniela, that lunatic! As if I would waste my time talking to her!&#34;</p>
