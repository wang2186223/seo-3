                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;Joyce, how dare you claim the Bennett family&#39;s wealth yours? it has nothing to do with you. Moreover, you&#39;re the one having an affair. You deserve nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce looked at Richard with a chilly gaze. &#34;What? Do all women who marry into your family have to leave empty-handed? I am not Daniela. If you care about your family&#39;s reputation, you should giveme half of the assets. Otherwise, don&#39;t blame me for making things awkward!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce ascended the stairs. &#34;I&#39;ll give you one night to think it over. If you don&#39;t transfer the funds by tomorrow, I&#39;ll release the scandalous photos of me and the man. Then, Bennett Group&#39;s stocks will take another hit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remained below, watching Joyce disappear into her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anger was so intense he thought he might have a heart attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was nothing but a bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was ready to tarnish her own reputation for a man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was threatening to expose her infidelity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could the Harper family have raised such disparate daughters?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Daniela had departed quietly without any drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Joyce seemed like a person possessed by a demon, hell-bent on destroying the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a malevolent woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard tried to reach Alexander, but all attempts to contact him failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no other options, he decided to call Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, reclining on the sofa, could hear Richard&#39;s voice on the other end, lashing out at Joyce. Nearby, Johan observed Daniela&#39;s stoic expression as she continued to watch TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he suspected that Daniela was somehow linked to this entire debacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had masterminded the ruin of these people silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he was lost in his thoughts, Daniela slowly raised her eyes to meet his in a silent, icy stare that lasted a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan felt a tight grip of anxiety as he clenched his hands on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her attention back to the TV, her expression unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s voice filled the living room. &#34;Joyce has really outdone herself! Do you know what she told me?I can hardly say it! She wants half of the Bennett family&#39;s assets now. I won&#39;t go into details, but Katrina, is my family&#39;s wealth what you&#39;re really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katrina could reply, Richard continued, &#34;If that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, then fine, let&#39;s throw caution to the wind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, Katrina apologized. &#34;Joyce has lost her mind. That&#39;s why she&#39;s behaving like this. Please, don&#39;t be angry. I&#39;ll speak to my daughter. Let&#39;s not mention divorce. She&#39;s still young, and everyone makes mistakes at times. Let&#39;s just say Joyce is indebted to Alexander for this. We&#39;ll compensate him later, so please, calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Katrina offered a barrage of soothing words, Richard hung up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina then reached out to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce respondedcurtly, &#34;Either you get me the money, or I will divorce Alexander. The choice is yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katrina was about to reply, the call abruptly ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina remained in the living room for a long while, visibly frustrated and tugging at her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally looked up, her eyes met Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Johan saw Cedric narrowing his eyes.&#34;Daniela,&#34; Katrina said boldly, &#34;you heard everything, didn&#39;t you? We&#39;re all family. You need to help me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniele changed the channel on the TV with the remote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not much, just lend me ten million, okay?&#34; Katrina added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled briefly. &#34;So now you need money/to support Joyce&#39;s man? That&#39;s quite unexpected!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pursed her lips, tightened her grip, and seemed to come to a firm decision. &#34;Daniela, I won&#39;t just borrow your money. At an auction once, I won something quite valuable. Let me know how much you&#39;d want for it, alright? Consider it a purchase from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Katrina returned from her room holding a brocade box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela casually glanced up, but her expression froze in shock upon seeing Katrina&#39;s item.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric immediately perceived a shift in Daniela&#39;s emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Daniela, Katrina opened the box to reveal a radiant, luminous pearl.&#34;Could this be worth ten million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blankness in Daniela&#39;s eyes slowly gave way to a profound, icy intensity. Her gaze shifted from the pearl to Katrina&#39;s face, and she scoffed derisively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt her heart miss a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this yours?&#34; Daniela inquired,her tone icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina inhaled deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brylee jumped off the building, she had this pearl in her hand.	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally intended as part of a crown for her daughter&#39;s wedding, Brylee had the pearl with her that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Brylee&#39;s leap, Katrina found the invaluable pearl and took it for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, she intended to give it to Joyce as a wedding gift. However, as Daniela&#39;s influence expanded, Katrina reconsidered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,facing desperate circumstances, she felt compelled to take a risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wagered that Daniela was too young at the time to recognize the pearl&#39;s worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She speculated that Brylee had never shown the pearl to Daniela and that Daniela was too young to recall any of it.</p>
