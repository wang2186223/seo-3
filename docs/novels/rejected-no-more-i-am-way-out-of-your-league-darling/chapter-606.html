                <p>Farley gazed at the written confession in disbelief.&#34;You&#39;ve confessed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey,typically the epitome of lightheartedness,now bore a grave look. &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve confessed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you grasp the gravity of what you&#39;ve done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, Huey replied, &#34;Absolutely, but you said it yourself,didn&#39;t you? To safeguard your company and family, you&#39;d go to any length. Moreover,we were at fault,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tumult of emotions danced across Farley&#39;s eyes as he lapsed into silence again, wrestling with his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Farley&#39;s voice, thick with emotion, broke the silence. &#34;But I don&#39;t want to dredge up the past.Brylee has been gone for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey,shaking his head, cradled his granddaughter closer. &#34;For us, it may be history since we benefited.But for Daniela, the past still lingers. She&#39;s trapped in the moment her mother died, her eyes filled with accusation, branding us murderers. All she seeks is justice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently caressing his granddaughter&#39;s hair,Huey added,&#34;I&#39;ve come to greatly respect her bravery. Her mother would have been profoundly touched to witness her relentless pursuit of justice after all these years. I aspire to be someone who inspires others. I want the kids in my family to grow up respecting their grandfather, not seeing him as a coward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley lapsed into silence, lost in his thoughts. After a heavy pause, he resolved himself and whispered to Huey, &#34;If I confess everything to Daniela and face the consequences, will she forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey gave a reassuring nod. &#34;Absolutely. Daniela is fair. Farley, blindly following Hackett will lead you nowhere but a dead end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley pursed his lips, then nodded resolutely. &#34;Alright,I&#39;ll go and see Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey gently set his granddaughter down. &#34;I&#39;ll accompany you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to step out, Huey abruptly halted, realizing he had forgotten his coat, so he asked Farley to wait outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he turned, a black car parked across the street erupted in a violent explosion. Farley,who had just stepped in, was engulfed in the blast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey stood rooted to the spot, his mind reeling from the shock, unable to move for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,he managed to pull out his phone and dialed Daniela, his voice quaking. &#34;Hackett has struck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped onto the scene, thick plumes of black smoke billowed from the wreckage of the exploded car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It had to be Hackett!&#34; Huey said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,her face set against the biting wind, addressed Huey firmly. &#34;Surrender to the authorities. You&#39;ll be safer in jail. I&#39;ll ensure your family is safe abroad, and once this chaos subsides, they&#39;ll return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, his expression resolute, nodded in agreement.&#34;I was thinking along the same lines. Please, look after them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bid his family farewell and turned himself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On that very day, his family was safely ensconced on a private jet, bound for foreign shores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Hackett&#39;s association crumbled, leaving him utterly alone. Driven by Daniela&#39;s relentless efforts, Perry Group crumbled under financial strain and declared bankruptcy. Encircled by debt collectors, Hackett made a desperate leap from a high-rise, ending his torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arrived at the scene on the day of his demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain cascaded around her as she stood, her gaze cold and unwavering, observing the fallen man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty years prior, her mother had lain similarly still,a quiet figure on the cold ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the architect of her despair had met his own grim fate, plummeting from a towering height, a direct consequence of his nefarious deeds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow was taken aback when Daniela appeared unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, it&#39;s been quite some time.&#34; Winslow greeted her with a warm smile, eyes twinkling. &#34;l&#39;ve caught wind of the latest happenings. You&#39;re truly formidable,dismantling such a mighty association with apparent ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela settled into the chair across from him, her eyes sharp and piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow, attempting to lighten the mood, leaned in to pour her a cup of coffee. &#34;So, what&#39;s the occasion for this unexpected pleasure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was thin and calculating. &#34;I&#39;m sure you can guess the real reason behind my visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Winslow&#39;s hand wavered, his voice faltering. &#34;I must admit, I&#39;m at a loss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was radiant yet haunting, sending shivers through Winslow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her pocket, pulled out a cufflink,and set it down on the table with a soft clink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow paled, his face losing all color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This cufflink was in my mother&#39;s grasp when she passed. You always had a taste for this brand&#39;s exquisite designs.&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice was calm but firm.&#34;Should I take action, or will you handle it yourself? If I act, your company will be uprooted. If you turn yourself in, you can leave something for your family.I&#39;ll give you a day to make a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela stood up from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Winslow turned himself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the truth about Brylee&#39;s murder came to light,it sent shockwaves through everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compassion flowed for Brylee, while resentment surged against the association. Daniela, cloaked in mourning black, made her solitary way to Brylee&#39;s grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,justice has been served on those who wronged you.Have you seen? Your son-in-law&#39;s name is Cedric Phillips. I hesitated to introduce him earlier, fearing our marriage might crumble under the strain of these troubles. Should the opportunity arise, I&#39;ll bring him by to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, gathering her thoughts, then added, &#34;I&#39;m also carrying a child. We don&#39;t know yet if it&#39;s a boy or a girl, but Cedric is overjoyed. I believe you would have been ecstatic too, delighting in the chance to dote on your grandchild. It&#39;s truly a shame. Mom, l promise to lead a good life. You don&#39;t need to worry about me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dusk embraced the sky, a vibrant red hue bled across the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Daniela laid down a bouquet of flowers, whispering, &#34;Mom, I&#39;ll come see you again soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the same day, Elite Lux&#39;s and Phillips Group&#39;s websites announced Daniela&#39;s pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To commemorate this joyous news, Elite Lux slashed prices on all luxury items by fifty percent, igniting a thrilling shopping spree! Meanwhile, a figure glared at the Elite Lux building,fists clenched in silent fury.</p>
