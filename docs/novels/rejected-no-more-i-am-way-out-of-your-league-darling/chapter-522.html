                <p>The crowd voiced their approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Stop supplying Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let Daniela see what we&#39;re made of!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, don&#39;t worry. We support you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices overlapped in the room. Yet, Marc Green remained silent in his chair, uttering not a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the harsh world of business, any sign of weakness could provoke an attack. The same friends who supported him today might exploit him if he showed any real vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett looked over at Marc, who was quiet, and smiledslightly. &#34;Marc, why so silent? It&#39;s not the end of the world. Your business doesn&#39;t rely solely on Daniela&#39;s orders, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man interjected, &#34;Exactly! Our association is strong. If Daniela stops her orders, we&#39;ll help you.What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, you&#39;ve always complained about Elite Lux&#39;s strict standards. Now&#39;s your chance to break away and prove your worth. Isn&#39;t this the perfect opportunity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Marc. Daniela is just a woman. What&#39;s there to be afraid of? What can she really do to you? She&#39;ll come crawling back for your materials soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group&#39;s enthusiasm grew as they spoke louder, their confidence building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all were eager to bring Daniela down a notch.。</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of a successful company led by a woman seemed to irritate these men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were determined to undermine her, asserting that true success was still a man&#39;s domain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, they believed the reputation of their trade association shouldn&#39;t suffer because of this. Marc remained silent for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, under their intense gazes, he responded in a calm tone, &#34;You can support me now, but can you continue to do so forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux was a globally renowned luxury brand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Marc had often complained about their strict quality requirements, the substantial payments they made were beneficial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The five-year contract with Elite Lux had been reassuring. If Marc terminated it prematurely and Daniela chose another supplier, would he not become merely a tool in their hands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett observed Marc reflecting, a smirk of ridicule crossing his face briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second later, he sighed again. &#34;Alright, Marc, I understand. We shouldn&#39;t pressure you like this. Let&#39;s pretend we never had this discussion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s act of swallowing his pride left a faint sense of guilt hanging in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone said, &#34;Marc, I hear you have a five-year deal with Daniela. It&#39;s just for five years,right? Why don&#39;t you show us the contract? Whatever she&#39;s buying, we can take it off your hands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion ignited excitement among the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With some hesitation, Marc took out the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the room as they began to read through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, grinning mischievously, picked up the document. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? What&#39;s with the silence? Is it such a bigissue? It&#39;s only a five-year commitment...&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as hespoke, his smile gradually disappeared, and his face stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could no longer find humor in the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marc, are you serious? Is this the volume you supply to Elite Lux?&#34; &#34;Wait, is your entire company dependent on Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this even real? How are we supposed to handle such a large amount?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not fair,Marc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the quieter guys exchanged a glance with Hackett, then patted Marc on the shoulder. &#34;Marc, this isn&#39;t right. Remember when your daughter was kidnapped abroad? Hackett saved her. Without his help,who knows what might have happened? Now it&#39;s time for you to repay him, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc&#39;s stomach dropped at the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett dismissed it with an air of false humility.&#34;Oh,that was nothing significant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing?&#34; the other man retorted.&#34;Marc1Hackett saved your life. Now he&#39;s been offended, and you won&#39;t support him? Do you even belong to this association? Look, we&#39;re not abandoning you. We&#39;ll take twenty percent of the order. You figure out the rest. It&#39;ll work itself out, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Marc could respond, Hackett stood up. &#34;Thanks, Marc. Don&#39;t look so down. Daniela&#39;s big orders mean she depends on you, doesn&#39;t she? She won&#39;t dare upset you. Maybe she&#39;ll even beg you later. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc responded with a forced,bitter laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the trade association, he felt an overwhelming weight on his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The underlying message from everyone was clear: they wanted him to test the boundaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t comply, he risked being expelled from the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was reviewing documents in her office when Lillian knocked on the door. &#34;Daniela, Marc is here. He wants to meet with you.&#34;</p>
