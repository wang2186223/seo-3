                <p>Leaning forward slightly, the secretary spoke in a lowered voice. &#34;The buyer of that property-surname&#39;s Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;Are you talking about Daniela Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still cautious, the secretary replied, &#34;That&#39;s likely, sir,but all we were told was the surname. No full name was provided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Hamilton needed to hear. A bitter chuckle escaped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no way that&#39;s her. Come on, what would she want with a crumbling old building like that? You think she&#39;s suddenly planning to launch some kind of empire in Oiscoll? On my turf? That&#39;s just ridiculous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing the matter aside with a scoff, Hamilton waved a hand dismissively. &#34;Forget it. Go take care of dinner for tonight. I&#39;ve been a bit too harsh with both Daniela and Cedric lately. They&#39;re probably holding a grudge.Make something they like and smooth it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, that was more generosity than he&#39;d ever  offered before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still rooted in place, the secretary didn&#39;t budge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave him a pointed look &#34;What are you waiting for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering right away, the secretary glanced at his phone, checking something. A moment later,he said carefully, &#34;Daniela declined the dinner invitation&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked, surprised. &#34;Alright, if they can&#39;t come here, I&#39;ll go see them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had just taken a step forward when the secretary quickly added, &#34;She also mentioned that she won&#39;t be available to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about Hamilton&#39;s demeanor shifted in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, now they&#39;re just being childish,&#34; he snapped. The words were right at the edge of his tongue-he would cancel everything and let them stew in their own pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the secretary wasn&#39;t done. &#34;We just confirmed-the one who bought the property across from McCoy Group is Daniela. Without a doubt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s breath caught. His jaw dropped as the words sank in. &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary knew Hamilton had heard him and was  well aware of the anger he felt at the moment. He bowed his head and braced himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling me Daniela bought that building?&#34;Hamilton&#39;s voice dropped, dark and furious.&#34;What the hell does she want with real estate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than make assumptions, the secretary stayed quiet, lips pressed together tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silence didn&#39;t sit well with Hamilton. His stare turned cold.&#34;I said-speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous shudder ran through the secretary as he forced out the words. &#34;People think Daniela intends to expand Elite Lux here. Start her own enterprise in Oiscoll,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face tightened, the color draining from it.His mood soured instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, fury danced just below the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now she&#39;s declaring war on me?&#34; he yelled &#34;That&#39;s what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoulders hunched,the secretary gave a reluctant nod.&#34;That&#39;s how it looks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Hamilton slammed his cane against the edge of the table, sending crystal glasses crashing to the floor. &#34;This is madness! Go find out whether Daniela&#39;s really pulling out of Cedric&#39;s inheritance battle. Are they walking away from everything the McCoy family built?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the secretary could move, Hamilton shouted with a swift kick, &#34;Go! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrambling out the door, the secretary rushed to Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, he delivered the question as carefully as he could. &#34;Mr. McCoy asked why you purchased the building across from McCoy Group. Is this the start of something permanent here in Oiscoll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was cautious, but Daniela caught the meaning immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no hesitation, she replied, &#34;Tell Hamilton this-if anyone wants the McCoy fortune, they can have it.But if he expects Cedric to sit quietly and swallow his pride, then I&#39;ll be the first toraise hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer hit harder than the secretary expected.His head lifted, and for the first time, he truly looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living under Hamilton&#39;s control had crushed his pride for longer than he cared to admit. But now, watching someone stand up to Hamilton so boldly, it stirred something in him It thrilled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I relay that to Mr. McCoy as it is?&#34; the  secretary asked, still a bit hesitant. &#34;Does that mean you plan to bring Elite Lux to Oiscoll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the brand already established globally, it would have been the obvious move for someone like Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small,confident smile played on her lips. &#34;No. That would be too easy. I want to beat Hamilton in the one place he thinks he&#39;s unbeatable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word she spoke was meant to remind Hamilton that Cedric had more than just potential-he had her supporting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before walking away, the secretary stole one last look at Daniela. There she was-composed, fearless, the kind of woman people dreamed of becoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if envy had a name, it would&#39;ve been Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously, what kind of divine luck did he cash in on to end up with someone like her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the secretary was gone, Cedric looked over with a gentle smile meant only for her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in and rested his head against her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really spoil me,you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave him a sideways glance,half-exasperated &#34;Stop talking and eat your breakfast.&#34; Cedric considered teasing her, but the thought of getting kicked out sobered him up fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he dipped his head and let out a quiet laugh</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when Carol walked in, catching sight of his amused expression. &#34;Cedric, what&#39;s with that creepy little grin? You look like you&#39;re up to no good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s grin only grew wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to him, catching the light in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have to say anything to know it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She loved seeing Cedric&#39;s smile.</p>
