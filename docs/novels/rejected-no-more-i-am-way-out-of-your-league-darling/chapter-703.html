                <p>Cedric was in the garden, quietly tending to the flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them approached and stood in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up, surprised to see them there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need something?&#34; he asked. His voice was cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles froze for a moment. In that moment, he saw something familiar-Cedric looked just like Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stepped forward first, keeping his usual smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Charles McCoy, our brother. He heard about your injury. He works in the medical field and knows specialists who treat leg conditions. We&#39;re really grateful that you chose not to fight for the inheritance . To show our thanks, we&#39;ve already arranged for a doctor to take a look at your leg.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three believed Cedric would accept their offer without resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric didn&#39;t even look at them. &#34;Don&#39;t bother.I&#39;m not your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged uncertain glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stepped in. &#34;Even if you won&#39;t admit it, you&#39;re still our brother. You gave up your claim. Let us at least do something in return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen added quickly, &#34;If you refuse, we&#39;ll carry the guilt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles nodded several times. &#34;We should help you recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stopped watering the flowers and stared at them, his gaze sharp. &#34;Why are you being so kind all of a sudden? What are you really after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made all three chuckle nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas replied, &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? We just want to thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen jumped in. &#34;You&#39;ve treated us well. We want to give back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles said at once, &#34;Otherwise, we&#39;ll feel terrible.Please let us help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at them and said flatly,&#34;If you feel that guilty, should I change my mind and fight you for the inheritance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shut them up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s expression turned uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of something cold passed over Charles&#39;face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught all of it and let out a quiet laugh. &#34;I&#39;m not your brother. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t get anything.But if you&#39;re going to call me brother, then I deserve a share. Whether or not you mean it, that&#39;s something you&#39;ll have to think about.&#34; He turned back toward the flowers. &#34;And I know the state of my leg. If you&#39;re set on being helpful, go assist my wife. She still needs to figure out who wrote that note.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t want to waste another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They only cared about money and power-neither of which interested him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Cedric walked back toward the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles glanced at Nikolas and Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen caught up to Cedric and spoke quickly. &#34;We won&#39;t call you brother, but you should accept our goodwill. If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll be uneasy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you agree to let us help, we&#39;ll take it as a sign you won&#39;t fight us over the inheritance.&#34; Nikolas stepped in right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came to a halt. &#34;Why do you all care so much about my leg?&#34; Charles noticed the shift in his tone and said,&#34;Cedric, we&#39;re doing this for both you and us. You&#39;re a good-looking guy, but that leg messes with your image. Even a top executive needs to look the part,don&#39;t you think? And your wife-she&#39;s stunning.Wouldn&#39;t you want to dance with her on a clear,starry night? What if one day she walks away because of it? Wouldn&#39;t that make you want to come back and fight us for what we have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t reply right away. The thought struck something in him. He did want to dance with Daniela under the stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them picked up on his hesitation. But before any of them could say more, a voice drifted out from inside the villa.&#34;I don&#39;t like dancing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All three turned toward the sound, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas called out, &#34;Daniela, we&#39;re trying to talk some sense into Cedric. Can&#39;t you support us on this?Don&#39;t you want his leg to heal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen added, &#34;It&#39;s a shame to wear such a nice suit when the leg doesn&#39;t match it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles leaned forward, his voice smooth. &#34;Daniela,think about it. A bad leg doesn&#39;t just affect looks. It&#39;ll affect his health too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow tensed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three exchanged hopeful looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles knew not to push the wrong way in this situation. He softened his tone and smiled.&#34;What handwriting were you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen pulled out his phone and tapped the screen.&#34;Take a look at this. Do you recognize the writing?It looks familiar. I know l&#39;ve seen it before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles gave it a quick glance and shrugged.&#34;I don&#39;t recognize it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t leave him. She caught the slight shift in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure you don&#39;t recognize it?&#34; Daniela asked, her voice cold, eyes locked on his face.</p>
