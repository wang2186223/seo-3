                <p>Katrina couldn&#39;t contain her emotions any longer. She yanked Joyce outside, her temper flaring, &#34;Joyce, do you really intend to embarrass me like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s demeanor was unaffected. Her face showed no emotion, utterly impassive. &#34;Mom, I pleaded with you, yet you declined. You prioritized your own desires, neglecting mine. I had no choice but to depend on myself. Was | wrong? The reason I&#39;m here today is because of you. You&#39;re the one who should be reflecting on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina felt herself teetering on the edge of sanity. Her eyes bore into Joyce with a frosty intensity.. &#34;Leave Doug now! Return home, and you&#39;Il still be my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being your daughter means little to me at this point. What matters is preserving my integrity,&#34; Joyce responded indifferently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes welled up with tears. &#34;I put so much effort into raising you, and this is how you repay me?I promised I would find a way to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her sleek, designer dress, Joyce maintained her composure.&#34;Oh really? Your help involved letting someone attack me with a knife? You had an option but chose not to take it. I was forced to carve my own path.I stand by my actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rolled down Katrina&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, however, stayed unmoved. &#34;I see, Mom. Everyone looks out for their own interests. I understand. You weren&#39;t willing to make sacrifices for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina opened her mouth to respond, but Joyce cut her off.&#34;There&#39;s no need for further discussion.I&#39;ve made my choice. I&#39;ve never managed to make you proud. If you feel disgraced by me, then feel free to declare to the world that you don&#39;t have a daughter like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With these words, Joyce began to walk away. Katrina hugged herself tightly, shlvering as tears streamed down her face, watching Joyce&#39;s figure recode into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she realized she was on the verge of losing the daughter she had cherished all her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was well-known for his notorious sexual escapades. Despite Joyce&#39;s attendance at the event in a stunning gown, her attire revealed no skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rationale was clear to all present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the outward elegance lay a life filled with pain and sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon Katrina&#39;s return home, she found Daniela already there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in soft lighting, Daniela looked as radiant as ever.Cedric was there too, feeding her orange slices one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric murmured something quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him with a mix of surprise and curiosity, to which Cedric simply offered a reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the living room was warm and intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina lingered at the doorway, paralyzed, untilthe numbness in her feet jolted her back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter was enduring hardship. Why was Brylee&#39;s daughter being doted on by Olisvine&#39;s most distinguished man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Katrina not feel envious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not harbor resentment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not be seething with anger?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina&#39;s hands formed tight fists, Daniela seemed to finally notice her. Daniela glanced her way, her expression indifferent and almost dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment, she turned her attention away, completely ignoring the rage in Katrina&#39;s eyes. Katrina was seething with anger. Her fists tightly clenched, she approached Daniela. &#34;Is this your doing? Dld you orchestrate Joyce&#39;s marriage to Doug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reclined on the sofa, fixing Katrina with a cold stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, when confronted with accusations like this, she would simply respond, &#34;You&#39;re overthinking it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,today, when Katrina pressed her, Daniela chuckled briefly and asked, &#34;What if I did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold gaze slowly rose to meet Katrina&#39;s. &#34;What are you going to do about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Katrina was at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt an urge to lunge forward and strike Daniela. Yet, as her hand lifted, Cedric intercepted it and pushed it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina staggered and nearly toppled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Daniela&#39;s composedexpression, Katrina understood that this was Daniela&#39;s retribution for Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re trying to destroy me and Joyce. Daniela,you venomous snake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her eyes on the television, her face remaining stoic and detached. She did not even glance at Katrina again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina boiled with rage, yet she was powerless to act. Cedric&#39;s presence barred her from getting any closer to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, Daniela, just you wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was serene. &#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for this. Just don&#39;t keep me waiting too long.&#34;</p>
