                <p>Alexander&#39;s head jerked up in alarm upon hearing those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met Cedric&#39;s gaze firmly. Then, he attempted to see Daniela, but she was completely obscured by Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This unfamiliar sensation unsettled him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rough voice, he called out, &#34;Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called again, &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising his voice, he shouted, &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, there was no reply. And there never would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been emotionally distant, like a block of ice. No action of Alexander&#39;s could stir any reaction from her.She remained indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander realized it was futile. Daniela was unmoved by anything he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had openly admitted she did not understand love. She could not love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her responses were limited to polite apologies and logical rebuttals, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling heartbroken and defeated, Alexander abandoned the pretense he had maintained for so long, only to be met with acold &#34;Sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head, releasing a bitter chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up once more, his expression resumed its usual detachment. He turned to Cedric and spoke evenly. &#34;Cedric, do you see what I mean? How many years can you afford to waste on someone like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was not jealous but spoke with conviction.&#34;Your passion now will become a joke. Or perhaps it won&#39;t bother you. But Daniela is unchangeable.She&#39;s too cold. And why would you try? She grew up in a loveless environment, losing her mother early. How much genuine love can remain in her heart? Cedric,understand this: Daniela loves only herself. No one else matters. Do you see what I&#39;m saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been chasing Alexander for a decade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten whole years!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, her feelings never deepened. She simply went through the motions to marry him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Common belief held that the Bennetts were coerced into agreeing to the marriage by the overpowering influence of the Harpers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What remained unknown was that without his consent, the marriage would not have occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Alexander yelled, &#34;Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lightning flashed across the sky, thunder booming immediately after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice, deep and menacing, blended with the thunderstorm. His face contorted in rage, and his cry seemed almost cursed. &#34;You are destined to be alone and unloved forever! You have no heart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, lightning struck a massive tree outside,which then toppled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric quickly covered Daniela&#39;s ears as Alexander&#39;s furious voice escalated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dazed, Daniela looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thunder was overwhelming, and Cedric&#39;s hands firmly covered her ears, blocking out Alexander&#39;s tirade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the brief illumination, Daniela&#39;s gaze met Cedric&#39;s bright, unwavering eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be scared,&#34; Cedric whispered, his voice soft and soothing as a melody on a warm summer night,filled with promise. &#34;I&#39;ll never leave your side. You&#39;ll never be alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked slowly, meeting his gaze. Cedric reassured her, &#34;Do what makes you happy.Pursue what you enjoy. Love isn&#39;t crucial. Just focus on your happiness, and I&#39;ll handle everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the reflection in Cedric&#39;s eyes, Daniela saw herself.She blinked again and said, &#34;I feel as though I&#39;ve known you from a distant past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered her a tender smile, reserved only for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, he tapped her nose playfully. &#34;What&#39;s with the puzzled look? You&#39;re not as sharp as everyone thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious,Daniela tilted her head. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled, stood up straight, and gently tousled her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood a few steps away, observing their intimate exchange with fists tightly clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, he was consumed by rage and despair,eagerly awaiting the day Cedric would face disgrace and abandonment as he had. Alexander was convinced of one thing-Daniela was incapable of true love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, he addressed Katrina. &#34;I accept your proposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was visibly taken aback by his abrupt agreement. &#34;What?&#34; she gasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have one condition,&#34; Alexander stated, his voice as detached as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything!&#34; Katrina responded eagerly, nodding.&#34;Whatever you desire, I&#39;ll consent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina presumed Alexander would demand a portion of the Harper family&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Alexander, eyeing Daniela speaking with Cedric, declared, &#34;As Joyce&#39;s fiance, it&#39;s appropriate for me to move in early-to acclimate to married life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina beamed at the mention of &#34;fiance.&#34;&#34;Absolutely,&#34; she agreed cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face remained expressionless. &#34;Then kindly prepare a room adjacent to Cedric&#39;s. I&#39;ll be moving in tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was eager to personally witness Cedric&#39;s ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yearned to see if Cedric could withstand a decade of loving a woman who was incapable of returning his affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having stated his intentions, Alexander returned home to collect his belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, phone in hand, watched his resolute departure and tugged at Katrina&#39;s sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brimming with joy, Katrina exclaimed, &#34;Darling, did you hear? Alexander has agreed to marry you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s response was devoid of joy. &#34;But he never once looked at me when he proposed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze had been fixed on Daniela the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina brushed a strand of hair behind her ear and comforted Joyce.&#34;Marrying into the Bennett family is now your best course. Alexander is astute and capable. Your future is secure. He may seem distant,but your father and I are here to support you.Remember, men are straightforward beings. Don&#39;t emulate Daniela&#39;s stubbornness. There&#39;s a time to concede. Men inherently want to dominate in relationships, craving that control. It&#39;s essential to distinguish between being merely someone&#39;s partner and truly integrating into their life. Don&#39;t hesitate to fulfill his needs. Otherwise, he might seek them elsewhere. Men operate this way. You must learn how to appeal to him, how to captivate his heart.Daniela&#39;s inability to grasp this led to her failure.Take this as a lesson, okay?&#34;</p>
