                <p>As newfound wealth began to circulate, previously unattainable possibilities started to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander meticulously erased every shred of evidence linking him to his cosmetic surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then declared that Fairburne Group&#39;s vast resources would be rechanneled to support Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett Group, once teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, miraculously rebounded with the vigor of a phoenix ascending from its ashes. It soon became the crown jewel of Olisvine&#39;s business sphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the lucrative nature of the mining sector, it was a genuine fortune chest, promising colossal profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who, after all, could resist such a lucrative opportunity?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,having endured years of scorn and humiliation, savored his long-awaited return to prominence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes sparkled with unshed tears as he settled all of Bennett Group&#39;s debts, reclaimed the once-lost villa,and slipped back into his refined suits, restoring his status among the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Richard&#39;s haughty demeanor made a comeback, he maintained a courteous front around Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One afternoon, their paths crossed in a bustling shopping mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting her from afar, he approached with a warm, inviting smile. &#34;Daniela, it&#39;s been ages! If you&#39;re not too busy, perhaps you could come over for a chat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela strode away, Richard remained motionless, his gaze lingering on her with the warmth typically reserved for a father observing his son&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t solely Alexander who harbored regrets about their shared history. Richard too lamented his prior missteps with a heavy heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been a remarkable daughter-in-law, and their loss was due to their own misjudgments,Resolute in his determination, he vowed to value her presence if the opportunity for reconciliation ever arose. Moreover, Richard took deliberate steps to shield Daniela from any disparagement, making sure no one dared to speak ill of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his friends, picking up on his protective stance, joked, &#34;Richard, what&#39;s gotten into you? Trying to get back on Daniela&#39;s good side, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Richard replied, &#34;Daniela&#39;s a good girl and once my daughter-in-law. Now, with Bennett Group flourishing, it&#39;s hardly about getting back into favor. Times have changed, love is liberated, and modern relationships are fluid. Daniela held a deep affection for my son. If there&#39;s a path to them coming together again, it wouldn&#39;t be odd. She was once part of my family, and in my eyes, she always will be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words blended defensé, pride, and a renewed authenticity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His friends exchanged uncertain looks, wondering if Richard&#39;s comments were heartfelt or merely for appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Daniela truly have a change of heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would she remarry Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed,Daniela had once harbored affection for Alexander. Who could claim to understand the whims of a young woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of this, the Bennett family began to garner newfound respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several key clients, motivated by regard for Daniela, proposed exceptionally advantageous partnerships with Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elated, Richard phoned Alexander to relay the joyous developments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Alexander&#39;s response was devoid of enthusiasm. Instead, he responded,&#34;Dad, don&#39;t push too hard.Daniela treasures her privacy. If she learns of this, it won&#39;t sit well with her. And regarding those who seek partnerships because of her influence, we should decline them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard paused, torn between the allure of profitable deals and therisk of displeasing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his priority was clear-he could not bear the thought of causing her distress. Recognizing the vital role of patience, he consented and commenced a meticulous search for suitable collaborators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This decision only stoked the fires of rumor. The people grew increasingly convinced that Daniela had indeed reconciled with the Bennett family. After all, why else would they have spurned such lucrative offers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently,proposals for partnerships flooded in, one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a brief period, Bennett Group evolved from a struggling entity into one of the nation&#39;s most distinguished enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nevertheless, the public&#39;s curiosity remained piqued. Why had Alexander kept such a low profile for so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knack for business was indisputable. Under his stewardship, Fairburne Group had soared, securing its position as a frontrunner in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously,Doug had been too engrossed in his indulgences to helm the business effectively, while Joyce simply lacked the necessary acumen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, when Fairburne Group published its latest quarterly report, it quelled any skepticism regarding Alexander&#39;s prowess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the internal machinery running smoothly, Alexander organized a charity auction and extended an invite to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, behind the curtains, he masterminded a delay for Cedric&#39;s car, guaranteeing his late arrival at the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lurking in the shadows, Alexander observed Daniela&#39;s face, his fists slowly unclenching after being tightly bound in tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, a wave of satisfaction washed over him, confirming that his efforts had indeed paid off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, he trailed her, choosing not to reveal himself. Instead, he settled into a seat just behind her, his eyes locked onto her with a fervor that teetered on the edge of fixation. Every time Daniela lifted her paddle only to lose the bid on an item, Alexander stepped in, securing the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathered crowd glanced back at the mysterious, masked figure, murmuring to each other in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Daniela remained oblivious to the murmurs, her attention glued to her phone as she texted Cedric. She would occasionally participate in the auction before diving back into her conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his spot, Alexander caught glimpses of her cheek and the subtle smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept onto his face as well. He was utterly engrossed, following her every action with a fervor that came dangerously close to obsession. To him, it seemed impossible to divert his gaze, even for a fleeting moment.</p>
