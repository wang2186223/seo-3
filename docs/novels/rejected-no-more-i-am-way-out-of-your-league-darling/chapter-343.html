                <p>That evening, there was a department gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was present, accompanied by Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the event, Elyse was undeniably the center of attention, radiating vitality and charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her relationship with Daniela was well-known,ensuring she was treated with deference. Toasts made in Daniela&#39;s honor invariably included compliments for Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening progressed, Elyse approached Daniela,smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, you&#39;ve truly excelled. I&#39;m so proud of you1.1bet your mother is too, watching over you with joy.We used to talk about everything.I promised her that if she ever had a daughter, I&#39;d cherish her as my own.Sadly, I didn&#39;t keep that promise. Your hardships in the Harper family were unbearable, and | was helpless to intervene.&#34; Elyse&#39;s eyes welled up as she recounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, searching Daniela&#39;s face for any sign of emotion, but finding none, she embraced her. &#34;My dear,you seem so much more reserved now. It&#39;s my fault. Please, if anything is bothering you,you must share it with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela distanced herself from Elyse, her response detached. &#34;Nothing is troubling me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse accepted this, nodding. &#34;You&#39;ve always been perceptive, even as a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drying her tears, she leaned closer, lowering her voice. &#34;What are your thoughts regarding that woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which woman?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina,&#34; Elyse answered. &#34;Be cautious around her;she&#39;s shrewd. Your parents had a wonderful marriage until she came along. I suspect she played a role in  mother&#39;s tragic death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela played idly with her wine glass, her voice casual.&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Elyse insisted, her tone filled with conviction. &#34;I often visited your home back then.I witnessed your father growing close to her in the villa. Had it not been out of concern for your mother&#39;s feelings, I would have exposed their affair much earlier. And sure enough, after your mother died, Katrina assumed her place. It&#39;s too coincidental to be innocent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Daniela&#39;s laughter was sharp and cold. &#34;Aunt Elyse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; Elyse answered, but Daniela didn&#39;t speak for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked up abruptly, meeting Daniela&#39;s indifferent gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an unmistakable distance to Daniela,something Elyse couldn&#39;t quite connect with.  As Elyse was about to say more, Daniela spoke evenly. &#34;Three years ago, before my marriage to Alexander, I asked you a question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Elyse&#39;s smile vanished, her face suddenly tense. She stuttered, &#34;Did you? What was it that you asked?&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of recollection crossed Elyse&#39;s features, her complexion turning ashen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied, &#34;I asked whether Katrina had an inappropriate relationship with my father and if her involvement had anything to do with my mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, Elyse had dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand, saying, &#34;Impossible! Your mother was a business genius. What harm could Katrina, just a maid, do to her? It was purely an accident. Don&#39;t dwell on it. Let the past stay in the past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela vividly recalled Elyse&#39;s dismissive gesture from that conversation.Elyse had been so certain back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was one of the very few Daniela had truly trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Elyse&#39;s words were at odds with her previous assurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression momentarily tensed but quickly smoothed over. &#34;You were on theverge of marrying Alexander at that time. I feared revealing more might disrupt your plans. Besides, given your circumstances then, I wanted to protect you from potential harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly crafted a plausible explanation, aligning her reasoning neatly. &#34;Now, however, your circumstances have changed.You wield more power,and I believe you deserve the truth. Daniela, surely you don&#39;t hold my earliersilence against me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze dropped to her wine glass as she murmured, &#34;No, I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew you&#39;d understand. As your mother&#39;s cousin, my loyalty to you is unwavering. Daniela, you must recognize the danger Katrina poses and address it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a sip from her glass and rose. &#34;I&#39;m feeling rather weary. Aunt Elyse, I&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse watched Daniela departure, shaking her head slightly before seamlessly blending back into the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Lillian turned to Daniela and commented,&#34;I think your aunt has a point. Katrina is a problem.Why not take care of her sooner rather than waiting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, seated in the back, observed the passing scenery, her eyes gradually narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the day Katrina was discharged from the hospital,Daniela was just leaving her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! Your reckoning will come soon enough!&#34;</p>
