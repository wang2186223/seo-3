                <p>Lillian narrowed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone in a powerful position, being the subject of rumors was a matter Cedric would have to take seriously, even if he was broad-minded and not easily angered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While business success depends on capability, the image of those in power plays a crucial role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, why do so many CEOs go to great lengths to project an image of a perfect family life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stable public image is key to gaining investors&#39; trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric understood this basic truth better than anyone. Yet, he let the gossip about him spread without doing anything to stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either Cedric was exactly what the rumors suggested, or...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gaze fell on Daniela, who was smiling. &#34;Cedric, do you not care, or is it because you value Daniela&#39;s happiness over your own image and choose not to intervene?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she finished speaking, Lillian noticed Daniela&#39;s and Cedric&#39;s eyes meet from across the crowd,followed by a shared smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something wasn&#39;t right!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be more to it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless they were very close, there couldn&#39;t be such a lingering, meaningful exchange of glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s curiosity was piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed Daniela and pulled her into the courtyard. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s really going on between you and Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been enjoying the conversation inside, where they were discussing Cedric being caught in a compromising situation, when Lilian abruptly dragged her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt a twinge of regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve heard it all-Cedric likes men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>°Stop with the nonsénse. I don&#39;t believe it. Cedric is so traditional; he&#39;s only ever had eyes for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then what do you want to ask me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your relationship? Are you and Cedric together? Is there something between you two...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian was about to get to the heart of it, the driver called to inform her there was an issue with the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian urged, &#34;Don&#39;t think you can run off, Daniela. Stay here. I&#39;ll be back. Don&#39;t try to deceive me.&#34; With that,she stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle and settled onto a nearby bench to wait for Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What no one noticed was that someone had been observing from the balcony upstairs the entire time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Alexander, silent and unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith approached Alexander and peered down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw Daniela sitting gracefully on the bench, her long dress flowing elegantly around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to admit, even just sitting there, Daniela radiates the elegance of an aristocratic lady. She might lack theharshness of someone ín charge, but her charm is undeniable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he spoke, Keith felt a sharp, icy gaze cutting through him from beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean it like that. I was just admiring her. What&#39;s that supposed to mean, Alexandér? You&#39;re married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What does Daniela have to do with you? Even if I do like her, what&#39;s the harm in that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s cold gaze swept over him. &#34;How dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith laughed. &#34;What? Do you still have feelings for her?&#34; &#34;Isn&#39;t it normal for me to have feelings?&#34; Alexander replied, taking a sip of his drink, his eyes fixed on Daniela, &#34;She&#39;s my ex-wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith let out a short chuckle. &#34;The way you&#39;re talking, it&#39;s like she&#39;s still your wife, not your ex. But then again, who wouldn&#39;t be drawn to someone like Daniela? If you&#39;re serious about it, you&#39;d better make a move before someone else does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander raised an eyebrow, his curiosity gettíng the better of him. &#34;What exactly are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone used to believe Daniela and Cedric were a couple. So even if they had feelings for her, they didn&#39;t dare approach Daniela. But now that it&#39;s clear Cedric prefers men, the chance is wide open. Now everyone&#39;s itching to make their move. Even if they&#39;re not genuinely interested in her, chasing after Daniela&#39;s fortune is hardly a poor choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Alexander&#39;s fingers tightened around his glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to reply, he noticed two men with drinks heading in Daniela&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression hardened, and without another thought, he made his way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce made her entrance, fashionably late, just in time to witness the whole scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina leaned in and whispered to her, &#34;After all this time, you still haven&#39;t won over Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her teeth in frustration. &#34;He doesn&#39;t have feelings for me. He doesn&#39;t like me. What am I supposed to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hesitated, then spoke. &#34;If you really can&#39;t keep a man&#39;s heart, you&#39;ll have to learn how to make the best of your circumstances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned her head sharply, her eyes cold and calculating.&#34;You mean...?&#34;</p>
