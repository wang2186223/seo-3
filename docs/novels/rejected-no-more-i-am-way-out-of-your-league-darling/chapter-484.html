                <p>The event organizers had originally placed Daniela&#39;s seat next to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia approached Daniela and asked, &#34;Ms. Harper,apologies, but you&#39;re in my spot. Could you find another seat,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of cameras clicking filled the air as reporters rushed to capture the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes then turned to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was eager to see if Daniela would confront the daring woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Daniela remained perfectly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced over at Cedric, their eyes locked briefly,and she offered a subtle smile before saying, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Daniela headed to the back of the room and settled into the last open seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event staff scrambled in disarray, while Cedric maintained a grim look throughout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lydia,watching with a flirty smile, teased Cedric, &#34;Mr.Phillips, if you invited me to stir jealousy, that look won&#39;t help. We should appear closer, more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ffetn The mysterious, fleeting expression on Daniela&#39;s face earlier in the light lingered in Cedric&#39;s mind,refusing to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed Daniela had no feelings for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not at all!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed indifferent to him bringing another woman to the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he truly mean to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a casual fling, without any real meaning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger brewed inside Cedric, his focus far from Lydia&#39;s subtle flirtations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lillian, seated at the back, was fuming.&#34;Daniela! I&#39;ve said it before-Cedric isn&#39;t worth your time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hand, hanging by her side, shook uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lighting at the auction masked her expression.Despite taking several deep breaths, her anxiety persisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Daniela exhaled deeply. She retrieved a pill from her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing this, Lillian turned and held Daniela&#39;s hand down. &#34;Don&#39;t take it now. If you do,you&#39;ll have to begin all over.&#34; In the front row. Lydia rested her head on Cedric&#39;s shoulder, then shifted closer, their faces nearly touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela managed a weak smile and said to Lillian, &#34;If I don&#39;t take this, I won&#39;t make it through the night here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian slowly loosened her hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swallowed the pill with calm indifference.letting the wine wash it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows, a pair of ominous eyes observed every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the event, Daniela&#39;s chest tightened.She impulsively placed a bid on an item and whispered to Lillian, &#34;I don&#39;t feel well. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian agreed, and with Daniela, they both stood up to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Daniela turned and stole a glance at Cedric in the front row, subtly lowering her eyelashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she raised her eyes, Cedric coincidentally looked back, and their gazes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face lit up with a sincere, effortless smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, she mouthed to Cedric, &#34;I&#39;m leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly walked over to the heavy wooden door and disappeared behind it. Cedric stood up abruptly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Lydia asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook off Lydia&#39;s hand, a wave of panic washing over him as he darted outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,when he reached the door, it was empty;no one was in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was the stream of passing cars.Standing at the hotel entrance,he gave himself a hard slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips,&#34; called out the secretary, rushing after him. &#34;What are you doing out here? They&#39;re waiting for your speech inside. Come on, we need to get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling hollow,Cedric lingered at the doorway,his pause prolonged by the distant voices filtering out from the venue. &#34;Next, please welcome Mr. Phillips to present the most significant auction item of the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Phillips? Mr.Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, grabbing Cedric&#39;s arm,hurried him back inside. As they reentered, Cedric glanced back one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the night lay dark and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t head home; she went back to Elite Lux instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Lillian asked. Daniela shook her head. &#34;Just a bit down. It&#39;s normal -just side effects from the medication. I&#39;m okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was visibly upset. &#34;Divorce Cedric! What a jerk!Is it just because you didn&#39;t tell him everything? Does it really need to be this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slumped back on the couch, drained. &#34;Let&#39;s see.If...”&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struggled to finish what she was trying to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memories of their closeness haunted her. How could she just let go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some time, Daniela seemed to be reasoning wvith herself or perhaps reassuring Lillian. &#34;It shouldn&#39;t have been made public. That way, he&#39;d have more options going forward. Back then, I acted without thinking.I assumed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela left her thoughts hanging. She walked over to the refrigerator, grabbed a beer, and gulped it down in one swift motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, fuming with anger, pressed her. &#34;What were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reached for another beer. &#34;I thought he&#39;d have no regrets. I didn&#39;t ponder it too deeply. Honestly, I always knew he was stubborn. He wouldn&#39;t being willing to remain in the dark forever. That&#39;s why i kept my marriage to Cedric to myself for so long.&#34;  upset Cedric, nor did she want him to go unrecognized and unacknowledged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,he still ended up getting hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t believe it. &#34;Who do you think is really suffering in all this? Don&#39;t you ever think about yourself? If you get divorced and remarried, it would be your third marriage. Doesn&#39;t that embarrass you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed it off. &#34;Is it really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shouldn&#39;t happen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If things don&#39;t work out this time, she&#39;s determined not to marry again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t say any of these thoughts aloud.Instead.she kept drinking with Lilian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian could usually handle her drink well,but even she couldn&#39;t keep up with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dawn was about to break, Lillian slumped over,having drunkenly passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, still feeling uneasy, took a bottle and made her way to the rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chapter 479 | Am Yours</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Competing was never really Daniela&#39;s thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric indeed harbored other intentions..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s grip on the wine bottle grew unsteady,her hand shaking increasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She decided to place it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Atop the rooftop, the wind howled fiercely as it rushed past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes, focusing on the sounds and sensations around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the wind pushed the rooftop door open with a squeak, Daniela spun around to see a silhouette outlined against the faint light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up, her eyes gleaming like luminous pearls in the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure slowly approached, getting closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The darkest moments come right before the break of dawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clouded by medication and alcohol, Daniela&#39;s thoughts were foggy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she smiled,observing the familiar figure advancing towards her,step by step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure stood outlined in the light, creating a dark silhouette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a deep, echoing voice, he answered, &#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the man lifted his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Daniela&#39;s face froze,losing its warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused and disoriented, she asked, &#34;Is that you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to raise her hand when a pair of large hands covered her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am.&#34; The voice was deep and identical to Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately,Daniela sensed his breath drawing nearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood still for a moment, before quickly taking two steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, her vision was still covered by those large hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man asked, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt his intense gaze fixed on her lips. In her confusion,he moved closer still. &#34;I am Cedric. Will youpush me away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his breath tickled her lips, Daniela&#39;s expression turned into a frown and she stepped back once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Daniela brushed away the hands covering her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was met with a face that mirrored Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Don&#39;t want me to kiss you?&#34; the man asked, his eyes locked on her. His tone, carrying a trace of a smile, was just as familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Daniela asked, her voice steady and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric.&#34; The man opposite her hesitated, then straightened up. &#34;I am Cedric. Are you actually upset with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, her retreat was much quicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched the man in front of her with careful attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, she reminded herself that he looked strikingly similar to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were with Joyce at the last banquet. Who are you,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s smile turned sinister in the shadows. &#34;I am Cedric, the man of your desires. Aren&#39;t you exhausted of the old Cedric? You believe he doesn&#39;t get you. You feel he forces you to say things you don&#39;t wish to.You see him as cold and indifferent. Daniela, I am the new Cedric. I will always submit to you and loyally remain at your side. I will become whoever you need me to be. Isn&#39;t that better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head firmly. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man suddenly froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, No,&#34; Daniela repeated. &#34;I love Cedric, no matter his flaws. I don&#39;t care if he loves someone else.Whatever he chooses. I support him. His happiness matters more to me than my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the darkness, the man&#39;s brows furrowed deeply.&#34;What about me? Don&#39;t you want me? Daniela, if you wish,I am yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice held the seductive whisper of a lover.enchanting its spell in Daniela&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head and shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened her eyes again, she saw that the rooftop was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the lingering chill of the wind remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood still,puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the rooftop door swung open, and Lillian stepped through, rubbing her eyes. &#34;Daniela, why are you out here? Isn&#39;t it cold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Did you see anyone on your way un just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chapter 480 An Unexpected Twist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian shook her head. &#34;No. Who do you think made it up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze intensified against the biting wind as she responded, &#34;The person who looks a lot like Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian hesitated and then questioned, &#34;Could you have been mistaken? There&#39;s only one way up to the rooftop. I didn&#39;t see anyone coming down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave no reply. Her eyes swept across the empty rooftop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head back inside,&#34; Lillian suggested, noticing the biting cold. &#34;It&#39;s too cold up here; we shouldn&#39;t risk catching a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a slight nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to the elevator and descended back to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, Lillian immediately called a doctor to examine Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the doctor arrived, he was spotted by Linden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a furrowed brow, Linden confronted Lilian.annovance evident in his voice. &#34;Why wasn&#39;t informed that Daniela is ill? I&#39;m also a doctor, freshly certified at that. Don&#39;t you think I&#39;m capable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian presented the doctor&#39;s credentials, halting Lindenfor a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nudged Linden aside. &#34;Please,stay out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen in place, Linden was awe-struck. The doctor treating Daniela was none other than Lee Hoffman,his long-admired idol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden tried to follow, but Lillian halted him with a raised hand at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice betrayed his hurt feelings. &#34;Was everything you said about me being Daniela&#39;s family doctor just a lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood with her arms crossed, her face giving nothing away. Her expression was somber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden looked at her, a mix of fear and confusion in his eyes. &#34;Mustn&#39;t it be incredibly expensive to have Lee treat her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s response was emotionless. &#34;There&#39;s no charge.Daniela and Lee are close friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s eyes widened with astonishment. &#34;She&#39;s truly remarkable!&#34; His admiration was more heartfelt than ever before. He hesitated briefly before asking, &#34;What exactly is troubling Daniela? What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always thought of Daniela as strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was active, running and exercising daily.seemingly the picture of health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden posed his question with a casual smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Lillian was glaring at him with a look that could kill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scared, Linden asked. &#34;What&#39;s the issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian averted her eyes. &#34;Just a reminder-there are things you&#39;re meant to know and will learn in time.But prying into forbidden knowledge could prove catastrophic for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden let out a nervous chuckle. &#34;Catastrophic? What are you suggesting, that you might kill me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter became more forced as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the hallway fell into an unsettling silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden was confronted with Lillian&#39;s cold,menacing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Interested in testing your limits?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden felt his heart miss a beat. He faltered before responding, &#34;Test what exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Facing death. That&#39;s what you seem to be inviting.&#34; Lillian said sharply, her usual hint of a smile completely absent.Fear clutched at Linden&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, Linden realized Daniela and her group were not the easy marks like Elyse or Natalie, who could be easily manipulated. These were not individuals to trifle with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swiftly touching his nose, Linden made a quick exit from the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the treatment room, Lee was attending to Daniela. &#34;You&#39;ve been well for so long.What went wrong today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a rueful smile, Daniela replied, &#34;Just an unexpected twist,nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lee&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;You&#39;ve been off your meds for a while now; such occurrences are unusual.Remember,medication has its side effects; it&#39;s detrimental over time. You musttake better care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged with a nod. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lee continued, &#34;You only took a little medication this time, but next time, don&#39;t let your emotions spiral.Otherwise, you might need continuous treatment,which would severely impact your health. You&#39;re aware of the risks, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the room, Lillian listened intently to  Lee&#39;s  advice, her expression darkening, shadowed like the night.</p>
