                <p>Joyce chuckled over the phone. &#34;Doug&#39;s back, so l don&#39;t have time for you lately. But hey, if you send me a nude photo, it might brighten my day. I&#39;ll call you once I have a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t naive. He understood exactly what she was up to-she wanted leverage over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not,&#34; he shot back instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Suit yourself,&#34; Joyce replied with a teasing laugh. &#34;If I don&#39;t get that photo in five minutes, I&#39;ll move on to something else. The choice is yours. Alexander, have you still not grasped the situation? You&#39;re the one who dialed my number, practically begging me,remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, the line went dead with a sharp click. Standing on the balcony, Alexander felt a cold dread creep over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A million! It was just a million! Did it really have to come to this? The idea of taking such a photo made his skin crawl. What if it leaked? How could he ever hold his head high again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, desperation drowned out his hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his pride in shambles, he snapped the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within five minutes, the photo was sent, and the money hit his account instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Alexander&#39;s eyes, smudging the numbers glowing on his phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the money was transferred, the partnership was finally sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deal turned out to be highly profitable, with the other party already making an advance payment of five million. Looking at the money, Alexander felt a mix of emotions. This was what his dignity had cost him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A month later, the project was running smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the meantime, Alexander managed to land a municipal contract, offering Bennett Group a temporary lifeline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, at the celebratory dinner, just as Alexander was preparing to move ahead with renewed determination, a message from Joyce popped up on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a single word-just an image of an opulent hotel suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was clear without needing an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile faltered, and the wine he sipped suddenly tasted like acrid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned home, collected his belongings, and got ready to head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard sat on the sofa, his eyes fixed on Alexander  as he came down the stairs. He could already guess what Alexander was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who was once the pride of the family had fallen so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was overwhelmed with sadness but still held on to a tiny shred of hope. &#34;Can&#39;t we just give the money back to Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t work,&#34; Alexander answered in a steady tone.&#34;She&#39;s not after the money. What she wants is a way to release all the coldness I once showed her. She needs someone to bear the weight of everything she suffers with Doug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a price that money couldn&#39;t cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That photo request back then? It was all for this moment-when she could manipulate him without uttering a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander spoke no more and walked out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I&#39;m sorry,&#34; Richard said, his voice heavy with regret. &#34;It&#39;s on me for being so hard on Daniela back then. If I hadn&#39;t, she wouldn&#39;t have left you.She&#39;s not the type to turn her back on old bonds.I was wrong. I destroyed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was far too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could be undone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander reached for the doorknob, turned it, and left without a glance behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hotel, he hesitated briefly at the door before entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Joyce was already waiting. Dressed in a sheer silk nightgown that shimmered under the light, she moved with effortless grace, pouring herself a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made it,&#34; she remarked nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a small nod, took a seat across from her,and slid a check across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced at the figure-it matched exactly what she had sent him before. &#34;And what&#39;s this supposed to mean?&#34; she questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You gave me the money before. I&#39;m paying it back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t need the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware,&#34; Alexander replied, his expression unchanging as he set a bag containing specific clothing on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced at it, her smile growing broader.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m willing to be with you for one night, but just that -afterward,we&#39;re square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce took another swirl of her wine and laughed again. &#34;That wasn&#39;t the deal, was it? You need to realize, Alexander, that the terms and how long this lasts are in my hands now. You never seem to grasp your place. But it&#39;s fine. This time, I&#39;ll let you have your way. One night&#39;s not enough. How about a whole day and night instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander clenched his jaw, his face tightening with  tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chuckled, clearly enjoying the sight of him. &#34;I just love this look on your face-swallowing your pride, yet with no option but to give in. A full day and night is the least I&#39;ll accept. If you don&#39;t agree,you&#39;re free to walk away right now. But don&#39;t complain when I get ruthless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander stared at her assured expression, his hatred burned, but there was no escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The business he had fought so hard to build had to be preserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t let go of the Bennett family&#39;s legacy,something that had stood for over a century.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was certain Alexander would comply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on some classical music and stepped into the bathroom for a bath, leaving the door ajar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From there, she had a perfect view of Alexander&#39;s inner turmoil and slow unraveling.  Joyce couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she had chosen Doug, she hadn&#39;t felt much different from how Alexander felt now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was just how people were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once there was a first compromise, there would be a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time she gave in, it made it easier, and soon the struggle was forgotten, becoming something she just accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the discomfort was only temporary, but the happiness that money brought lasted forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smiled as she watched Alexander get up from his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he started to take off his clothes, one piece at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange, considering she and Alexander had only been together once before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t particularly memorable, especially when compared to Doug&#39;s rough ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce was thrilled by the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t in love with Alexander; it was about her pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t Alexander look down on her when they married?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing him kneeling before her, kissing her feet,Joyce&#39;s face twisted with satisfaction.</p>
