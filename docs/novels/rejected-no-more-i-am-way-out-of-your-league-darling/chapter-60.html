                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a smile, and she was nearly out the door when the secretary darted forward, his gesture filled with urgency as though he was bursting to speak-only for Cedric&#39;s icy glare to silence him instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped his gaze and clamped his lips shut without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Daniela, his demeanor composed yet assertive. &#34;Forget everything else; breakfast first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dining table, Cedric and Daniela had breakfast silently. Nearby, the secretary lingered, his expression contorted with worry and indecision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting her gaze between Cedric and the secretary,Daniela probed, &#34;Is there something I should know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary glanced at Cedric, his eyes pleading</p>
                
                
                
                <p>for permission to disclose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Daniela placed her utensils down that the secretary gathered enough courage to speak,his words spilling out in a hurried flood. &#34;Ms. Harper,your father, along with Katrina, Joyce, and reporters from eight media companies, are waiting downstairs.They are adamant about meeting with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As this news settled, Daniela&#39;s smile waned ever so slightly. She reached for a napkin, dabbing at her lips thoughtfully, then turned to Cedric with a mischievous grin. &#34;Is this what&#39;s been troubling you all morning? You really do care too much. Rest assured,I can handle them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely audible hum rippled through Cedric&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the elevator carried them downwards, Daniela assumed Cedric would make his way back to his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first floor lobby was swarming with reporters,while the manager struggled valiantly to impose some semblance of order. Cedric took a decisive step forward. His countenance was shadowy and intense, mnirroring the ominous clouds of a gathering storm, and the loud hubbub promptly hushed to a whispoer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the Harper family appeared to diminish in his imposing presence. Heads dipped. The murmur of voices tapered off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained utterly wordless. The quiet he held spoke volumes on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poised protectively close to Daniela, with his hands relaxed in his pockets, his gaze sharply swept the crowd. His eyes, icy and penetrating, sliced through the crowd, challenging anyone bold enough to hold his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silent stance broadcast a stark warning-challenge her, and face the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Cedric&#39;s commitment to safeguard Daniela was public knowledge, witnessing his assertive protection firsthand was quite the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It radiated a fierce protectiveness laced with unshakable dominance-unyielding and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A palpable tension choked the air, causing everyone in his line of sight to gulp with apprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden felt a surge of panic. When the hell would Cedric stop clinging to Daniela like a damn parasite?His constant vigilance over her was throwing a wrench into their plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stepped back too. She was all too familiar with Cedric&#39;s persona-an untouchable tyrant with an ego to match, and absolutely no room for compromise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood his ground, a picture of tranquility yet undeniably commanding, his gaze downcast, his face a mask of inscrutability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dark circles under his eyes hinted at a lack of sleep, lending a sharpness to his features. Breaking the tense quiet, he finally spoke. &#34;You&#39;ve got something to say? Well, I&#39;m right here-spit it out already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was smooth, almost deceptively soft, as if he were consciously tempering his words to keep the peace. Yet, beneath his calm exterior, signs of fatigue and underlying irritation were palpable,straining the nerves of everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group opposite him paused, their anxious glances flickering from one face to another,none daring to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension build, Katrina leaned closer to Caiden and discreetly nudged his arm, her gesture a silent plea for him to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden cleared his throat nervously. &#34;Mr. Phillips, I noticed that today is Monday, and the financial news mentioned you&#39;re to finalize next year&#39;s contract with one of the world&#39;s top multinational corporations.You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he really meant to ask-but couldn&#39;t muster the boldness to state outright-was if Cedric was supposed to be on his way already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he framed it as an evasive, roundabout inquiry, hoping Cedric would pick up on the subtle cue. &#34;You&#39;re not on a tight schedule, by any chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, with his hands placed in the pockets of his sharp, tailored black suit, slightly tilted his head. His consistent choice of dark attire only served to deepen the formidable aura that clung to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the slightest flicker of a smirk was enough to snuff out any semblance of defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally spoke, his voice was deep and coarse, cutting through the thick air. &#34;Your concern is noted,Mr.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answer was concise-courteous, yet noncommittal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden suppressed his irritation, not daring to contest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the room thickened with tension, the silence so heavy that it felt almost suffocating.Eventually, Daniela shattered the quiet, addressing Cedric in a poised yet assertive tone. &#34;Everything&#39;s fine here. If you&#39;ve got other matters to deal with,don&#39;t worry about this-l&#39;ve got it covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric drew his hands from his pockets, his voice now soft and soothing, contrasting sharply with his earlier domineering presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No rush. The signing has been rescheduled for later this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, Katrina, and the assembled reporters all inhaled sharply in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This meeting was no ordinary affair-it was a crucial discussion about an international contract worth billions of dollars. And Cedric had rescheduled it as if it were a mere inconvenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very morning, a throng of media representatives and top-tier executives had converged outside the Phillips Group headquarters, all eager to witness the landmark signing of this colossal agreement. Yet now, Cedric had postponed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His boldness left everyone present utterly dumbfounded. Amid their astonishment, it became glaringly clear. Daniela held a place in his life so vital,no one could ever hope to fill it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gravity of this insight rendered the crowd deathly quiet, with nobody daring to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What seems to be the issue? Is it really that difficult to speak up?&#34; Cedric grasped a chair, scraping it across the floor with a grating sound, and took a seat near the security station. Propping his chin on his hand, he leaned forward with a challenging look.&#34;Look, I&#39;m merely here as an observer. Proceed and engage with the CEO of Elite Lux. Act as if I&#39;m not even here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped the lobby once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted them to ignore his presence? The notion seemed absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The icy, piercing sharpness of his stare was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless they suddenly went blind, ignoring Cedric&#39;s overbearing presence was completely out of the question.</p>
