                <p>Three months had passed when a stunning headline captured everyone&#39;s attention in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breaking News! Landmark of Olisvine Acquired by Mysterious Magnate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elite of the city were abuzz, their conversations brimming with intrigue and wild guesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe it? Someone is rich enough to snag Olisvine&#39;s iconic Luxor Tower!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t the owner, Cyrus Bradley, say it would be a wedding gift for his daughter? Why would he part with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Money speaks volumes, and everything comes with a price tag,&#34; Lucian Chavez, the CEO of a major hardware firm,remarked with a smirk, illustrating with a hand gesture. &#34;I&#39;ve heard the offer was so staggering that Cyrus couldn&#39;t refuse. The property was in someone else&#39;s hands the very next day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can&#39;t believe this!&#34;</p>

                <p>&#34;Money speaks volumes, and everything comes with a price tag,&#34; Lucian Chavez, the CEO of a major hardware firm,remarked with a smirk, illustrating with a hand gesture. &#34;I&#39;ve heard the offer was so staggering that Cyrus couldn&#39;t refuse.

                <p>A murmur of disbelief swept through the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can&#39;t believe this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he strode towards the door to take the call, it burst open unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold breeze swept past him, and the first thing he noticed was a dark, imposing figure entering the room.Looking up, Alexander realized the man was very tall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairs clattered against the floor as others stood hastily, their voices a mixture of awe and excitement.&#34;Mr. Phillips! Oh, what a pleasure to have you grace us with your presence!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding his phone with a firmer grip, Alexander stepped aside, yet his eyes remained momentarily fixed on the newcomer, whose chilling presence suggested a stern warning to those unacquainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming back to his senses, Alexander finally spoke into the phone. &#34;Dad, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s voice crackled with enthusiasm through the phone. &#34;Did you hear? The Luxor Tower has been bought by Elite Lux&#39;s president!&#34; His tone was low, as though he was wary of eavesdroppers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever heard of Elite Lux? It&#39;s the crown jewel among transnational design firms, with a valuation in the billions. Undeniably, they are the best of the best! Imagine the boundless opportunities if we could establish a connection with Elite Lux. Alexander,word has it that the president of Elite Lux will be visiting Luxor Tower tomorrow to review the renovations. I want you to bring our company&#39;s top-notch design portfolio and try to spark a partnership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if it doesn&#39;t result in a collaboration, just catching the eye of Elite Lux&#39;s CEO could unlock a lot of opportunities for us in the future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander promptly straightened his tie and inquired,&#34;Any chance you could figure out what that CEO might like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard replied, &#34;No, they keep a low profile. Nothing about them is publicly accessible. However, they might have a taste for exquisite liquors or high-end watches. An opulent gift should definitely leave the perfect impression.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to disconnect, Richard chimed in with an afterthought, &#34;Oh, and if it fits into your schedule, take Joyce along with you. Her boutique was a fixture in the Luxury Tower, but with the recent sale, she&#39;s been forced to vacate. The building is a landmark, after all, and she&#39;s understandably reluctant to leave it behind. From what I&#39;ve gathered, Caiden holds Joyce in high regard, almost as if she were his own kin. Should the Harper family&#39;s wealth indeed fall into her hands, I&#39;d see no issue with you pursuing her.Daniela has lost her relevance. It&#39;s time to sever ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hung in the air as Alexander stood motionless, his expression blank and his gaze cast downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s voice broke the silence. &#34;Keep in mind, 8 a.m.sharp tomorrow-bring Joyce along. And make sure to remind her to dress appropriately. No over-the-top outfits!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down,Alexander understood that Richard&#39;s view of Joyce was far from flattering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rural upbringing made her a stark contrast to those born with silver spoons in their mouths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Alexander&#39;s mind lingered on selecting a suitable and impressive gift for his secretary to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he arrived at the room, everyone was already clinking glasses with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving closer, the man beside him spoke in a hused tone. &#34;This guy&#39;s not one to mess with. Rumor has it,he just snagged the Skyline Tower right across from the Luxor Tower! Talk about a bold move. Looks like he&#39;s setting up to be neighbors with Elite Lux&#39;s CEO -what a powerhouse pairing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revelation forced Alexander to proceed with measured steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast a quick, cautious glance at Cedric, who,sensing the attention, locked eyes with him in a cold,piercing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander acknowledged him with a glass raised high,toasting to the ambitious newcomer from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,no sooner had he replaced his glass on the table than Cedric averted his eyes,ignoring Alexander for the remainder of the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man beside Alexander leaned in and asked, &#34;Have you somehow angered Mr. Phillips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head in response, his expression unchanging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man continued, &#34;You should tread carefully around him. He&#39;s not one to be trifled with-ruthless and decisive. The man possesses a remarkable shrewdness; crossing him could invite relentless retribution. Frightening thought,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spurred by the comment, Alexander&#39;s eyes flicked back to Cedric, seated calmly across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within their industry, a veneer of politeness was typically upheld; outright antagonism was a rarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Cedric exuded an aura of authority that was hard to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes lingered on Cedric, who checked his phone with practiced ease before standing with quiet authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing by Alexander, Cedric spoke quietly into the phone. &#34;What time should I pick you up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was casual, yet it carried a subtle undertone of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s sharp curiosity was instantly stirred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was this person that even the stoic man would make personal arrangements to fetch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, the voice responding on the other end of the call struck a chord of recognition in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a voice he was certain he had heard before.</p>
