                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart clenched with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rested against his shoulder, her exhaustion finally overcoming her as she drifted into a deep sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric carefully lifted her into the office&#39;s lounge.Outside, Lillian, sensing the quiet that had settled in,hesitated before quietly peeking through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was soft and cautious as she asked, &#34;ls she doing any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gently tucked a blanket around Daniela before quietly stepping out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they were outside the office, Lillian couldn&#39;t contain her anger any longer and exploded in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll kill Caiden! I&#39;ll make him pay! What kind of monster does that? He&#39;s her father! How could he hurt her like that? And now these rumors online,saying she&#39;s not Caiden&#39;s daughter? Otherwise,why would he treat her like this? I want answers too,damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she trailed behind Cedric, she couldn&#39;t hold back her frustration and shot him a barrage of questions.&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grim look, Cedric didn&#39;t respond and made his way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once there, he asked Josie for some ice cubes,then wrapped them carefully in a towel before heading back downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian slowly picked up on the dangerous vibe coming from Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her in that moment. While her words about killing Caiden were just heated talk, Cedric was a man of quiet action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped into Daniela&#39;s lounge, carefully pressing the ice against her swollen cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow tightened in sympathy, as though he were the one who had been hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood there and was about to speak when the secretary quietly entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a quick look at Daniela, who was asleep,before turning his attention to Lillian. &#34;Alexander Bennett wants to discuss something with Ms.Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian furrowed her brow in response. What could that bastard possibly want to talk about now, of all times? Was he trying to take advantage of Daniela&#39;s vulnerability?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, Lillian turned and snapped, &#34;Did he say what he wants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary noticed Cedric&#39;s stern expression and hesitated, unsure if speaking would provoke a harsh glare from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused,trying to gather his thoughts. Cedric, sensing the delay, turned his head sharply and demanded, &#34;What does he want to discuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stuttered, &#34;He said...he came to settle Joyce&#39;s store rent, and then...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the secretary could continue, a sudden chill swept through the air, affecting both Lillian and him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they pieced it together, Cedric had already stormed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His departing figure exuded a chilling, threatening energy, like someone consumed by rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was taken aback as Cedric appeared from Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric advanced, his expression dark and full of menace.&#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated and briefly looked towards Daniela&#39;s office, but Cedric moved to block his line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have some matters to discuss with Daniela. Didn&#39;t the secretary inform you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was icy. &#34;She&#39;s not available right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his many grievances and doubts, Alexander hesitated under Cedric&#39;s intense stare. &#34;Then I&#39;ll wait for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed as he spoke, his tone laden with authority. &#34;She isn&#39;t meeting with anyone today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was aware of why she was unavailable and responded calmly, &#34;I understand. That&#39;s why my father has invited her to dinner at our house today.I&#39;ll wait outside until she&#39;s free.&#34; He glanced at the time and added, &#34;There&#39;s still two hours left in the workday,so no need to rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary knew that in these situations,Cedric typically didn&#39;t say much. But today, things were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a low, commanding tone, Cedric repeated,&#34;I told you, Daniela isn&#39;t seeing anyone today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression tightened, and he squared his shoulders, meeting Cedric&#39;s gaze with a defiant stance. &#34;Do you think Daniela is your property?How can you make decisions for her without even consulting her? Sure, you might have influence now,but that doesn&#39;t mean everyone has to bow to your will. Daniela deserves the freedom to make her own choices. And just so you know, I&#39;m not here with any ulterior motives. I&#39;m just trying to offer some kindness. Her family dynamics aren&#39;t great, so I&#39;m doing what I can to help. I&#39;llpay for Joyce&#39;s rent.Daniela&#39;s upset, and I&#39;ve even had my family prepare a meal for her. What&#39;s wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words rang with a sense of self-righteousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian was about to respond, a flash of cold fury crossed Cedric&#39;s face, followed by the sharp crack of a fist striking something hard. The impact was deafening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stumbled backward, losing his balance before crashing to the floor in a clumsy heap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room stood frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Alexander seemed dazed by what had just happened. Wiping blood from the corner of his mouth, he rose to his feet, preparing to confront Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Ryan stepped out of the elevator,deliberately tripping Alexander, sending him crashing to the floor again, this time face down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Alexander tried to get up once more,but Cedric quickly stepped in front of Ryan, blocking his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pointed finger aimed at Alexander, Cedric growled, &#34;Try it, and you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s hand curled into a tight fist at his side,his fury evident.</p>
