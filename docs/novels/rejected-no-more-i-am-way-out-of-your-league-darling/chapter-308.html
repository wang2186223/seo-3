                <p>Daniela had found herself caught in a relentless whirlwind of work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her commitment to the headquarters left her no time to unwind or take a breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she returned home, it was often well past nine at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Cedric_usually picked her up, the demands of a large project at Phillips Group recently made Daniela insist that he meet her at home instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, just as Daniela got into the car, the driver glanced back. &#34;There&#39;s a car trailing us. I&#39;ve been noticing it for days. That car has been tailing us ever since we left the office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up from her tablet, Daniela replied, &#34;I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver asked cautiously, &#34;Should I get someone to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still focused on her tablet, Daniela answered, &#34;No need. They haven&#39;t made a move, just keeping their distance. If we take action now, we&#39;ll only alert them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver nodded firmly. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they pulled up to the Harper family villa, they saw Cedric arriving at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his way over to Daniela, his expression serious. &#34;You&#39;re aware a car&#39;s been tailing you,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;Did you notice it too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her smile, Cedric relaxed slightly, his posture shifting. &#34;Yeah, I was behind you. I saw that car follow you into the neighborhood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together,they walked into the house, and Daniela nodded. &#34;It&#39;s been going on for a few days now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face tightened with concern. &#34;Should I handle it?&#34; Bending down to swap her shoes, Daniela responded, &#34;There&#39;s no need. They&#39;re not posing any danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric fell quiet. He sensed that Daniela always had a plan. Her composed manner spoke volumes of her confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Cedric took her hand and said, &#34;I&#39;ve told you before, there are lines I won&#39;t cross. Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a curious glance, Cedric asked, &#34;And what exactly are those lines?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not allowing myself to get hurt,&#34; Daniela answered simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked with hers, and he asked again, &#34;You promised, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worry in Cedric&#39;s eyes was undeniable, a concern so palpable that Daniela couldn&#39;t dismiss it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been detached, indifferent to most things around her, keeping a distance from the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what happened, it never truly bothered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world kept turning whether she existed or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when she looked into Cedric&#39;s eyes, the anxiety she saw there caused a gentle, unexpected flutter in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression softened, and with a calm smile, she reassured him, &#34;Yes, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew that when Daniela gave her word, it was unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she made a promise, it was as good as done-there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight tension eased in Cedric&#39;s shoulders as he heard her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the high society they navigated, being followed was far from unusual, but it still stirred a protective unease in Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had been him being followed, he might not have cared as much. But when it came to Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t stand for any threat to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was everything to him, his entire world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone daring to harm her would have to face the full force of his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had already eaten at the office, and after a quick shower, they slipped into their familiar routine-relaxing together in front of the TV in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of their quiet evening, Joyce quickly passed through the living room, her head lowered, and dashed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes left the TV and followed her for a moment, moving towards the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment, Cedric turned his focus back to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce didn&#39;t return downstairs after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once in her room, she began typing out Daniela&#39;s detailed daily routes and schedule, sharing every little detail with Flash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand trembled as she pressed send.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear clung to her, but she couldn&#39;t pinpoint which terrified her more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flash,or Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease settled deep within her, making it impossible to shake off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long after midnight, Joyce decided to head downstairs for a drink. She flicked on the hallway light and made her way down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she reached for a bottle in the wine cabinet, a figure on the sofa caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Joyce placed her hand over her chest and moved closer to get a better look. &#34;Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Cedric sat in simple loungewear, his form illuminated by the moonlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow softened the usual sharpness of his features, making him appear unexpectedly gentle. With a nervous flutter in her chest, Joyce tightened her grip on the bottle and walked to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Struggling to sleep too?&#34; she asked, her shirt slipping slightly off her shoulder to reveal her smooth skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t acknowledge her. He remained still, and just as Joyce was about to step closer, his voice cut through the silence, cold and distant.</p>
