                <p>When Nikolas said Cedric was pathetic, Cedric remained indifferent, but Daniela&#39;s expression instantly turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who exactly are you calling pathetic?&#34; she spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wasn&#39;t a trace of warmth in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; pride was crushed in an instant by her question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You either do as told, or get out. That clear enough for you?&#34; Daniela rarely lost her temper, but when she did, her stern demeanor was downright intimidating, Even the housekeeper froze where she stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked there for a while now and had never once seen Daniela truly lose her temper-until now. In her eyes, Daniela had always been calm and friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she understood-Daniela&#39;s patience didn&#39;t extend to anything that involved Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper said nothing, but the moment settled into her memory like a warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his jaw, frustration all over his face.Cedric looked between the two of them, then walked over to Daniela. &#34;Why not let him stay? He does look kind of pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s company was finally gaining momentum,and having Nikolas loitering at their doorstep was inappropriate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged. &#34;If it works for you, keep him. If not, toss him out. Do whatever you think is best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, already fuming, didn&#39;t take that well.&#34;Seriously, Daniela? That&#39;s unfair! I just said something casually just now, and you act like you&#39;re ready to kill me. But Cedric? He can do whatever he wants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? Am I not allowed to be unfair? I&#39;m a human being, after all,&#34; she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw his hands up. &#34;Are you two just teaming up to mess with me now? Have you forgotten why I had to cut ties with my family in the first place? Do you think I&#39;d be here, taking this, if I had another option?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;And why exactly are you in this situation? Go ahead,tell us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made Cedric shift his gaze, fixing it on Nikolas with a stare that cut straight through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened. If he told the truth-that he&#39;d walked away from his family because he wanted to steal Daniela from Cedric, Cedric would beat him to a pulp and toss him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swallowed, his voice uneven. &#34;Why else? It&#39;s the inheritance. My dad made it clear I wasn&#39;t getting a thing, so l decided to develop my career on my own.&#34; Carol stood nearby, eyeing Nikolas from head to toe.&#34;Are you serious? Do you even have a thousand dollars right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab was brutal. She didn&#39;t need to say the rest.If he had money, maybe the arrogance would&#39;ve made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But without it? He should know where he stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gritted his teeth. &#34;I already walked away from the McCoy family. What else was I supposed to do?My father froze everything-my cards, my contacts.I&#39;m done explaining.&#34; He scanned the group around him. None of them looked easy to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of options, he turned to the one person who couldn&#39;t talk back. &#34;Show me to my room,&#34; he told the housekeeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked to Daniela for approval. A slight nod was all she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This way,&#34; the housekeeper said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing behind, Nikolas grumbled, &#34;I want a bigger room. One no one&#39;s ever stayed in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper answered politely, &#34;Of course. We have plenty. I&#39;ll help you choose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood improved slightly, but not for long. &#34;Make sure it has sunlight, a private bath, and a tub. Also, I want a fresh set of cotton pajamas. I&#39;m allergic to anything else. And I&#39;ll need red wine before bed-unopened bottle only.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded to everything-until the wine. Then she hesitated. &#34;We don&#39;t keep red wine in the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked like she&#39;d just spoken a foreign language. &#34;No wine? In a house this size?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, the housekeeper said, &#34;Should I ask Ms. Harper about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone was enough to kill his temper. He waved her off. &#34;Forget it. I wasn&#39;t that thirsty anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, Carol let out a laugh. &#34;This one&#39;s fun to watch. He&#39;s terrified of you, Daniela.&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t even glance his way. If he weren&#39;t Cedric&#39;s brother, she wouldn&#39;t have given him the time of day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper came back a moment later, clicking her tongue. &#34;He wants to soak in milk. Should I go out and buy some?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face darkened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a sigh. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to him. Just don&#39;t get upset.&#34; He headed toward the guest room before things got worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had picked one with massive windows.When Cedric knocked, he called out, &#34;You&#39;re not even staying that long. Do you really need all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, half-dressed, strolled out of the bathroom like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spun around, rolling his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re both guys,&#34; Nikolas said casually, toweling his hair. &#34;Why act like it&#39;s a big deal? Hey, check if the housekeeper&#39;s gone to buy the milk.&#34; Cedric&#39;s face said it all. &#34;If you&#39;re trying to end your life early, keep asking for nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked confused. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask Daniela to get it. I told the housekeeper. I&#39;ll borrow the cash from you.Chill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out a promissory note and handed it over like it was pocket change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric raised a brow. &#34;Half a million? For one night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not for a night,&#34; Nikolas scoffed. &#34;I&#39;m staying the whole month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric blinked. &#34;You&#39;re really testing my wife&#39;s limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes. &#34;I&#39;m your brother. I&#39;m paying rent. Do you still need her permission for such a trivial thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a tired sigh. &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
