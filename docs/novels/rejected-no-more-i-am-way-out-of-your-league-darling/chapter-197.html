                <p>Lillian stole a quick glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the brief flicker of emotion at first, Daniela&#39;s face became calm again. There was a coldness about her that felt almost icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, despite having no family of her own, couldn&#39;t help but feel a stab of pity for Daniela&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want Daniela to listen to another word of what was being said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to her feet, she hoped Daniela would take the hint and follow, but Daniela stayed rooted to her spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the discussion behind them carried on without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, what&#39;s your answer?&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice was steady, almost clinical. &#34;I&#39;m not asking for much. One  hundred million, and she&#39;s yours. After that, the Harper family and Daniela will have no further ties.How does that sound to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In families like theirs, even something as trivial as buying a pet could set them back millions, with upkeep easily climbing into the tens of millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Caiden, the offer was perfectly reasonable.&#34;That&#39;s my final offer. If you think it&#39;s too steep, I can always approach Alexander. I&#39;m confident he&#39;d pay even more to claim Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a slow sip of his coffee, exuding an air of composure that bordered on smugness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Cedric would surely pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela no longer considered him her father. She was divorced, yet Cedric continued to protect her, all while living under the Harper family&#39;s roof, bearing no title or official status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric not care about Daniela? Refuse to pay the hundred million? That was impossible! Daniela moved slightly, ready to intervene. But before she could act, a firm, calm voice sliced through the charged atmosphere of the cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pay the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela went rigid, her body frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spoke with an unshakable calm. &#34;Daniela is priceless. I hope that&#39;s clear. I&#39;ll offer you three hundred million-but there&#39;s one condition. You are never, for as long as you live, to tell Daniela what you just said to me. Never let her know you&#39;re aware all along that I was the boy from her past. Never let her find out that you&#39;ve watched her endure so much,indifferent to her pain. And don&#39;t you dare belittle the sacrifices she&#39;s made for Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s smile wavered for a fleeting second before returning, broader than ever. He let out a laugh and quipped, &#34;That&#39;s it? You&#39;ll still pay a bride price when you marry her later? So this isn&#39;t just a complete buyout,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face remained as composed as ever. &#34;No,  it&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his coffee cup down and leaned in, his voice low and icy. &#34;But you need to promise me-you&#39;ll take this secret with you to the grave. If Daniela ever hears a word of this, I won&#39;t demand my money back.Instead, I&#39;ll make sure you pay with your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight poured in through the cafe&#39;s windows,painting Cedric in a soft, golden light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric himself was the opposite of warm.An unyielding frost seemed to envelop him, his chiseled features and piercing eyes radiating a lethal intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Caiden felt a chill run down his spine as he realized he was treading on dangerous ground.The man sitting across from him wasn&#39;t just anyone-this was Cedric, a name that carried fear wherever it was spoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated, opening his mouth as if to defend his disgraceful actions or ease the tension. But Cedric cut him off. &#34;Leave.&#34; Caiden rose to his feet, an oddly cheerful grin on his face, as if Cedric&#39;s icy warning hadn&#39;t pierced him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three hundred million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure rang in his mind, sending a wave of satisfaction through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was more than enough to ensure his family could continue their extravagant lifestyle for years to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought that Daniela held such value in Cedric&#39;s eyes made Caiden chuckle quietly to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, a reckless idea suddenly darted through his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric could shell out three hundred million to keep Daniela in the dark about the past, then how much would Alexander fork over to hide the truth that he wasn&#39;t the boy from her childhood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better still, how much would Alexander be willing to offer to swap the bride in his forthcoming wedding-from Joyce to Daniela? The idea took hold of Caiden, and a wave of greed surged through every corner of his mind.</p>
