                <p>In the midst of the burgeoning Al project, Daniela was buried under an avalanche of work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Caiden stumbled upon her deep financial commitments while tuning into the evening news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the anchor relayed the staggering figures invested, a seed of resentment sprouted in Caiden&#39;s heart against Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, long after the witching hour, Caiden perched in the living room, awaiting Daniela&#39;s return. The moment she stepped through the door, his greeting sliced through the silence. &#34;Busy night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, noting his presence-a rare occurrence. A slight smile played on her lips.&#34;What an odd surprise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden detected the undertone of sarcasm and clenched his fists, only to relax them with effort and muster a smile. &#34;Odd? You&#39;re spouting nonsense. It&#39;s late. How about I whip up something for you to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Massaging her temples, Daniela sensed an ulterior motive.&#34;Cut to the chase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face felt slapped by her directness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he aimed for friendliness, her cold response stung him. He ruminated on the bitterness of nurturing such an ungrateful daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Caiden was cursing in his head, he forced a smile. &#34;Daniela, the news today mentioned your massive investment in that robotics venture. Billions, right? It&#39;s a bold stroke that even paints me in a good light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a slow sip of water, her eyes locking with his, awaiting the inevitable twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lacked subtlety; his intentions were plain for anyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela chose to feign ignorance, remaining silent for a few moments longer. Caiden blurted out, &#34;If you&#39;re pouring money into some speculative Al project, why not redirect some into Harper Group? It&#39;s our own company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m swamped,&#34; Daniela replied, her voice cold as she took another sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden struggled to mask his irritation, hls jaw tight as he tried to keep his smile. &#34;I get you&#39;re swamped. But consider this: you invest, and I&#39;H run the ship. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes gleamed with hopeful anticipation, hoping she would say okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Daniela&#39;s response was cutting. &#34;You think you can manage? Harper Group was once a titan here.Its decline under your watch isn&#39;t a mystery. I&#39;m biting my tongue now, so don&#39;t push me, or I might just spell it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clearly pointing to his failures at steering the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never truly desired the helm; the business bled money, and daily he was pecked at by Katrina and Joyce for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized, perhaps too late, that Brylee had been the backbone of their finances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought was discomforting, and he brushed it aside, fixing Daniela with a look of faint indignation.&#34;If you won&#39;t trust me, take the reins yourself. Throw billions at Harper Group like you did with that tech firm.I can&#39;t see why we can&#39;t resurrect it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his eyes darted to the staircase. He thought the gesture went unnoticed. But Daniela caught it instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning towards the stairs, she spotted two elongated shadows. Her smirk was frosty. &#34;Very well.If that&#39;s your wish, I have no objections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was taken aback by her swift acquiescence. After a pause, he asked in disbelief, &#34;You agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;I just said so.&#34; At that moment, the front door swung open, and Cedric entered, bringing a chill with him. His tense expression softened upon seeing Daniela.&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s unease intensified with Cedric&#39;s arrival, fearing a disruption to his plans. He rushed to continue,&#34;So,how much are you thinking of investing in Harper Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden noted Cedric positioning himself beside Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze fixed on her as if deciphering a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone remained composed. &#34;Whatever you deem necessary, I&#39;ll provide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s spirits soared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric added casually, &#34;And if that&#39;s insufficient, I&#39;ll contribute too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes sparkled with the prospect. It felt like an unexpected windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he spoke again, his voice quivered with excitement, his thoughts spiraling with endless possibilities.Fixing his eyes on Daniela, he said, &#34;Dear, not too much. A billion or so? Harper Group once stood as a colossus. A billion shouldn&#39;t be excessive,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A billion!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At present, both Caiden and the entire Harper Group wouldn&#39;t fetch nearly that if sold outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was essentially shooting for the stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,turnng to Cedric, Caiden said, &#34;We won&#39;t trouble you. My daughter can manage on her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that Caiden didn&#39;t desire Cedric&#39;s funds. His distrust for Cedric&#39;s cunning was simply greater,fearing a single false step could see him lose Harper Group entirely.</p>
