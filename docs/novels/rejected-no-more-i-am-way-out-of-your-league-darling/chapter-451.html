                <p>The voice on the other end of the call let out a low chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned at the sound. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s tone was light, almost amused. &#34;Oh, nothing.But I should probably tell you-Cedric&#39;s price is significantly higher than Daniela&#39;s. A hundred billion,non-negotiable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie almost choked on air,her mind struggling to process the number. &#34;Wait! What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell scratched his ear. &#34;Relax with the shouting.will you? It&#39;s a hundred billion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even realize that Daniela is the richest person on the planet? And she&#39;s only worth a billion. So tell me-why is Cedric priced at a hundred billion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By her estimation, based on Daniela&#39;s valuation,Cedric&#39;s worth shouldn&#39;t have been more than ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell chuckled again, his tone teasing. &#34;Oh? You really want to know why? Our boss is a woman, and Cedric? Well, he&#39;s ridiculously good-looking. To her,he&#39;s priceless.&#34; Natalie blinked at his answer, then clicked her tongue in mild disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had that much appeal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Cealmaur&#39;s leader was after him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched a brow. &#34;Wait, you&#39;re telling me your boss is actually a woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Obviously. What,do you have a problem with women in power? Aren&#39;t you a woman yourself? Anyway, do you have the money or not? Quit wasting my time with loose change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loose change?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had offered a billion. How was that considered nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then forget Cedric. Just take care of Daniela instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell&#39;s enthusiasm from earlier vanished, replaced by an indifferent tone. &#34;When will the money be ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hesitated before answering, &#34;A few days.I need to sell a villafirst,so you&#39;ll have to wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell let out a dry chuckle, the mockery in his voice nearly tangible. &#34;You&#39;re actually struggling to put together a billion? Call me when you have it.Bye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead, and all that remained was the  empty dial tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie sat in stunned silence, processing what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were people really that rich nowadays?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, she genuinely wondered if she was just too poor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her call ended, Daniela&#39;s phone rang. &#34;Daniela.Natalie has her sights on Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression darkened. Her voice turned ice-gold. &#34;She&#39;s asking for death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;Not that it matters.She couldn&#39;t afford the price, so she backed off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t convinced. &#34;She&#39;ll find another way.Have Shadow protect Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she added with finality, &#34;Starting today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell clicked his tongue. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s overkill? All this trouble just for Natalie? You really want to send our second-ranked assassin to guard him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first,of course, was Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Russell didn&#39;t question it. &#34;Got it!&#34; He turned and called for Shadow without hesitation. Lillian stood beside Daniela,her gaze drifting to Cedric in the distance.He was clearly irritated, barking orders as he arranged security. She couldn&#39;t help but comment, &#34;Daniela, are you sure this isn&#39;t overkill?Shadow hasn&#39;t been assigned to protection duty in years,and Natalie&#39;s hardly a real threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes lingered on Cedric, her expression softening, her voice quieter. &#34;You don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hurt him deeply once before. To her, he was beyond value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she was alive, she wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian tilted her head. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to step in? At this rate, Cedric looks like he&#39;s about to set up his own little registration desk for visitors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;He really isadorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian blinked, momentarily thrown off. Did love make people see the world this differently?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Cedric did exactly what Lillianhad predicted-he dragged a desk to the elevator and stationed himself there. Daniela, unfazed,pulled up a chair and joined him, soaking up the sun at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was clearly unimpressed, but Daniela made an effort to smooth things over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard he tried to stay irritated,he rouldn&#39;t resist her tenderness. When she handed hin  an apple, his resolve wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela propped her chin on her hand, watching him with a quiet smile. Cedric bit into the apple with more force than necessary, muttering. &#34;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m letting you off the hook just because you&#39;re being nice. You let yourself get hurt. I could&#39;ve protected you.Why won&#39;t you trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned in and pressed a light kiss to his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric went completely still, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian folded her arms, shaking her head with an éxaggerated sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was completely under Daniela&#39;s spell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stood off to the side, watching as Cedric&#39;s ears burned red from Daniela&#39;s playful teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knit together before she scoffed and turned on her heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts darkened. &#34;Daniela, let&#39;s see how long you can keep that smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stormed into Elyse&#39;s room, her patience worn thin. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m starting a company, and I need to move some funds. I want to mortgage this villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse,busy going over plans for her dream retirement home,barely looked up. Without a second thought,she passed the property deed to Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie slid a document across the table, flipping to the last page. &#34;Sign here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse signed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, Natalie wasted no time-she put the villa up for sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela sat with a tablet in hand, her expression unreadable as she stared at the listing. The villa had once been a generous gift from her mother to Elyse.Now, it was being sold off like a meaningless asset. Her gaze turned cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie hadn&#39;t expected interest in the villa to come so quickly. Just one night after listing, she received an inquiry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The agent said it was an unknown wealthy buyer,ready to transfer the money the same day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie wanted to raise the price, but the buyer wouldn&#39;t budge. &#34;One billion, not a penny more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of her eye, Natalie caught a glimpse of Daniela and Cedric, their intimate exchange twisting something sharp in her gut. She clenched her teeth.&#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The transaction was completed before midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the money hit her account, Natalie turned to the agent. &#34;Who&#39;s the buyer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plenty of people had wealth, but not many could pull together a billion in liquid cash overnight. The agent simply smiled. &#34;A private buyer. Their identity is confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie didn&#39;t press further. She wired the full amount to Cealmaur&#39;s overseas account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve given up everything. Now, do as I say-kill Daniela.&#34;</p>
