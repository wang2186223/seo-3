                <p>After Richard opened his eyes, Alexander gathered Bennett Group&#39;s management team responsible for the failed Elite Lux project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Historically, Bennett Group had been a titan in the industry, orchestrating many high-profile projects and reaping substantial rewards. These managers were accustomed to success and privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the tables had turned. Daniela&#39;s Elite Lux, now a beacon of rigorous oversight, had eclipsed their operations, forcing them to engage with smaller firms they had previously overlooked or assigned only trivial tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shift in dynamics brewed discontent among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their eyes, Daniela had always been overshadowed by her infatuation with Alexander, appearing more as an obsessive admirer than a formidable professional. This underestimation proved costly. Their sloppy execution led to the project failing three consecutive inspections, resulting in an abrupt and humiliating cancellation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mortified by the debacle, they opted against reporting the fiasco up the chain, presuming it tobe a minor blip unlikely to stir significant repercussions given Daniela&#39;s past relationship with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when Alexander brought it up today, it was clear the incident had not faded into obscurity as they had hoped. Caught off-guard, they scrambled to piece together their recollections of the events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Richard absorbed their explanations, his expression turned thunderous. Still weak from his recent ailment, the fury coursing through him nearly sent him spiraling into unconsciousness once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all Cedric&#39;s fault!&#34; one of them declared, his voice laced with desperation to shift the blame. &#34;Our performance has been impeccable! Mr. Bennett,we&#39;ve mastered this craft over the years. How could we possibly falter on such a basic task? Yet, Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scrutinized every minute aspect. We had adhered strictly to his directives, but he still refused to approve our inspections. It&#39;s as though he has it out for us. He even proclaimed, &#39;Not even your boss can sway my decision!&#39; Can you believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his temper flaring, Richard demanded through gritted teeth, &#34;He really said those words?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager paused, a flicker of guilt crossing his features, but he soon affirmed with a decisive nod.&#34;Absolutely! That&#39;s precisely what he said. He&#39;s being a pain in the ass just because he&#39;s got a thing for Ms. Harper. What other stupid reason could there be? It&#39;s likely eating him alive to see her giving Bennett Group any attention.&#34; And now, because of this debacle, there&#39;s no chance for Bennett Group and Elite Lux to join forces on any ventures in the future. It&#39;s exactly what he desired!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fucking ridiculous!&#34; Richard, overwhelmed by indignation, slammed his hand against the bed frame. &#34;Cedric has crossed the line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flung aside the bed covers, resolved to rise,but Alexander restrained him, his expression somber.&#34;Dad, leave this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the project managers made their way out of the hospital room, one asked, &#34;You really think this is going to work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut the hell up and just keep going!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Bennett Group wasn&#39;t stupid enough to challenge Cedric head-on. Pinning the blame on him was far more convenient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, his emotions simmering, confronted Alexander. &#34;We can recover lost money, but Daniela is irreplaceable. If you have any courage as a man,you&#39;ll fight to win her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, Alexander stormed out, his mind set on confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His first destination was Phillips Group, but Cedric was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, he rushed to the bustling construction site,only to discover Cedric had just departed.  Growing more agitated, Alexander headed straight for Daniela&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, he saw Lillian engaged in conversation with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a thunderous expression, Alexander approached and pointed accusingly at Lillian. &#34;Stay out of this, Lillian. Cedric, we need to talk-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s brow furrowed, piecing together the reason behind Alexander&#39;s urgent pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She internally critiqued his character, noting how men like Alexander often shirked responsibility and pointed fingers when things fell apart, expecting the world to revolve around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pathetic losers like him did nothing but exist and piss people off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could voice her thoughts, Cedric intervened with a raised hand,silencing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told Lillian, &#34;If Daniela arrives, please tell her I&#39;m caught up with some pressing business issues but will meet up with you both at the restaurant later Then, he excused himself and followed Alexander.</p>
