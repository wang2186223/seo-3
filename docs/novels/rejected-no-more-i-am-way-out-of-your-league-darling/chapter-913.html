                <p>Not only Nikolas and Damon but even Hamilton was utterly shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, Hamilton had technically been the one calling the shots in the family, but Josh, as the eldest, had never shown him genuine respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh didn&#39;t hesitate to undermine Hamilton in front of everyone, making a habit of embarrassing him whenever the chance arose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today was different. For the first time, Hamilton watched as Daniela put Josh firmly in his place,her voice commanding and impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of emotions churned inside Hamilton</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but think that Daniela was too forceful, almost to the point of being intimidating.The thought of her having full control over the McCoy family sent a ripple of anxiety through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, watching Daniela threaten Josh gave Hamilton.a sense of relief he&#39;d buried for years. Finally, someone was saying what he never dared to say out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela demanded, &#34;You have one hour. If your people don&#39;t come and clean my place, you&#39;ll be the one facing the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call without waiting for a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon stood rooted to the spot, mouths open, still trying to decide if the disaster in front of them or Daniela&#39;s boldness was more shocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After slipping her phone into her pocket, Daniela met Hamilton&#39;s eyes, noticing his shocked expression.&#34;If you want some coffee, you&#39;re welcome to come in.Just don&#39;t forget to pay for the gate you broke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, &#34;With all the money you make, do you really care about such a trivial expense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a small nod. &#34;It&#39;s not about the cost.I just don&#39;t let things slide-I remember every slight.&#34; She changed the subject with an easy/ smile. &#34;By the way, Carol&#39;s been into coffee lately. The aroma&#39;s great. Want to come inside and see if you like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was too proud to say yes. He glanced at Joseph, who immediately jumped in. &#34;Mr. McCoy, we haven&#39;t seen Cedric yet. Maybe he&#39;s hurt somewhere. We should check on him, just to be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught the hint and agreed. &#34;Let&#39;s go see what trouble that brat has gotten himself into.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way through the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela slipped into the kitchen and, wasting no time,whipped up a few mugs of instant coffee before setting them down in front of Hamilton and the others. &#34;This is all I can do for now. The housekeeper&#39;s off today, and honestly, the coffee machine might as well be a spaceship for all I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton couldn&#39;t have cared less about the coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured toward the staircase. &#34;Cedric is upstairs, probably still in the shower. I&#39;ll go check on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She climbed up the stairs, leaving the others behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela headed up, Hamilton drifted toward the windows, staring out at the chaos unfolding outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ambulance had just pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paramedics rushed to help, shocked by the number of people who needed medical attention. Teams hurried to load them up as efficiently as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one ambulance was on site so far. The rest of the staff seemed to be organizing outside, trying to keep order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s phone suddenly buzzed in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh yelled, voice shaking with rage, &#34;Has Daniela lost her mind? She takes out my men and now she wants me to deal with the aftermath?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone was flat as he answered, &#34;You&#39;ve got a problem with her, deal with her yourself. Why drag me into this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh snapped, &#34;Who am I supposed to call then?Isn&#39;t Cedric your son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course he is. But you opened fire like you didn&#39;t care who got caught in it. If you&#39;re looking to blame someone, Daniela&#39;s the one you should be talking to -not me. Honestly, Josh, you sound like a kid tattling to the principal because you couldn&#39;t win on your own. It&#39;s sad, and it won&#39;t help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh, who had called to reprimand Hamilton, found himself lectured instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill settled into Josh&#39;s voice, anger barely concealed. &#34;So, you&#39;re not going to do anything about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Hamilton truly believed Josh was reckless enough to harm Cedric. His nerves were still on edge, unable to fully shake off that worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Cedric was his own flesh and blood, a son he was proud of, someone who&#39;d even cauight the attention of the princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as it turned out, his concern had been overblown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh had thrown everything he had at them, but it still wasn&#39;t enough. Daniela&#39;s effortless handling of the situation made it clear Josh was outmatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton finally relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Daniela&#39;s arrival, he had been on edge. Now,for the first time, satisfaction washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton even chuckled to himself. Josh&#39;s men had been completely outclassed by his son and Daniela,and he couldn&#39;t heIp but savor the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon didn&#39;t need to see Hamilton&#39;s face to sense his satisfaction. Just the way he stood,the tilt of his shoulders... it all gave him away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, phone still in hand and radiating confidence, said, &#34;This is out of my league, Josh.You know as well as I do that Daniela does whatever she wants. No one tells her what to do, not even me.&#34; Josh&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;So you&#39;re refusing to get involved? Fine! If that&#39;s how you want to play it, don&#39;t blame me for what happens next!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a careless shrug, Hamilton agreed. &#34;By all means, go ahead and teach her a real lesson. She probably deserves a proper thrashing anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh gave an irritated huff, ready to end the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton couldn&#39;t resist twisting the knife a little further. &#34;Look, Josh, since we&#39;re family, I&#39;ll give you some friendly advice-Daniela isn&#39;t bluffing.When she says you&#39;ve got one hour, she means it. If you don&#39;t send people to clean her place, she will burn your home down. And when it happens, you can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So furious he could barely form words, Josh slammed the phone down, ending the call with a sharp click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare grin tugged at Hamilton&#39;s lips, smoothing out the lines of his face. He tucked his phone away and finally turned around,feeling lighter than he had in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without his noticing, Daniela had reappeared, this time with Cedric and Carol in tow, making their way down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on Hamilton. Or rather, on the smug smile on his face.</p>
