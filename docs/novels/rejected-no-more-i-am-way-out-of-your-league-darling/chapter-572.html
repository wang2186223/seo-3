                <p>That afternoon, Linden went to the film set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Natalie spotted Linden, her face lost all color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smirked, eyes glinting with mischief. &#34;Well,well,if it isn&#39;t Linden. Natalie, you two were almost married once. Thinking of reigniting that spark?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Daniela had laid out two options for Natalie-leave the country or marry Linden, with a villa as a bonus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Proud and ambitious, Natalie had chosen to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden had been the subject of ridicule for quite some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that he was back, there was no way he would let Natalie feel comfortable.  Nina&#39;s teasing was intentional, her voice loud enough for everyone to hear, making Natalie&#39;s expression darken. Her gaze flickered towards Cormac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden caught the glance and without hesitation,pulled her into a secluded alley, forcing himself onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps echoed nearby as people passed.Natalie&#39;s body trembled, her limbs going weak with humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s harsh words brushed against her ear. &#34;Go on, cause a scene! You&#39;re a big star now, right?Scream-let everyone see who you really are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears streaked down Natalie&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Natalie stumbled out of the alley, hushed whispers spread around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Women these days have no shame. Doing it in public? Can&#39;t they control themselves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she just a supporting actress? Women like her only move up in the industry by sleeping their way to  the top. Absolutely disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The director stormed over, his eyes cold and piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie opened her mouth to explain, but the director cut her off. &#34;Natalie, have some dignity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, every gaze locked onto her, judgment burning in their stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden adjusted his clothes, satisfaction gleaming in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s head dipped, her teeth clenched so hard they ached, her fists trembling at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the entire set laughed at Natalie&#39;s disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pristine, innocent image she had carefully built was shattered beyond repair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those cruel words, Natalie&#39;s breath hitched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, she turned to Cormac, but his expression was frosty. &#34;I hope your personal affairs don&#39;t ruin this film. I&#39;ll be recommending to Ms. Harper that we replace you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words left Natalie frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was always the beloved one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Born into luxury,pampered all her life!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why was everyone choosing Nina over her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did they all treat her like she was beneath them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie couldn&#39;t make sense of it. All she knew was that Linden irritated her to no end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, she reached for something close. As everyone focused on their meals and Linden smirked at his phone, she walked over quietly and plunged the knife deep into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm, crimson blood seeped from the wound,dripping steadily onto the floor. Natalie stared at the spreading bloodstains. A wild exhilaration gripped her, quickly replaced by a strange satisfaction, then creeping fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden&#39;s head jerked up, his wide eyes locking onto hers in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through her. She shoved him forward,yanked the knife free, and drove it back in-hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the final sound Linden would ever make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled up from Natalie&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this moment forward, Linden was gone from her life-no more humiliation, no more shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had it coming!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thought consumed Natalie-everyone who had humiliated her deserved to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric! They needed to perish for her to reclaim her rightful place-the adored and admired young lady she had once been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie heaved Linden&#39;s limp body up, dragging him towards the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A startled voice rang out behind her. &#34;Blood!Someone&#39;s bleeding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned in horrified disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the window, blood dripped ominously, a chilling sight that froze everyone in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic erupted in the cafeteria. Nina darted forward,only to be yanked back by a firm grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around to find Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stood frozen, eyes wide, as if she had just seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, she pulled Nina into an embrace. &#34;Nina, you&#39;re the only one I have now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stiffened in surprise. A moment later, she  shoved Elyse off and turned to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse clutched Nina&#39;s arm. &#34;Where are you going?Your sister&#39;s lost it! If you go after her, she&#39;ll kill you!&#34;Nina&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;If I don&#39;t, she&#39;ll go straight for Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression darkened with greed. &#34;Let her go after them! If she kills Daniela and Cedric, all their wealth will be mine. Linden is already dead by her hands, so why stop there? Let her finish Daniela off too. The wealth we&#39;ll gain will make it all worthwhile!Nina, from now on, you&#39;re my only daughter, and promise to take good care of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina wrenched herself free. &#34;Keep your blood money! I want nothing to do with it!&#34; With that, she bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie grabbed a handheld fan from the car and sped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had already made her way to the asylum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was far calmer than when Daniela had last seen him. &#34;You&#39;re here,Daniela.&#34;</p>
