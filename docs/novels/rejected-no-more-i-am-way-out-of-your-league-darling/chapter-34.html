                <p>Daniela let out a sharp,icy laugh. &#34;So, you came here to apologize? You showed up uninvited, assaulted my staff,and then,without permission, tried to strip my house bare. Is this a new kind of apology I&#39;ve yet to learn about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina opened her mouth to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the movers with a cool smile, Daniela said,&#34;I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble you&#39;ve gone through,but nothing here is leaving. Thank you for your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movers exchanged uneasy glances. One of them finally stepped forward hesitantly. &#34;We still need to cover the transportation costs. We brought a lot of people out here, so someone needs to pay for the service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled, nodding. &#34;Of course. That&#39;s reasonable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze snapped to Katrina, sharp and cutting. &#34;Go on; this one&#39;s on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s lips twitched as she battled the surge of anger rising within her. Forcing a tight smile, she reached into her purse, pulled out a wad of cash, and  handed over ten thousand dollars. &#34;Thank you for your time. I apologize for this little family misunderstanding. Have a safe trip back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movers, now satisfied, quickly packed up their equipment and left, leaving the room quiet once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina glanced at Caiden,her expression unreadable but loaded with intent. Her eyes spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The furniture could wait. She needed to secure the bigger prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden straightened. &#34;Luxor Tower is enormous.There&#39;s no way you need all this space, Daniela. Hand over the 18th to 20th floors to your sister. And one more thing-Joyce is running a clothing store. She wants a collaboration with Elite Lux for a joint collection. Take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could respond, Joyce jumped in with eager enthusiasm. &#34;Dad, I don&#39;t know much about design. Maybe Daniela could handle that part for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded, pleased with the suggestion.&#34;Excellent idea. Daniela, take care of it. And while you&#39;re at it, renovate the floors. I stopped by your office earlier-it&#39;s impressive. Use that as inspiration.Make it just as grand. After all, you&#39;re sisters. Now that you&#39;re successful, it&#39;s your duty to look out for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone hardened, disappointment dripping from every word. &#34;Frankly, I shouldn&#39;t have to spell this out for you. You&#39;re so inconsiderate sometimes. I can&#39;t imagine what kind of man would even want to marry you. And if anyone does, it&#39;ll only be for your money.Daniela, this is all because your mother raised you so poorly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s words grew increasingly cutting, his voice rising with unchecked arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained calm, her expression serene, as though his insults barely registered. She had long since grown accustomed to her father&#39;s harsh words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But across the room, Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed, a dark shadow clouding his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela glanced at him, she noticed the storm brewing in his expression. She offered him a faint,reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Caiden, Daniela spoke evenly, her voice controlled and almost gentle. &#34;The floors? Of course. And the renovations? Why not? You&#39;re absolutely right. Now that I&#39;ve done well, it&#39;s only fair to help my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she said this, Caiden, Katrina,and Joyce visibly relaxed. Relief washed over their faces, quickly replaced by smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was still the same meek, pliable girl, too weak  to stand up for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Joyce exchanged a fleeting look of regret,realizing they could&#39;ve demanded much more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten floors, perhaps even more thanthat-Daniela would&#39;ve agreed without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Caiden said curtly, rising to his feet, his discomfort with Cedric&#39;s oppressive presence evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening his jacket, he turned to Daniela with his usual commanding tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Start the paperwork. Transfer those floors to Joyce.And make sure the renovations use the best materials.No cutting corners-anything less will only cause problems for her down the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the door, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice rang out, calm yet deliberate,halting him mid-step. &#34;Dad, what exactly are you saying? You expect me to hand over the floors to Joyce and pay for her renovations? Are you joking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden froze, his expression darkening as his face tightened. &#34;But you just said-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I had no issue helping my sister. But you meant Joyce?Well, that&#39;s an issue. You see, I hold blood ties in the highest regard. And Joyce? She doesn&#39;t share my mother&#39;s blood. So no, I don&#39;t see her as my sister.And you want me to hand over my property to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile widened, though her gaze was razor-sharp.&#34;If I did that, my mother would surely curse me from her grave for being so stupid. Do you even remember my mother, Dad? When she died, she was drenched in blood. Just last night, I thought I heard her voice.She told me she had only one daughter. When you started talking about helping a sister, for a moment, I thought maybe you and my mom had another child somewhere I didn&#39;t know about. What a pity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face flushed with anger, his balance faltering as he staggered slightly, his fury barely contained.&#34;Your mom and I only had you! I married your stepmother, and Joyce is your sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained unruffled, her faint smile still in place. &#34;Oh, I see now. You mean the baggage that the woman you chose brought into the family. And now you expect me to take care of it? Keep dreaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela!&#34; Caiden roared, his face turning a deep,furious red. &#34;Watch your mouth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anger boiled over, his hand flying into the air,ready to strike.</p>
