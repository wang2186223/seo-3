                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was low, like it came from the hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden recoiled and spoke in a quiet, shaky voice.&#34;When you care about something too much, you throw yourself into it completely at the beginning,but eventually, it becomes tiring. Your mother was incredible. Everyone said I was the luckiest man, and at first, I believed it. She never demanded anything from me except my presence. In the beginning, l cherished those simple, carefree days. But as time passed, I began to notice the whispers from others.My pride was wounded, and I couldn&#39;t find peace.Then I met Katrina. She made me feel a sense of worth I&#39;d never experienced before. I found comfort in that and got caught up in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hand tightened around the cold blade, her grip silent but unyielding. Caiden&#39;s voice quivered as blood dripped from the chair, staining the floor beneath him. &#34;I found a sense of fulfillment with Katrina, something I never experienced with your mother. Katrina respected me,put me first, and let me indulge in my every desire without holding back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Daniela let out a bitter laugh. Her voice was cold and sharp as it echoed through the empty halls of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked down, her gaze dark and intense, before asking, &#34;When you were caught up in your affair, did you ever stop to think about the fact that the self-worth you showed Katrina was built on the honor and status my mother gave you? Without her wealth, do you honestly think Katrina would have even looked at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden quickly looked up, his voice desperate as he tried to explain, &#34;No, no, that&#39;s not true. Katrina always told me she valued me for who l am, not my money. Even if I had nothing, she would still marry me.&#34; Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a mocking smile, as if she&#39;d heard the funniest joke. &#34;Is that so? If it were really like that, then why didn&#39;t you come clean to my mother? If you truly loved each other, she wouldn&#39;t have kept holding on. So,tell me, why did she end up jumping off a building?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden tried to speak several times, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He desperately wished he could prove he had once been deeply loved, but no matter how hard he tried,his mind came up empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, it clicked for him, and he looked up at Daniela,speaking desperately, like someone drowning and trying to grab anything to survive. &#34;Back then,Katrina really loved me. She was always careful about contraception because she didn&#39;t want to hurt you emotionally. Even when she left, she regretted not having another child with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at him with an unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Human nature is the easiest thing to break apart. In that moment, Daniela felt likeshe was holding a sharp blade, slowly cutting through the illusion that Caiden had worked so hard to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? She cared so much about my feelings that she never had a child with you all these years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden nodded, his desperation palpable. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah,well, that&#39;s certainly love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Caiden began to smile, Daniela&#39;s voice,full of confusion, cut through the moment. &#34;Then why did she treat me so badly? You knew how she treated me, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the bitter cold, Daniela was left without proper clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the burning heat of summer, she was sent to pull weeds in the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every lesson a young girl should have learned about her body, Daniela had to face on her own, anxious and overwhelmed.That wasn&#39;t love-not even close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Caiden&#39;s face faltered, his expression stiffening as Daniela&#39;s words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you knowv why Katrina never had a child with you?&#34; Daniela picked up a piece of paper from the table behind her. &#34;Look at this. After Joyce was born,Katrina suffered abuse from her ex-husband and had her uterus removed years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation hit Caiden like a blow to the head,leaving him utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden tried to laugh, but the sound wouldn&#39;t come.He stared at her with wide, confused eyes for a long time before managing to say, &#34;You&#39;re lying to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t need to say more. She knew the truth had already taken root in Caiden&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if he didn&#39;t believe her, it made no difference.Her mother didn&#39;t need Caiden&#39;s hollow remorse.His regret held no weight for either of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of this. Next question. When you met my mother, someone kept feeding you information. What did they want from you? What deal did you make?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden slowly raised his head from the fog of confusion, his chest tightening with every breath.After a long silence, he finally choked out, &#34;No. I didn&#39;t do anything. They didn&#39;t ask for anything...Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blade sank deep into his thigh again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Daniela didn&#39;t pull the knife away right away. Instead, she leaned in closer, her gaze fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden cried out in agony, she began to twist the blade slowly, turning it deeper into his wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gasped, his body wracked with pain, but Daniela&#39;s expression remained unchanged, a cold smile on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. I&#39;m trained in anatomy. I&#39;ll make sure every cut is exact and won&#39;t kill you. You&#39;ll survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Veins popped from Caiden&#39;s forehead and neck as  his body trembled uncontrollably. He struggled to breathe, gasping for air with each desperate inhale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had he felt such a strong urge to end his own life.</p>
