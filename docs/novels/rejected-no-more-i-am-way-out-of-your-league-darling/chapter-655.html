                <p>Joyce handed out the crumpled note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed. The handwriting struck a chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen this before. Somewhere. But where?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce studied Daniela&#39;s unreadable expression and hesitated. &#34;Daniela, we&#39;ve told you everything. You have to keep us safe now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even spare her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence made Joyce&#39;s stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years locked away in that basement, and then -out of nowhere-someone had set her free. Yet,that person never showed themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging from the note, that person must be coveting Daniela&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down Joyce&#39;s spine. Could this put her and Jack in danger? She had no way to tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shot to her feet, her voice urgent.&#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve told you everything. Jack is all I have. You have to promise me-you&#39;ll keep him safe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a cold, sharp laugh. She turned, her gaze like ice in the stormy night. &#34;I couldn&#39;t even protect my own child. What makes you think I can protect yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes went wide with disbelief. &#34;But you&#39;re way stronger than me! If anyone can handle this, it&#39;s you!Daniela, I&#39;m willing to work with you. If that person reaches out again, I&#39;ll tell you right away. Parents always put their kids first. I know you&#39;re not fond of me,but you had a child too. You get it, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t answer. She just turned and walked upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to Caiden, uncertain. &#34;Did she agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gave a small nod. &#34;Probably. She&#39;s got a hard shell, but when it comes to kids,she softens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a breath of relief. &#34;That&#39;s good.&#34; A spark of confidence flickered in her eyes. &#34;Daniela&#39;s alone now. One day, she&#39;ll need Jack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made her way up the stairs, her mind elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She powered on her computer. Outside, the rain hammered against the balcony, a relentless, rhythmic assault. Carol shut the window and turned to Daniela. &#34;Cedric&#39;s still outside. The rain&#39;s coming down hard, and his tent looks like it&#39;s about to get swept away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed silent, her eyes fixed on the computer screen. Using the intel from Caiden and Joyce, she assigned a task to the intelligence department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she rose and headed to the bathroom.A shower would clear her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came back, her hair damp, her focus snapping to the screen once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol took another peek outside. &#34;Cedric&#39;s tent is gone. He&#39;s just standing under a tree now,looking miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Daniela finally spoke. &#34;If he can&#39;t handle it,he&#39;ll leave on his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a small nod and pulled the curtains shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rhythmic clatter of keystrokes filled the quiet room, lingering like a steady pulse in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained immersed in her work, her focus unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Carol stirred awake, she found Daniela still glued to her computer screen. The cold glow of the fluorescent light cast sharp shadows on her face, making her look even more distant,almost untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced outside, noticing the storm had finally passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got to her feet. &#34;Cedric&#39;s still out there. The rain was brutal, and he&#39;s drenched. If he stays out much longer, he&#39;ll end up sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up. &#34;Tell him to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded,recalling Ryan&#39;s and Lillian&#39;s words, then headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was back in no time. &#34;You two are impossible.Daniela, keep working if you want-I&#39;m calling it a night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping away, Carol checked the clock. It was already past two in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pressed on with her investigation, but solid evidence was scarce. The internet was a vast sea of data, and sorting through it felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lines of data flickered across the screen, an endless stream of information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden knock sounded against Daniela&#39;s door. Irritated, she pushed back her chair and opened the door to find Tasha standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper, someone&#39;s standing under the big tree at the entrance. It&#39;s creepy. The security guard wants to know if he should make him leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Daniela grabbed an umbrella and made her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Cedric spotted Daniela making her way toward him from the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something intimidating about the way she moved, making him uneasy. For a second, he considered bolting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in loose loungewear, Daniela stopped in front of him, her voice cutting through the night. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric opened his mouth to speak, but Daniela cut him off. &#34;You have two options. Walk away now, or step inside and we&#39;ll settle the divorce first thing tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Joyce had been quietly watching from the doorway. But as Daniela&#39;s cutting words landed,they instinctively stepped back, retreating into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed,clearly annoyed. &#34;I&#39;m swamped, Cedric.I don&#39;t need this so-called protection. I have my own problems to handle. And you? You should have better things to do than trailing after me all day.Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood there,completely soaked,water dripping from his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit him hard. He just stood there,frozen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, something shattered, bit by bit, like glass cracking under pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange discomfort stirred in Daniela&#39;s chest, but she shoved it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had been right about one thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela decided to be ruthless, no one was spared-not even herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If cruelty was a game, Daniela played it better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was ice-cold. &#34;Leave. Now. If you&#39;re still here in five minutes, expect a call from my lawyer first thing tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Daniela spun on her heel and strode back&lt;into the villa, never once looking back,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed behind her with a force that echoed through the house, making Caiden and Joyce flinch in the guest rooms. Once,Daniela and Cedric had been inseparable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, her words carved a clear, merciless line between them.</p>
