                <p>After Cedric had gone, Katrina sat inside, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue. &#34;Daniela, just look at your father now, lying there like this. And all that money overseas...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a glance at Caiden, lying in the bed with his mouth slack on one side. Her tone stayed even.&#34;That&#39;s not what matters right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that if she pushed Katrina too hard, the woman might very well resort to killing Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s goal was to make Katrina expose herself-not to start fighting over the inheritance yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her response, Katrina couldn&#39;t hide the flicker of delight that lit up her face. She bobbed her head eagerly. &#34;Yes, exactly! That&#39;s what family is allabout,Daniela. Blood is thicker than water, after all. I knew you still cared for your father. So regarding the villa...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cut her off mid-sentence, her voice unwavering. &#34;I&#39;ll arrange for someone to sell it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s cheerful expression faltered. She forced an uneasy laugh. &#34;Daniela, isn&#39;t it a little inappropriate to sell your father&#39;s villa while he&#39;s still unconscious?We don&#39;t even know when he&#39;ll regain consciousness.There&#39;s no urgency here. His belongings aren&#39;t going anywhere,are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her calm words, Katrina&#39;s thoughts were whirling. She had already begun contacting potential buyers for the villa, planning to funnel the money into a hidden account where Daniela would never trace it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her scheme unraveled, Katrina figured she could always pin the blame on Caiden and let him take the fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, she took Daniela&#39;s hospital visit as a sign that she still had some concern for her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had thought everything through, sure that Daniela would go along with her plan. But Daniela&#39;s reaction completely threw her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that villa Caiden&#39;s own property? It was bought with the company&#39;s money. As the main shareholder,I have every right to manage it. What makes that wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s biting response, Katrina&#39;s fists tightened in anger.&#34;Yes,but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she finish, Daniela interrupted, her voice turning icier. &#34;Or do you expect me to handle the overseas assets as well?&#34; The mention of foreign assets made Katrina&#39;s face contort with an involuntary twitch. &#34;Fine. If you insist,go ahead. The villa isn&#39;t really worth much anyway. If the company needs the money, then...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was composed, but inside,Katrina was seething with fury. Daniela! This scheming woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the villa is a huge property, and as a young woman,you might find it difficult to manage the sale.Alexander is here today, and you trust him,don&#39;t you?Why not let him take care of it for you? Doesn&#39;t that sound better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s plan was straightforward. If Alexander took charge,she could control the timing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could drag things out long enough for her to sell the villa and move the money before Daniela even noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had remained silently in the corner,observing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to him, flashing a sweet smile.&#34;Alexander, I&#39;m afraid this will be a bit of a burden for you. Daniela trusts you implicitly, and if I handled it,she wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded slightly, his tone collected and professional. &#34;Of course, leave it to me. Bennett Group specializes in real estate, so selling a villa is no problem. Since both you and Daniela trust me, I&#39;ll...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, a voice as cold and sharp as a blade interrupted him. &#34;I don&#39;t trust him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander froze, his unfinished sentence hanging in the air. Slowly, he turned to face Daniela. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela repeated her words, emphasizing each one.&#34;I said, I don&#39;t trust Alexander to handle this.&#34;</p>
