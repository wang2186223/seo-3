                <p>Nikolas sat there, momentarily frozen. It took him a while to process. &#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained stern, and her voice carried a sharp edge that shut down any hint of humor.&#34;Just tell me the amount. How much money do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Damon felt an odd feeling. One that mixed gratitude, validation, and a hint of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated,weighing his words. &#34;Ten million, maybe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he spoke, anxiety crept in. &#34;But you know my situation-without the McCoy family&#39;s resources, their network, or support. There&#39;s no telling what will happen to that money, or if I&#39;ll even make it work. Only now,with my funds dried up, do I realize just how huge ten million really is. If I end up losing it, I honestly don&#39;t know when, or if I could ever pay you back. Are you sure you want to go through with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting on the sofa with her laptop, Daniela looked at Nikolas&#39; eyes.&#34;SO1all you&#39;re asking for is ten million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied his expression for a moment. &#34;You&#39;re certain that&#39;s enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, thrown off by Daniela&#39;s question. Suddenly, he felt awkward and looked down. &#34;You know what? Never mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed himself up, glancing back to see Daniela lounging against the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought flashed through his mnind. Of course, she wouldn&#39;t take him seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela spoke up again, calm and focused. &#34;Based on what you just explained, ten million won&#39;t cut it. If you&#39;re committed to this, I want a detailed budget, one that covers everything this project needs to succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned. He turned his head around, surprise flickering in his eyes. &#34;Wait, what did you just say?&#34; Nikolas&#39; cheeks were flushed with a rush of excitement as Daniela met his gaze.′′|sthat your final budget number? If it is, I think you should check your math. Something&#39;s off. If not, I need the real figure. I&#39;m not concerned how long it takes for you to repay me. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood rooted to the spot, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only handed Daniela a rough sketch along with some estimated costs. There was no way she could realize his figure was farfrom accurate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That isn&#39;t the final budget. My plan is to get through the first phase and find additional funding later on...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone stayed steady and direct, as if she were talking to Nikolas as an equal. There was no hint of superiority, only respect. &#34;If you could secure more funding, you wouldn&#39;t be here asking me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked defeated for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m offering you a real opportunity,&#34; Daniela continued, watching Nikolas&#39; expression color with emotion. &#34;I need you to come up with a realistic budget and a detailed project plan. Can you have that ready by tomorrow morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Energy flooded Nikolas as the words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time someone truly listened to him, not because he was from the McCoy family,but because of his ideas and effort. She treated him as an equal, discussing his proposal without judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fierce resolve began to burn within Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, a confident light in his eyes. &#34;You&#39;ll have the full proposal on your desk by tomorrow morning,promise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his spirits soaring, Nikolas marched off to his room, ready to work through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela turned her focus back to her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric threw himself into the task of tracking down where the unknown phone number came from. Carol turned to Daniela and asked, &#34;Are you really planning to support Nikolas? It&#39;s obvious Hamilton&#39;s been holding him down all these years. Nikolas seems desperate for someone to believe in him. But what if he&#39;s just all talk? He could end up blowing through the fortune for nothing. On the other hand, if he actually has talent, he might turn into serious competition down the line. Aren&#39;t you worried he&#39;ll become a rival to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas happened to have something to confirm with Daniela. He stopped a few meters away upon hearing Carol&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, with her back to Nikolas, said calmly, &#34;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Cedric can handle whatever comes his way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t know how to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas thought Daniela had nothing more to say, she added, &#34;I don&#39;t have any siblings. I can&#39;t say what having siblings means to Cedric, but it must matter to him. Otherwise, Cedric wouldn&#39;t have softened and let them stay. That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather do what I can to keep this connection intact. Nikolas&#39; project actually has potential, and it just needs a proper budget, somewhere close to eighty million. I&#39;d spent severaI times that much on a pair of cufflinks. If investing a few tens of millions proves my sincerity to Nikolas, then I tink it&#39;s worth every penny. Besides, if Nikolas ever gets out-of line, Cedric isn&#39;t someone who&#39;ll back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol grinned. &#34;You&#39;ve got a lot of faith inCedric,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. There was no arrogance in her tone, just certainty. &#34;With me by his side, Cedric is invincible.&#34;</p>
