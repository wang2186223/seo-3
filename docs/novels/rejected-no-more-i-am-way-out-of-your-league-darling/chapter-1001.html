                <p>No sooner had the housekeeper finished speaking than the guest room door swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cheerful grin, Brad stepped into view, waggling his finger swaddled in bandages. &#34;I owe the housekeeper an apology for all the trouble. Got a bit reckless with a knife, and this was the result.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric barely acknowledged him, giving a dismissive sound before urging Daniela to go ahead and rest upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cedric set about making juice for Daniela, the housekeeper slipped quietly into the kitchen to tidy up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through loading oranges into the juicer, Cedric paused to ask, &#34;Has anyone else been in here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing to recall, the housekeeper shook her head. &#34;No one has come through the kitchen. After Mr. McCoy hurt himself, he went to lie down. I&#39;ve been cleaning the living room ever since, and he hasn&#39;t left his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking that in stride, Cedric gave a nod, poured the juice, and set it aside. He reached into the fridge,grabbed a pomegranate, and began peeling it. Midway through the task, a strange sensation prickled the back of his neck-a pair of eyes seemed fixed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced back, but whatever had been watching quickly disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the fruit in hand, Cedric climbed the stairs and noticed Brad and Hamilton stationed in the living room,watching television together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased with himself, Brad tracked Cedric&#39;s progress up the stairs, then turned to Hamilton, his grin wide.&#34;Hamilton, when our father named you to lead McCoy Group, it was the right call. I finally see how much you had to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Brad added, &#34;Seems Nikolas is causing quite a stir in the business world these days.Just recently, at a gathering, his name kept coming up. Would you believe it-the Rowe family, those big players in jewelry, even invited me out for coffee. But I suspect their real interest is meeting Nikolas.&#34; While Hamilton&#39;s attention stayed mostly on the flickering screen, he answered, &#34;If they want to see Nikolas,let them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts kept circling back to Daniela and the coming babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, Brad leaned in and whispered, &#34;Are you really that oblivious? The Rowe family practically sit on a mountain of jewels, and their only child is a daughter. Egan Rowe never hides the fact he wants a son-in-law to step up and lead. I&#39;d bet he already has Nikolas in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sent him a sideways look. &#34;I doubt that&#39;s the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Egan could easily reach Nikolas himself. What&#39;s the point in asking me for an introduction unless he&#39;s already sizing him up for the role? Trust me, the old man has his sights set.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Hamilton laugh. &#34;Good for them. The Rowe family has plenty of influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re more than influential. That family is our main competitor for the number two spot in the rankings. If their daughter married Nikolas, the alliance would be nearly unstoppable. There&#39;s just one thing...&#34; Brad trailed off,reluctant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s bothering you?&#34; Hamilton prompted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping his voice, Brad replied, &#34;Nikolas seems uninterested. I even tried bringing it up to him. He brushed it off. And just a couple of nights back, I caught him sneaking food to Carol out in the garden after midnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His finger jabbed toward Carol, who was busy with a game in the pavilion outside. &#34;He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off her. I mean it, Hamilton. Out of everyone in our family, Nikolas has the most promise. We can&#39;t allow him to throw that away. Pairing him with the Rowe heiress would secure his future. You agree, right? Carol&#39;s wild streak isn&#39;t what he needs. Having Daniela here is enough excitement. If Carol joins the famly too, you&#39;ll never get a moment&#39;s peace as their father-in-law. We can handle a little chaos, but if Nikolas makes the wrong choice, it could ruin his life.&#34; After amoment, Brad fixed a serious gaze on him. &#34;Hamilton, do you see where I&#39;m coming from?&#34;</p>
