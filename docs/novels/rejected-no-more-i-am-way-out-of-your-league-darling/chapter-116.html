                <p>Katrina dialed the doctor&#39;s number,her movements tinged with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce slumped into the sofa, her tears flowing unchecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Caiden occupied a chair, absorbing the scene: Katrina issuing firm commands to the doctor and Joyce&#39;s despairing cries piercing the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mixed emotions churned within Caiden as he witnessed the unfolding drama,his mind wrestling with indecision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,unable to remain passive, he addressed Joyce.&#34;This illness is no small matter, Joyce. Perhaps you should consider consulting multiple hospitals, seeking various opinions. Weren&#39;t you once a director at Daniela&#39;s company? Despite everything, you&#39;re still on their roster. Maybe Daniela could recommend some specialists. She&#39;s well-connected, far more than we are now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned, her face twisted in a grimace. &#34;Dad,please, not this. My friends have already mocked me enough. Do you think Daniela would really help? She  assigned me to supervise the restrooms. It&#39;s degrading,sitting there all day. It&#39;s clear she&#39;s just trying to retaliate. How could she possibly lend a hand after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Katrina ended the call, she caught the tail end of the conversation and entered the room, her eyes narrowing in displeasure. &#34;What did you just say?Daniela put you in charge of the restrooms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Joyce replied, dabbing at her eyes, &#34;Mom,what&#39;s Dad thinking? Daniela is using her position to demean me, and he suggests I go groveling back to her? It seems like he&#39;d rather enjoy seeing me humiliated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her outburst, Joyce turned sharply and concealed her tear-streaked face within the soft folds of the pillow, her sobs wrenching painfully at Katrina&#39;s heartstrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shot Caiden a fiery look, her voice thick with resolve. &#34;Caiden! Daniela torments Joyce relentlessly,and I refuse to stand idly by! Once I&#39;ve wrapped up my current affairs, I&#39;m going to make her answer for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her features were set in a fierce mask of determination. Her eyes blazed, and her hands were balled into tight fists as though she were ready to take on the world. Caiden, despite his well-meaning advice, found himself the target of her ire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled deeply, a hint of resignation in his tone &#34;Alright, confront Daniela if you must. But in your current state, you&#39;re unlikely to even gain entry to Elite Lux. Katrina, I&#39;m seriously suggesting you seek assistance from Daniela. You&#39;ve never held a high-ranking position-you don&#39;t realize how those at the top can resolve matters with a mere word, far more efficiently than one can from the bottom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina scoffed at his suggestion, her disdain palpable.&#34;Caiden! Now you&#39;re trying to boast? Really? And tell me, when have you ever held a high position? Oh,that&#39;s right-through Brylee! Riding on a woman&#39;s coattails, and now you parade around as if you&#39;re some paragon of virtue? What exactly are you proud of? Any man of honor wouldn&#39;t brag about exploiting a woman&#39;s success. You&#39;re not just unashamed-you&#39;re actually proud? How utterly disgraceful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was utterly speechless following her rebuke.He gazed at Katrina, his eyes wide as he observed her once tender expression now contorted in anger. For a brief moment, he was uutterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice quavered as he looked into her eyes, the hurt evident in his tone. &#34;How can you accuse me of such things? To say I leeched off a woman? Katrina!  Weren&#39;t you the one who, while I was drunk,lavished me with praises about my talent, admired my demeanor, complimented my handwriting, and celebrated my artistic sensibilities? You told me I was pure, untouched by the taint of money. I&#39;ve clung to every word you said for years. And didn&#39;t you confide in me about the hardships you faced, how your husband mistreated you, and how you yearned to run away with me? When Brylee departed and your ex-husband passed away, I was the one who eagerly proposed, dismissing the rumors that whispered we were together before our marriage was official.For your sake, I&#39;ve endured endless criticism over the years, and Daniela has shed silent tears in her room time and again because of it. But none of that mattered to me because I loved you. I wanted nothing more than to be with you. I was genuine in my feelings. And now, you say I&#39;m just leeching off a woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Caiden&#39;s eyes as he sat there, each word weighed down by sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared intently at Katrina, his gaze searching her face for a sign of the love they once shared. &#34;Is this truly how you&#39;ve always seen me?&#34; he asked,hoping against hope for her to refute his fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Katrina just stood there,her expression chillingly indifferent. Then, her lips curled into a cruel sneer as a mocking laugh escaped her. &#34;Caiden, we&#39;re adults;  we need to own our choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes widened in utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pressed on, her voice sharp with accusation.&#34;Remember Brylee? She wNas loyal to you. And you?You betrayed her and ignored your own child. You mentioned Daniela crying in secret, but do you knoW the real story? That day, when you dragged me into your home and we made love on the couch, Daniela saw us! Ever wonder why she started sleepwalking?consulted a doctor, and she was suffering from severe depression. Can you even grasp how many nights she wept silently when you thought she was just being stubborn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina gestured to a spot near her eye. &#34;Right here,Daniela got this huge scar during that time. It&#39;s less noticeable now, but do you think if she hated you back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s entire body shook with the force of his emotions. Gazing at Katrina, he no longer recognized the tender-hearted woman he once thought he knew.In her place stood a monster-a complete monster!</p>
