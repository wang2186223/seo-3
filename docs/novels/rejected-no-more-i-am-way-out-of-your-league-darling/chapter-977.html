                <p>&#34;Since you already knew about the prenuptial agreement | signed with Josh, why did you agree to meet with me?&#34; Felicia asked, genuinely confused.&#34;Is there something more you&#39;re after from Josh, aside from his money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Felicia a quick glance and grinned.&#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia arched an eyebrow. &#34;So that means we might be able to work together after all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small shake of her head. &#34;No. There&#39;s no possibility of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felícia&#39;s confidentsmile slowlydisappeared. &#34;Whynot?&#34;She had thought she&#39;d shown Daniela she was clever enough, and that Daniela would be interested in partnering with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could see straight through Felicia&#39;s hopes. The girl. still wore her heart on her sleeve, far too young to hide her feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did think Felicia had a certain cleverness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least when it came to love, Felicia was more Case perceptive than Victoria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her smile, but her words were direct and unfiltered. &#34;Home-wreckers never get away with what they do. You&#39;re smart enough to figure out I&#39;ve been working with Victoria. You thought you could offer me something, so you agreed to marry Josh with a prenuptial in place. But you made one mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia had no smile left. Her curiosity outweighed her pride. &#34;What did I miscalculate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat back and answered without hesitation, &#34;I&#39;IL never side with someone who destroys families. Men who betray their wives deserve every bit of scorn.Women who break up marriages aren&#39;t innocent,either. Anyone who tries to climb the social ladder through schemes like that will never find true happiness. Any woman who tore a family apart deserved to face the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a long face, Felicia murmured, &#34;I don&#39;t get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile touched Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;A smart person understands her own boundaries. Young women like you,with nothing but youth and looks, always believe the world owes them something. I&#39;ve seen plenty just like you before. I&#39;ll take care of the bill for this coffee.Sooner or later, you&#39;ll realize that your cleverness isn&#39;t enough to navigate the complicated games you&#39;re trying to play.&#34; Without another word, Daniela rose from her seat and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felicia&#39;s shock quickly turned to anger, then frustration. She slammed her fist onto the table. &#34;I can&#39;t believe I read her so wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the very next day, Felicia ended her marriage with Josh. Their wedding vows dissolved overnight,replaced by a battle of interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched Daniela, clearly impressed and maybe even a little awestruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad asked, &#34;Did you hear about Felicia meeting Daniela yesterday? I heard she rushed home and divorced Josh, saying her youth was too valuable to waste on an old man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added, &#34;Jules called me first thing today. Josh is both furious and humiliated. All of Oiscoll is laughìng at him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worried frown creased Hamilton&#39;s face. &#34;Josh won&#39;t let this go. He&#39;s bound to blame Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad just chuckled. &#34;If you ask me, Daniela did it on purpose just to push his buttons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan agreed. &#34;Right. She doesn&#39;t seem scared of him at all, Hamilton. I wouldn&#39;t worry.&#34; Hamilton&#39;s expression grew serious. &#34;Do either of you even think before you talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Brad and Ethan glanced over in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued, &#34;Why do you think Daniela went out of her way to provoke Josh? She already knows who was responsible for her mother&#39;s death, so why hasn&#39;t she taken action yet? Lately, things have been quiet for you two, but have you forgotten why Daniela came to Oiscoll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad looked taken aback. &#34;Are you saying Daniela has been digging for the person behind the explosion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan felt a shiver run down his spine. &#34;But we still have no clue who&#39;s actually responsible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t say a word. That fear had always lingered in the back of his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever orchestrated the explosion had done a masterful job staying hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, out in the open, was now exposed. The mastermind continued lurking, and with Daniela expecting a child, there was no doubt more trouble was brewing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The risk surrounding Daniela was only growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, too restless to remain seated, got up at once and set out to look for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found Cedric in the kitchen, focused on preparing pastries for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those long,steady hands worked the dough with skill,his face calm, eyes fixed on his task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from the doorway, Hamilton felt a surge of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric could be seen preparing pastries with the flair of a star chef, and it was clear why Daniela found herself drawn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling slightly reassured, Hamilton remarked, &#34;Let Daniela know she needs to step back from the explosion case. She has to stop her investigation for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change, his voice even and unbothered. &#34;She calls the shots on the big things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was stunned. &#34;Excuse me? You said you&#39;d handle the serious stuff and she&#39;d take care of the rest. When did that change?&#34;</p>
