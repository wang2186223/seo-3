                <p>Daniela showed up on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drove, Hamilton sat in stunned silence. He switched off his phone, too shaken to speak</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her full attention on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gust of cold wind swept past as they continued on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton slowly turned his head, eyes settling on Daniela&#39;s calm profile. After a long pause, he spoke in a trembling voice. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ve been swindled out of a lot of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her gaze fixed on the road, steering clear of the heavy traffic. &#34;Hmm,&#34; she replied quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton went on. &#34;I spent my whole life working hard, and now, at this age, someone tricked me out of so much money. I can&#39;t handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years later, whenever Hamilton thought back to that day and everything he said to Daniela, shamne would creep in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was nearly falling apart in front of his daughter-in-law, all over lost money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But back then, the words had come without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around Daniela, his defenses dropped. He couldn&#39;t hide how broken he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>f he had to open up to anyone, it would be Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unreliable brothers, his letdown of five sons, and even Cedric, who was not close with him-none of :hem felt like the right person to turn to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>3ut Daniela-his daughter-in-law he once dismissed-felt like the only dependable one right then. &#34;Daniela...&#34; Hamilton&#39;s voice cracked as he looked at her steady expression-so calm, like nothing could shake her. Maybe that was why he couldn&#39;t stop himself. &#34;I was scammed. A huge amount! That was the money I&#39;d set aside for my grandkids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt completely overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela handed him a tissue without taking her eyes off the road. &#34;If you mean the babies I&#39;m carrying, they won&#39;t need that much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept a steady expression as she maneuvered through the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know?&#34; Hamilton said sharpy. &#34;Children are precious. Everything they eat or useshould be good enough for royalty. My grandchildren, at the very least, deserve a full team of devoted caregivers. As they grow, they must go to top international schools and learn horseback riding, archery, piano, and violin-each taught by the best. All of that costs a fortune. My grandkids are meant to have the best from the moment they&#39;re born. And when they grow up, they&#39;ll have to get married, raise kids, and be ready for houses, cars, and weddings. You have no idea how overwhelmed I am right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a soft laugh. &#34;Cedric will handle all of it. You really don&#39;t need to stress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela-being the richest person alive-already had everything she could possibly need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely,Hamilton didn&#39;t need to feel so burdened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll only understand once you become a grandparent. You and Cedric, as their parents, will handle some things, but I also have a duty. If I don&#39;t prepare, they might think.their grandfather didn&#39;t care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod as she turned the wheel. She didn&#39;t argue with him and said lightly,&#34;Then keep working hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sniffled and pulled out another tissue. &#34;I&#39;ll have to return to my old line of work-there&#39;s no other way. I&#39;ve got a whole family depending on me. Everything costs so much. Just thinking about it makes my heart hurt. Daniela, you know that feeling, right? Like you&#39;ve been hollowed out? My head is still spinning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint smile. &#34;Really? Then treat it as a lesson from life. But do you really have to let it drag you down like this?&#34; Hamilton shot back. &#34;Why not? It&#39;s a huge amount of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela parked in front of the villa. &#34;Didn&#39;t you put most of your money into New McCoy Group? You&#39;ll get returns later. Think of it as a smart investment. Don&#39;t worry. Cedric&#39;s good at making money-he won&#39;t let you take a loss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Hamilton let out a quiet sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unbuckled his seatbelt and watched Daniela walk toward the house. But he stayed back, uneasy and reluctant to go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned back, car keys in hand, and saw Hamilton lingering at the door. She smiled. &#34;Want to know how to bounce back from a rough patch quickly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton assumed she was about to launch into one of those long, motivational speeches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together. &#34;I&#39;m too old for pep talks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope,&#34; Daniela said. &#34;What really works better than any pep talk is seeing someone who&#39;s worse off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first,Hamilton didn&#39;t get what she meant. Still, he followed her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they opened the villa door, two ghost-pale faces greeted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton instinctively took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His two brothers lunged at him, grabbing onto him as they cried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton, Josh is completely heartless! The news just said hé ran off-he actually ran away! We&#39;re his brothers! It&#39;s bad enough to scam outsiders, but he cheated us! That was everything I owned! What do l do now? I&#39;m ruined! I swear, I&#39;m going to jump off a building!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While their cries filled the room, Daniela tossed her keys on the shoe cabinet, settled onto the couch,and turned on the TV like nothing unusual was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was showing the latest news about the fraud scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One image showed Josh stepping onto a private jet.The female news anchor spoke clearly. &#34;We urge the public to stay alert and beware of financial scams.&#34;</p>
