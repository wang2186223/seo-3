                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression changed as if a thought had just struck her. &#34;I happened to catch the news earlier. It said you announced the closure of your gaming company today. Would that have anything to do with Daniela&#39;s game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, covering her mouth as though in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard and Alexander realized why Katrina had arranged the dinner tonight. Both men&#39;s expressions darkened, the weight of the situation evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, noticing the change in their demeanor, smiled sweetly as if she hadn&#39;t noticed a thing. &#34;Daniela really crossed the line this time. The divorce was one thing, but this? All that money you poured in-it must have been so hard-earned. You must have lost quite a bit, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words made Richard push himself abruptly from his chair, his face taut with frustration. &#34;Katrina, what exactly are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,still calm, gave him a measured smile, her expression radiating calculated charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t respond immediately. Instead, she reached for Joyce&#39;s plate and began serving her food with deliberate slowness. When shefinally looked back at Richard, her smile remained inact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you so upset, Richard? Why direct your anger at us? Daniela made her decisions all on her own.We couldn&#39;t have stopped her, even if we&#39;d tried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile widened, and she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. Her eyes glimmered with an unspoken agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard and Alexander remained quiet, their focus entirely on her. They both knew she wasn&#39;t done speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Katrina continued after a brief pause,I mentioned before, Daniela is part of the Harper family, and that&#39;s not going to change. Even if we wanted to step in and fix this, our hands are tied. I&#39;ve watched Alexander grow into such a fine young man. I truly hope everything works out for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard frowned. Something about her words didn&#39;t sit right withhim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s tone grew even gentler, almost coaxing. &#34;Richard, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you considered settling down and focusing on the next generation? Isn&#39;t that what really matters at this stage in life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes narrowed as suspicion crept into his expression. &#34;What exactly are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile turned sly. &#34;It&#39;s simple, really. Daniela&#39;s decisions are a reflection of our family. We stand by her no matter what. If, for example, Alexander were to marry into the Harper family, wouldn&#39;t that naturally strengthen the bond between our families? It would benefit your businesses as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication of her words hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone at the table, except for Joyce, understood her underlying message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had just proposed a marriage alliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard lowered his gaze, clearly unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, however, kept his expression blank. &#34;I want nothing to do with Daniela. That&#39;s never going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina chuckled lightly, her composure unshaken. &#34;Wo said anything about Daniela? I was talking about Joyce. You and she grew up together. It would be such a waste if the two of you didn&#39;t end up together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth to refuse, but Katrina stopped him with a well-timed, disarming smile.&#34;Alexander, you need to think ahead. Look at Daniela. She&#39;s already brought Cedric home. Young people these days don&#39;t waste any time. For all we know, she might already be expecting. You don&#39;t want to fall too far behind her, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze stayed fixed on him, studying his every movement with calculated precision. She searched for any sign of unease or hesitation, knowing that even the smallest crack in his composure would be a victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she got, however, was far beyond what she had anticipated. Alexander&#39;s hand froze mid-motion, the knife he was holding suspended in his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pupils narrowed, and an icy storm of emotions flickered in his eyes-confusion, resentment, and something far darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the harsh glow of the chandelier, his gaze locked with hers. He parted his lips as though to say something, but the words never came. Instead, he lowered the knife to the table, his expression drained of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the dinner passed in tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina leaned towards Alexander before stepping into her car.′′A|lexander, it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s Daniela or Joyce. Marrying into the Harper family is all the same. If Cedric can make himself at home with us,so can you-especially given your history with Joyce. Take your time to think it over, and let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was calm, yet her words carried a quiet authority that left little room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That momentary crack in Alexander&#39;s composure gave Katrina all the confidence she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain he would come around-whether because he still carried feelings for Daniela or because his pride wouldn&#39;t let him walk away entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the drive home, Caiden finally broke the silence. &#34;You said Joyce and Daniela are alike. Do you really believe that? Do you think Alexander will agree to this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression darkened, and her voice turned sharp. &#34;What exactly are you suggesting? Do you think Joyce is somehow inferior to Daniela? Is there a reason marrying Joyce would be such an impossible idea?What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina knew Joyce better than anyone, but she still defended her daughter firecely. &#34;Just wait. Alexander and Richard will call us soon enough,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Alexander&#39;s personal feelings didn&#39;t matter. The only thing that counted was ensuring Joyce married him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would allow her daughter to live a life that paled in comparison to Daniela&#39;s. &#34;And if Alexander refuses?&#34; Caiden asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then we&#39;ll find someone else,&#34; she replied without hesitation.&#34;Joyce is the sister of the Elite Lux CEO. She could have her pick of suitors, no matter what. Even if she had a dozen kids, there would still be men líning up to marry her.&#34;</p>
