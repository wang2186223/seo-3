                <p>Nikolas observed the inner conflict playing out on Alexander&#39;s face and couldn&#39;t help but release a mocking laugh,laced with biting sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Can&#39;t bear the idea of losing face? Alexander, didn&#39;t you say you&#39;d risk everything for Daniela? Was that just empty words? In this,you&#39;re no match for Cedric. When it comes to Daniela, Cedric is far more devoted. And honestly,are you really so blind? The association and your reputation pale in comparison to Daniela. She spent three years in a coma, yet Elite Lux still stood tall.Having Daniela by your side is like owning the world&#39;s wealth. And you&#39;re worried about this pitiful, broken association? Only a fool would waste time on such insignificant things. If I were you, l&#39;d act now-while Daniela&#39;s only just awoken and hasn&#39;t yet developed deep feelings for Cedric. I&#39;d seize the moment instead of fixating on the fleeting value of your so- called pride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rose to his feet. &#34;I&#39;ve said all I needed to.1don&#39;t have the energy for more. You have one day to think it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned on his heel, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you help me?&#34; Alexander called out,desperation in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes, disgusted. Alexander wasn&#39;t even close to being a real man. Chasing after a woman, and still needing someone else to fight his battles?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the core, it was a lack of resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply didn&#39;t have the guts to take the plunge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s feelings for Daniela weren&#39;t genuine, and that was always the thing that held him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why he endlessly sought validation from others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t bring himself to entertain such a foolish question. He walked out, dismissing Alexander&#39;s desperate cry. &#34;Does Daniela really feel nothing for Cedric yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t respond, still walking without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the car, his secretary glanced at him,puzzled. &#34;Sir, do you think Alexander will agree to become your secretary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary remained confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked. &#34;Alexander is the type who talks a big game. Life and death, all casually discussed. But when it comes time to act, he hesitates. Offer him enough, and he&#39;ll bend. At the end of the day, men like him are no different from most-they&#39;ll chase after whatever benefits them and run from anything that might harm them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded in understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the real issue is someone like Cedric! He&#39;s obsessive, and his motives are pure. A man like that can&#39;t be swayed by anything you offer. He knows exactly what he possesses and what he&#39;s willing to give. No matter how much you throw at him, he remains untouched. Those types are the hardest to deal with!&#34; Nikolas added, a hint of irritation in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, why else would he go through the trouble of seeking Alexander out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had crossed paths with many like Alexander and knew precisely how to manage them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when his secretary informed him that Alexander had agreed to the collaboration proposaI later that evening, Nikolas was hardly surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Collaboration proposal? He&#39;s just trying to save face. If it weren&#39;t for his seven years with Daniela, I wouldn&#39;t even waste my time with someone like him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas always carried himself with that air of superiority. Daniela was engrossed in a book in the living room when Nikolas straightened himself and cleared his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a strange unease, unsure why his usual confidence faded in her presence. He felt as though he was her subordinate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, l&#39;ve secured a preliminary cooperation agreement with Phillips Group. Also, I&#39;ve recently hired a new secretary. You don&#39;t mind, do you?&#34;Nikolas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of annoyance crept in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he reporting the hiring of a secretary to Daniela,anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On what grounds did he feel the need to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet for some reason, he felt compelled to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas watched Daniela, irritation lacing his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, still lost in her book, said casually,&#34;Pass me the tissues.&#34; Nikolas handed her the tissues and grumbled, &#34;I&#39;m not your servant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up. &#34;Oh, really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifferent tone only fueled Nikolas&#39; frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care who you hire as your secretary, but if you let anyone step foot into the villa, I&#39;ll make sure you regret ii,&#34;Daniela said without looking up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shot back, &#34;Why not? My secretary handles my meals and clothing, which are crucial to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up at the privileged young man before her. &#34;Because this is my home. If you want more freedom, you&#39;re welcome to move to a hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sharp reply left him momentarily speechless. He glanced toward the kitchen and tried to negotiate.&#34;After all, I&#39;m Cedric&#39;s brother! I should have some privileges others don&#39;t. It&#39;s just a secretary; you can&#39;t be this strict with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed amused by the word &#34;brother.&#34; She glanced at Nikolas and said, &#34;Then perhaps you should show the respect due to your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swallowed his pride, clenching his teeth.&#34;Fine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;You can bring one secretary in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes, fists clenched, a heavy resentment settling in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He toyed with the idea of staging some kind of act,maybe even feign an injury, just to get closer to her without much hassle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The temptation was strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he looked up at Daniela&#39;s indifferent profile, he didn&#39;t have the courage to take the risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this world, there were few who could compare to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Nikolas knew, deep down, he wasn&#39;t one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t afford to gamble on it.</p>
