                <p>Hamilton barely caught a word from the phone. The chaos outside had his full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes locked on Joseph, his loyal secretary of many years, now lying battered on the ground,a thin line of blood at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the security detail, Hamilton gave an order. &#34;Get Joseph to the hospital. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards didn&#39;t hesitate, quickly lifting Joseph and carrying him out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still in his relaxed home clothes, Hamilton lowered himself onto the sofa, his tone sharp and icy. &#34;You stormed into my house like this and roughed up my secretary. What&#39;s next? Planning to shove me aside,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d been living in their own arrogance for so long,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>they&#39;d forgotten the humility it took to actually ask for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers traded uneasy glances. Their need to save their dignity overshadowed everything else, leading to an awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched them, knowing their patterns all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, he&#39;d always let things slide for the sake of family. Lately, though, it felt like he was the only one who cared about that bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since nobody seemed willing to speak first, Hamilton wasn&#39;t about to make it easy on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat back, coffee in hand, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration and embarrassment warred on their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh scowled, taking in Hamilton&#39;s unbothered demeanor. In years past, Hamilton would have greeted them warmly, never letting the mood turn so sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton.&#34; Josh finally broke the silence, sinking into a chair and signaling for the housekeeper to bring him a cup of Hamilton&#39;s prized coffee. His voice was cold, almost accusing. &#34;You&#39;re not the same as before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad nodded, echoing the sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, &#34;You never used to shut us out like this, Hamilton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan spoke up as well. &#34;This isn&#39;t what you promised our father when he handed things over to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt a cold emptiness settle in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry, mocking laugh escaped him. &#34;Funny how that works. When I bent over backwards for you, I was the family hero. Now that I&#39;m sick and can&#39;t keep up,suddenly I&#39;m the villain. Your standards sure change fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s irritation spiked. He raised his voice, clearly losing patience. &#34;Do you even know why we came?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What&#39;s with the attitude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s tone was measured. &#34;Remind me, Josh.Aren&#39;t you here to check on your ailing brother? Or is that not really the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Josh stumbled for an answer.&#34;Of course, that&#39;s part of it. But there&#39;s something else we need to discuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded slowly. &#34;So this visit is just a side errand, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face flushed with anger. &#34;There you go again,dripping with sarcasm. Did you learn that from Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton just sipped his coffee, unbothered by the remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s frown only deepened, tension lingering in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the strain in the room, Brad rushed to fill the silence. &#34;Hamilton, you might not realize just how much trouble the McCoy family is in right now.&#34;  But before Brad could explain, Hamilton cut in, &#34;Oh?Trouble, you say? Isn&#39;t it the leader&#39;s job to handle it?That&#39;s how it wworked when I ran things, wasn&#39;t it?Now that I&#39;ve stepped down, surely there&#39;s no reason to bring the trouble to my door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh had no answer for that. Neither did Brad, Jules,or Ethan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad scrambled for words.′′NO, that&#39;s not it at all.It&#39;s just that Daniela won&#39;t let up. She keeps coming after us...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stopped him with a dismissive wave. &#34;Look,I&#39;m not in charge anymore. It&#39;s pointless to dump this on me. Back when I was in charge, none of you ever concerned yourselves with the company&#39;s affairs.Now, I&#39;ll return the favor. I&#39;m not well, so don&#39;t expect me to play host today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh coüldn&#39;t muster a response. His brothers were just as speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan scratched his head awkwardly. &#34;It shouldn&#39;t be like this, Hamilton. Whether you&#39;re running things or not, we&#39;re all part of the McCoy family. When our father passed, he wanted us to stick together. And honestly, it&#39;s not outsiders stirring the pot. It&#39;s your son and daughter-in-law. If we step in, it&#39;ll just look like we&#39;re picking on the younger generation. People will talk. It really ought to come from you. Besides,we&#39;ve always liked Cedric; he&#39;s family. There&#39;s no sense in airing our dirty laundry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh wasted no time backing him up. &#34;Exactly,Hamilton. They&#39;re your kids. You&#39;re the one who should handle it. That&#39;s on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chimed in, &#34;This isn&#39;t something we can resolve without you. We need your guidance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added, &#34;Right. If his uncles interfere, Cedric might never forgive us. It&#39;ll only look like wve&#39;re out to make his life harder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their arguments were smooth, almost rehearsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hamilton wasn&#39;t about to let it slide. He looked at them with feigned surprise, voice sharp. &#34;You&#39;re calling Cedric your nephew now? Didn&#39;t you refuse to accept Cedric? Funny, coming from the same people who called him a bastard. behind my back and thought I&#39;d never hear about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s mouth opened and closed, searching for a comeback but coming up empty. The rest had nothing to say either.</p>
