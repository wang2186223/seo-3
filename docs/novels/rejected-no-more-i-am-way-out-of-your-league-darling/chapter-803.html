                <p>Daniela&#39;s words trailed off as she cast a fleeting glance at Hamilton, who stood silently to the side</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was light, almost indifferent, but beneath it lay an unmistakable undercurrent of menace, more felt than seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton felt the weight of her piercing gaze settle upon him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief moment, Daniela turned away, her coldness lingering in theair like an invisible frost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill she had cast upon him melted away,and Hamilton exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t quite understand why Daniela had said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then faced Nikolas, his voice sharp. &#34;What did Daniela mean by her words? What else are you managing outside McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered by the situation, Nikolas had no choice but to reveal the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face drained of color, his aged features trembling with a fury that threatened to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the son he had once held in the highest esteem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very same son he had chosen to inherit McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once told others,&#34;My sons may not be perfect,but their hearts are firmly with McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he felt a deep, cutting humiliation pierce his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sudden, dawning moment, Hamilton understood the cryptic smile Daniela wore as she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile seemed to tell him that what he valued most McCoy Group, its future heir, and the trust and hopes he had placed in his sons-had been irrevocably lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood still, his body frozen in shock as the realization hit him like a crushing wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas noticed the shock in Hamilton&#39;s eyes. Unease gnawed at him, but he knew this was no time for hesitation. &#34;Daniela will definitely go after my private assets.What should we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes hardened, his gaze turning cold and fierce. He strode to the window, his voice cold as ice as he issued a command to his loyal assassins. &#34;Guard that island with your lives. If anyone dares to threaten it,eliminate them-no matter who they are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was stunned, his gaze rising slowly to meet Hamilton&#39;s his face a mask of cold, unshakable resolve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that Hamilton had intended to kill Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is everything to Cedric. If anything happens to her, he will lose control completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that if anything happened to Daniela, Cedric would spiral into madness, far more uncontrollable than the chaos Daniela unleashed today-tenfold, or even a hundred times more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face remained cold as ice. &#34;What do you know? If someone can&#39;t be of use, they should be discarded.&#34; He was unwilling to let anyone,not even Daniela,defy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her new company was flourishing, and with Danielaat its helm, it could easily become a serious competitor to McCoy Group down the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s just a woman. If she&#39;s gone, another will take her place. No matter how deeply he feels for her, it&#39;s nothing more than a fleeting attachment. How deep could his feelings really go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was confident in his experience with such matters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once been infatuated with Cedric&#39;s mother but what did that matter now? At his elevated position,there was no woman beyond his reach. Why hold on to any one person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only value Cedric&#39;s mother held was that she bore him a son</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the cutthroat, emotionless world of high society what place was there for sentimentality? Such emotions were nothing but a joke!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had come to a conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s recent actions had made his capabilites undeniable to everyone. He possessed a sharp mind for decisions, unwavering control, and natural command. He was the perfect choice to lead McCoy Group forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s rebellion, in the end, was driven entirely by Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Daniela who gave him the strength to stand firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take Nikolas for example-as long as the island existed, Nikolas had a fallback. If the island was gone,Nikolas naturally had to obey him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, as long as Daniela was eliminated, Hamilton believed Cedric would become the docile son he had always wanted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t ask for much-just that Cedric would obey him the same way he did Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat on the bed,his mind unraveling Hamilton&#39;s thoughts with ease</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suggested, &#34;Why not try talking to Daniela? Being allies with her is far better than being adversaries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s ability to uncover even his most hidden secrets revealed just how formidable she truly was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Nikolas believed pushing Daniela any further would only lead to disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas added, &#34;I believe Cedric can&#39;t live without Daniela. If anything happens to her, he could drag the entire McCoy family down with him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spoken with Cedric countless times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew too well how cold he could be to others and how gentle he was with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela were taken from him, Cedric would surely lose control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you know?&#34; Hamilton scoffed, brushing off Nikolas&#39; words. &#34;Once he ascends to power, what won&#39;t he have? Even the most beautiful women will be at his feet. How could my sons afford to get caught up in romantic entanglements?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had no patience for such trivial matters.&#34;T0stop Daniela from gaining an advantage, come with me to your island and bring everything back&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39;s heart sank at his father&#39;s words, a deep wave of disappointment flooding him. Those were the fruits of his long years of effort. &#34;Could you spare a little for me? McCoy Group doesn&#39;t need these, does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his father genuinely saw Cedric as the heir, then overlooking his actions and leaving him a portion of his private wealth would have been the last act of goodwill toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep dreaming! Everything you own belongs to McCoy Group!&#34; Hamilton was unconcerned by the request. He understood human nature all too well,particularly when it came to men-money sparked endless ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was precisely why he maintained tight control over the finances of every son of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His goal was clear-to keep them in check and ensure their obedience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was also Hamilton securing the path for Cedric&#39;s eventual rule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this moment, he stood with a smug expression, thoroughly satisfied with himself.</p>
