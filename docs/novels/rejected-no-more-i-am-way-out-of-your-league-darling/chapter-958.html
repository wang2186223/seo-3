                <p>Never in his wildest dreams did Ethan imagine that handing out money would be simple, but getting it back would feel impossible</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a strained grin. Ethan tried his luck. &#34;Josh, I know this sounds sudden, but there&#39;s something urgent at home and I really need the cash. Can you return what you owe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frosty look replaced Josh&#39;s usual charm as he stubbed out his cigarette. &#34;Oh? Something urgent?What&#39;s going on at home?&#34; He lounged back on the sofa, not even pretending to be friendly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan mumbled, &#34;It&#39;s really important, Josh. Please,could you just give it back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not budging an inch. Josh took a slow drag and exhaled wvithout a hint of sympathy. &#34;That money&#39;s already been put into the company. It&#39;s out of my hands now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught Ethan completely off guard.&#34;That doesn&#39;t make sense. I spoke with your secretary, and she said you haven&#39;t even been to the office today.Besides,you never brought in a lawyer or had me sign anything. How could it already be invested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s demeanor grew harsher. &#34;If I tell you it&#39;s invested, then it&#39;s invested. Do you think I&#39;m lying to you? Let&#39;s be honest-you&#39;re probably the one making things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s nerves betrayed him, his gaze dropping for a moment. &#34;Look, investments are supposed to be voluntary, right? I&#39;m not interested in this anymore.Please, just return my money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining stone-faced, Josh replied, &#34;You gave me the money yourself. I didn&#39;t steal it from you. You think just because we&#39;re family, I&#39;ll go easy on you and listen to these stories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, Ethan&#39;s determination only grew stronger..&#34;Maybe we can work something out. I know I put money into the business before, but I want out. Could you tally things up and give me back whatever&#39;s left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Family ties, Ethan thought, ought to count for something. It was just one afternoon. Even if there were some minor losses, it shouldn&#39;t add up to much.Getting the bulk of it back was all he needed. Losing a bit to Josh wouldn&#39;t sting, after all, they were related.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the answer he received took him by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a rare note of understanding in his voice, Josh .said, &#34;Sure, we can do that.&#34; Ethan&#39;s face brightened. &#34;Really? Then..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A raised hand stopped him. &#34;Just so you know,the money&#39;s tied up in a project now. If you pull out,you&#39;ll lose a chunk of it I&#39;m just looking out for you.Are you sure you want to go through with this, Ethan?Wouldn&#39;t you rather give it a second thought?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not necessary, Josh. I&#39;m done. Please just give me back what you can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s features hardened the moment Ethan refused to back down. A cold sneer formed on his lips as he pulled out his phone and rang the finance department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the door swung open to reveal Josh&#39;s daughter,,the newly minted financial manager,calculator in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes flicking over the screen, she punched in a few numbers, then pushed up her glasses and fixed Ethan with a knowing look. &#34;Uncle Ethan, you wired 28.5billion into the company&#39;s account earlier, After a few hours and all the standard deductions. I&#39;ll arrange a transfer of three million right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock swept over Ethan, leaving him reeling. Putting that much money in a regular savings account would&#39;ve earned him more than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s got to be a mistake,right?&#34; Ethan fought to keep his expression pleasant。 even though every muscle in his face threatened to betray what he truly felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could nearly thirty billion, handled by Josh for one afternoon, turn into three million?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh, this isn&#39;t right,&#34; Ethan said, his voice strained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh just shrugged. &#34;You&#39;re the one who wanted out.I tried to tell you to let the investment grow.Since you&#39;re my brother, I&#39;m doing you a favor by giving anything back at all. Anyone else would have walked away with nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked Ethan&#39;s eyes, fury building inside him.&#34;Don&#39;t do this, Josh. I deserve what&#39;s mine. You know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Josh inhaled deeply on his cigarette,remaining silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing his pride, Ethan pleaded, &#34;We&#39;re family.Please, don&#39;t make this ugly. Let&#39;s compromise.Give me twenty billion and keep the rest. I won&#39;t ask for more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth finally settled in for Ethan. Whatever Josh&#39;s reputation in business, nobody could outdohim when it came to taking advantage of his own brothers. He had no heart at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it. Take the three million or leave the money in and become a shareholder. The choice is yours.&#34;said Josh,stubbing out his cigarette and heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at Josh&#39;s retreating back, Ethan shouted,&#34;Stop right there! You owe me an explanation, and I&#39;m not letting you walk away from this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clawed at Ethan&#39;s chest. With Josh&#39;s talent for exploiting family, any chance of getting his money back would vanish if he let Josh leave now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation took over. Ethan lunged,grabbing Josh by the collar, his voice ragged. &#34;Don&#39;t walk away! You know my family isn&#39;t wealthy like yours. If you refuse,I swear I won&#39;t let this go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing Josh expected was for Ethan to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A struggle erupted between the two brothers,neither willing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An emergency call brought Hamiltonracing to the hospital, only to find Ethan and Josh in the middle of a heated exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each of them ended up with a broken arm, the evidence of their ordeal plain to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan even lost a front tooth,looking both ridiculous and pitiful.Hamilton could only gape. &#34;What in the world are you two doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With red eyes. Ethan turned to him and admitted.&#34;Hamilton, I owe you an apology. Alll this time.I blamed you, but today. I finally know who the real villain is,&#34;</p>
