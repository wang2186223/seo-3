                <p>Egan watched the whole exchange unfold, then said with a raised brow, &#34;Is Nikolas interested in someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled, trying to brush it off. &#34;That can&#39;t be. He just helped a girl once or twice. Now she&#39;s tagging along like he&#39;s some kind of savior. She even showed up here. Honestly, does she even realize what kind of place this is? I suppose those from lesser backgrounds just don&#39;t grasp how things work in circles like ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egan gave a slight nod. &#34;Nikolas is impressive, that&#39;s for sure. But why did it look like he was chasing her just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible. Mr. Rowe, you must be joking.Nikolas would never fall for someone like her.&#34;Hamilton then turned to Calliope Rowe, Egan&#39;s daughter. &#34;If he were to have feelings for anyone, it would be someone like Calliope. Refined, educated,elegant...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Egan laughed at that, but his amusement quickly faded.He had just caught sight of the same girl Hamilton had criticized moments earlier. She stepped out of the kitchen,holding a takeout bag, clearly about to leave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And once again, Nikolas rose from his seat and followed her from behind. He leaned down slightly to speak to her, his voice low. &#34;Where are you headed?Let me give you a lift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression turned grim in an instant</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, who had spotted Calliope seated nearby,exchanged a polite nod with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Nikolas and said, &#34;If you&#39;re here for dinner, kindly return to your table. If not,please stop bothering the guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was cold. Nikolas felt a sting in his chest.&#34;Let me take you home,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol could hardly believe it. There he was, sitting across from a girl on a date, yet he had the nerve to say something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she motioned to the security. They stepped in to block Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the takeout bag in hand, Carol walked toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas brushed past the guards and chased after her.&#34;Carol, wait. Let me explain. This wasn&#39;t my idea. My father arranged it. I didn&#39;t even want to be here. If you hadn&#39;t shown up, I would&#39;ve told her I have a girl I like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol opened the car door without replying and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas caught up and slipped inside before she could stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton reached the front just in time to see Nikolas sitting beside her. He rushed forward, yelling, &#34;Nikolas,get out of that car!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked at Hamilton, then turned to Carol&#39;s unmoved profile. &#34;Let&#39;s just go,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;ll deal with him later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to Nikolas. &#34;WVhat on earth is wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out and said to Hamilton, &#34;Get your son out of my car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared after her, stunned. He hadn&#39;t expected her to be that cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hamilton dragged his son out, Carol got back in,hit the gas, and sped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Egan and Calliope stepped outside and saw everything. Nikolas gave a quick bow, apologizing.&#34;I&#39;m sorry you had to witness that. My father arranged this meeting. But the truth is, I&#39;m already fond of someone.The one who just left. She&#39;s not some ordinary girl.She&#39;s remarkable. Really, she is. She&#39;s so amazing l honestly don&#39;t think I deserve her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at home, Daniela was enjoying the food from the restaurant when Hamilton burst in, clearly fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spotted the takeout box and grew even more upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t you manage your people better?&#34; he snapped. Daniela raised an eyebrow and.replied, &#34;Isn&#39;t your son the one who can&#39;t behave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing at the box, he said, &#34;Carol followed us to the restaurant. Everything was going fine until she barged in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked down at the label, then said evenly,&#34;This restaurant? It&#39;s mine. I&#39;m giving it to Carol as a gift. Why can&#39;t she be there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked. His mind froze for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same pressure he always felt around Daniela came flooding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re serious? That restaurant belongs to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even glance up. &#34;Elite Lux owns it.Carol manages it. I plan to sign it over to her eventually. Does that answer your question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a sigh and rubbed his temples.&#34;That&#39;s not what I meant. I&#39;m asking what you think about Nikolas and Carol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My thoughts? They can date whoever they want. But Carol said she&#39;s not interested anymore. She asked him to stop hanging around. It&#39;s making her look bad. She still needs to meet a decent man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked at her, dumbfounded. &#34;So Nikolas is the one being desperate now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a dry blink. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&#34; Right as the words left her mouth, Carol entered the room, her expression unreadable. Nikolas trailed behind, looking desperate. &#34;Carol, please hear me out.You misunderstood. My father&#39;s right here. He can back me up. I told the Rowe family everything. I told them I like you. Dad, come on. Say something. Carol&#39;s taking this the wrong way.&#34;</p>
