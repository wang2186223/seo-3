                <p>The mocking laughter from inside the restaurant echoed in Caiden&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smug grin faded in an instant, replaced by a stormy expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he considered walking away, but after a few hesitant steps, he spun around and marched back inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open with a loud thud, silencing the chatter as heads turned his way. Caiden scanned the room before confidently claiming a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologies for being late, everyone,&#34; he began, his voice dripping with exaggerated politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people in the restaurant exchanged amused looks. Caiden began, &#34;Daniela insisted on getting me a new outfit. I told her something from Elite Lux would do,but she wouldn&#39;t hear of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging at his collared shirt, he added, &#34;Just look at this. Pure wool. Set her back fifty grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a trace of embarrassment crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing briefly, he launched into more boasting.&#34;She also promised to take me on a trip this holiday.Bought her own private island, you know? You probably saw it in the news. Once it&#39;s ready, she&#39;ll fly me out personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, everyone couldn&#39;t help but marvel at Caiden&#39;s luck in having such an extraordinary daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they felt a hint of envy, there was nothing they could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Daniela was undeniably remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the world&#39;s richest woman, her wealth was beyond comprehension. Even if Caiden lived  recklessly, just a small portion of her fortune was enough to ensure a lifetime of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While their compliments flowed freely, jealousy simmered beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden soaked up their flattery, reveling in a swell of pride and self-importance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than holding back, he leaned into his bragging even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not even old enough to retire yet, but Daniela insists on giving me a monthly allowance. I told her it wasn&#39;t necessary, but she wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. In fact, this month&#39;s payment should come through today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking out his phone, he began recording a brief video for Daniela, ensuring the group was in full view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey Daniela, I&#39;m out with some friends you&#39;ve met before,&#34; he said, panning the camera to capture the group, who eagerly waved and smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them light up at the opportunity to impress  the world&#39;s wealthiest woman, Caiden smirked in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving closer to the window, he lowered his voice and spoke with a sly smile. &#34;Send over that allowance now, and while you&#39;re at it, cover this dinner for me.Help me make an impression here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed send and caught a few curious, slightly skeptical glances from the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring them, he grinned and settled back in his seat, placing his phone on the table like a trophy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was eagerly waiting for the bank notification,ready to show it off once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he waited, someone chuckled and asked, &#34;So,Caiden, with your daughter being the richest woman alive, how big is that monthly allowance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, every pair of eyes around the table turned to Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden soaked in the attention, giving a modest smile before replying, &#34;Well, It&#39;s decent.&#34; The truth was, he  had no idea how much Daniela would give him, so he couldn&#39;t afford to overdo the boasting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m practically retired now, so I don&#39;t really need much. My daughter always says her money is there for me. She takes care of all the bills at home and even reimburses anything I spend elsewhere. She keeps reminding me not to stress about money at my age and just enjoy life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he finished speaking, his phone buzzed on the table. Caiden&#39;s face brightened instantly as he grabbed his phone and held it uup for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this. Another transfer. Daniela&#39;s covering today&#39;s food and drinks. Thanks for the company,everyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He unlocked his phone and proudly displayed the transaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group leaned in eagerly for a closer look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of superiority washed over Caiden as he savored the attention. But the moment he saw the glaring figure of two thousand, his smug grin vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others exchanged quick glances, then leaned back in their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden let out a forced laugh. &#34;Ah, she must&#39;ve just sent enough to cover our meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Daniela&#39;s audio message arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping for a lifeline, Caiden quickly pressed play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice filled the room, sharp and clear. &#34;I&#39;m sending you four months of your basic allowance,that&#39;s five hundred a month. That should keep you quiet for a while. And Caiden, if you&#39;re inviting people out, the bill is yours. Have you forgotten your place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message ended abruptly, and a heavy silence followed. Then, suddenly, a burst of laughter erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some wiped tears from their eyes, others held their sides in laughter, and a few were doubled over,barely holding onto their seats. Caiden&#39;s face burned with humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot up from his chair, stiff as a board, and bolted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mockery behind him only intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even outside, he could still hear their laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That shirt&#39;s ancient. He really thought we&#39;d believe Daniela bought it for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when he tried whispering for more money by the window? I nearly died!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, right? He thought no one heard him,but he was the biggest joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All he did was name-drop Daniela. Bet she doesn&#39;t even care about him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? Secondhand embarrassment hit me so hard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jeering voices behind him cut through his pride like daggers. Overcome with shame, Caiden kept his head dlown,unable to meet anyone&#39;s gaze.</p>
