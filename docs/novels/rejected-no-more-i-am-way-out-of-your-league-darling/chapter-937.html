                <p>Brad flicked his hand like he was shooing away a fly.&#34;What does Daniela know anyway? She&#39;s just a pregnant woman. What could she possibly figure out? She&#39;s spouting nonsense, and you actually believed her? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re that gullible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan didn&#39;t care to chime in. All he could think about was the pain throbbing in his mangled finger.&#34;Damn that Daniela. So protective. One day, I&#39;ll make her pay for this finger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; eyes drifted to the villa, then dropped to the empty paper in his hands. A restless feeling stirred in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jules neared the gate, he leaned close to his right-hand man and whispered, &#34;Get some eyes on Josh. Find out what he&#39;s really doing these days.&#34; The man beside him paused, blinking hard. &#34;You actually trust what Daniela hinted? You think Josh is hiding something? If he catches wind of this, he&#39;ll blow up for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Then don&#39;t let him find out.Daniela&#39;s not the type to speak for nothing.Check it all. I want peace of mind. Also, dig into McCoy Group&#39;s books and watch for any strange money moves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His right-hand man dipped his head. &#34;Understood,Mr. McCoy. I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Jules&#39; shoulders drop a little. He headed inside,ready to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the house grew quiet, the right-hand man slipped out the back, found a dark corner, and called a number. &#34;MAr. McCoy, just as you guessed. Jules is suspicious after Daniela opened her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s calm voice came through. &#34;Then you know what comes next.&#34; Of course. I&#39;ll keep blaming Daniela for everything.But do you think she actually caught on to something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft silence lingered before Josh answered, &#34;Doubt it. I&#39;ve covered my tracks well. She&#39;s pregnant. What does she see? Probably just a lucky guess. Let it go.Keep Jules calm. I&#39;ll take care of the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh asked, &#34;Did they stop by to see Daniela today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,they did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh let out a cold laugh. &#34;And they didn&#39;t show up empty-handed, did they?&#34; He knew his family too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice on the line answered, &#34;They sure didn&#39;t.Brad brought poisoned ginseng. Jules slipped in a baby doll with a hidden camera. Ethan handed over some supplements. If Daniela swallows even one pill,her baby won&#39;t last an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s grin grew sharp. &#34;My dear brothers never disappoint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, Josh asked, &#34;Did you deliver everything I ordered?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all in place. The villa is locked down for now, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Our men disguised as sanitation workers cover every corner around the estate. No move from the will slip by us. I&#39;ll update you if anything stirs. Also, we&#39;ve treated the flowers and plants with a slow poison. Every time Daniela passes through, she breathes it in. Even if she carries to term,that baby won&#39;t be healthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh chuckled, voice icy. &#34;I expect good news soon.&#34;He ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, back in his room, Jules watched the feeds showing Daniela&#39;s movements. A knock pulled him from the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, we ran the checks. McCoy Group&#39;s accounts look steady. The stock price keeps dropping sharply, but otherwise there&#39;s nothing strange. As for Josh, his money flow is clean. Same</p>
                
                
                
                <p>old spending, same routines. We also tracked him around town. Other than working late at the office and visiting his usual restaurants, nothing stands out.And with the stock crashing, he&#39;s been staying at the company past three in the morning, working nonstop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded again and again. &#34;Josh really is giving it his all. I knew Daniela was trying to distract me.I shouldn&#39;t have doubted my big brother over her words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of guilt pressed on him. He vowed right then -no matter what came next, Josh would always have his loyalty.</p>
