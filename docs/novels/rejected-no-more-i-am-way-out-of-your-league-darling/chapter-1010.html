                <p>Daniela stepped outside into the courtyard to take a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was about to step inside, she saw Cedric,his hands full of lemons he&#39;d just plucked from the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pregnancy had given her a relentless craving for all things sour,and Cedric knew exactly what to bring her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing one of the lemons, Daniela lifted it to her nose,breathing in the crisp, tart aroma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the frot door swung wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood there, visibly tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to ask what was wrong when a subtle, metallic tang crept into her senses-a faint trace of blood lingering in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the lemon hung motionless in Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to slow as she traded a loaded glance with Cedric. Both of them felt the tension sharpen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not hesitating, Daniela slipped into the house and found the housekeeper busy in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An impulse to investigate pulled Cedric toward the source of the scent, but Daniela caught his arm,holding him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look passed between them. Daniela&#39;s knuckles whitened around the lemon, its sour fragrance now mixed with the sinister smell fillng the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t do anything for him now,&#34; she murmured.&#34;It&#39;s been too long-over thirty minutes at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s concern wasn&#39;t for the victim,only that something so grim had happened here, in their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bad luck seemed to haunt their doorstep today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leading Cedric toward the couch, Daniela tried to brush off the gravity. &#34;It&#39;s already done. With blood like that, there&#39;s no hope. Let&#39;s see how he gets himself out of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words had just faded when Hamilton came in,wrinkling his nose at the air. &#34;What&#39;s that smell? It&#39;s awful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Daniela, Hamilton&#39;s attention shifted away from the stench. &#34;Daniela, are you really just going to let this go? Nikolas refuses to eat or drink. If this keeps up, he&#39;ll waste away. What should I do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing open the floor-to-ceiling window, Hamilton Let in a gust of air and grumbled at the housekeeper,&#34;Did you use too much disinfectant? This smell is strange-or maybe that mop hasn&#39;t been rinsed out properly.&#34; The housekeeper shook her head. &#34;No, I didn&#39;t use any disinfectant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing, she took a deep sniff, trying to trace the odor. &#34;Maybe there&#39;s some construction happening nearby. The air does carry a bit of something odd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, she grabbed her mop and disappeared into the bathroom, determined to wipe the floor down once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the lingering scent faded after her efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Hamilton ask Daniela again, &#34;So, what are you going to do about Nikolas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his gaze flickered to Carol, who stood by,unmoved by the chaos, as if none of it concerned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiling over, Hamilton pointed at Carol.&#34;That idiot&#39;s starving himself for your sake. Are you just going to ignore him? Do you care at all, or is this just his hopeless crush?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of anger brewed in Hamilton&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this how the McCoy men were fated-to chase after Daniela&#39;s approval or suffer for her whims?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really all their lives amounted to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury left Hamilton breathless, his chest rising and falling sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Carol replied, &#34;I do like Nikolas. But you were the one who said we&#39;re not a good match,right?Since he&#39;s moved on and is seeing someone else,why should I feel guilty? I&#39;m loyal to those who belong to me. If he isn&#39;t mine, I don&#39;t owe him anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had always been a chill about Carol, as if warmth had never found a place in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years beside Daniela had taught Carol to be icy and ruthless, both to herself and others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence shaped every word, leaving no doubt about her stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his mounting frustration, Hamilton couldn&#39;t muster a comeback, left searching for words that wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden creak broke the tension as the door to Brad&#39;s room swung open and Brad stepped into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave Brad a sideways look. &#34;You&#39;re showering in the middle of the day? And you didn&#39;t even bother to dry your hair. Is that cologne I smell?Seriously, how much did you use? The whole room reeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running the towel through his hair, Brad shrugged. &#34;It was hot, so I jumped in for a quick rinse. Couldn&#39;t find the hairdryer.Anyway,Hamilton,what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; situation was on the tip of Hamilton&#39;s tongue,but embarrassment made him change the subject. His attention drifted around the room. &#34;Has anyone seenEthan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple question brought everything to a standstill-Brad stopped mid-motion, towel frozen above his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, he met a wall of stares from Daniela,.Cedric, and Carol. Daniela&#39;s gaze lingered longest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her eyes-cool, sharp, just a hint of mockery-sent a chill through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what story he came up with, Brad felt completely exposed under her scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shaky smile surfaced.&#34;What&#39;s with the intense looks?Don&#39;t ask me about Ethan, I have no clue where he went.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerves flickered in his eyes as he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt creased Hamilton&#39;s brow as he pulled out his phone. &#34;You&#39;re sure? Ethan invited me over, said he had news. Now he&#39;s vanished. What&#39;s he up to? I&#39;ll just call and check.&#34;</p>
