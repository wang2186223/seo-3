                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pick my own partner!&#34; With those words, Nina turned and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse spent a small fortune hiring a skilled hypnotist to hypnotize Linden that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina made her way back to the Harper family villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela was lounging and watching a TV show when Nina came up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to get married, but I want the ceremony to take place here. Would that be okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Nina a thoughtful look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina went on, &#34;If the ceremony takes place in my mom&#39;s, my mom will take everything herself. I&#39;ll get nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated before asking, &#34;Why would | agree to that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lowered her voice. &#34;I have a secret. Help me,and I&#39;ll tell you what I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice turned grave. &#34;It&#39;s about your mother&#39;s death. You&#39;ve always suspected my mother had something to do with it and she&#39;s not alone in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, with Daniela&#39;s influence, Elyse wouldn&#39;t have been able to get this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can tell you who&#39;s supporting her. But first, I need your help with my favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled lightly. &#34;Is this how you plan to repay me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina pressed her lips together before sinking to her knees. &#34;I&#39;m the one who&#39;s neglected at home. You&#39;ve  gone through something similar at the Harper family.Please, just help me one more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat cross-legged on the sofa, letting the TV show hum on in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain softly tapped against the windows outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by the rain and the sound of her own pounding heartbeat, Nina heard Daniela finally say,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s heart leapt in her chest. This was the best outcome she could have hoped for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head in gratitude. &#34;&#39;Thank you. I&#39;ll never forget your kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian presented Nina with several potential husbands-decent, stable candidates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nina selected a man with a rather average appearance, who also had a physical disability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave Nina a quick glance before turning to Daniela. &#34;You have a unique outlook, Nina. Sammy Wesker may have physical challenges, but he&#39;s made over a hundred million. Looks like you know what&#39;s more important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were cutting. But Nina didn&#39;t take offense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was saying Nina was only after the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian departed, Daniela said calmly, &#34;Marriage is a significant decision. Once you&#39;re in, you can&#39;t undo it. If none of these men feel right, take your time. The Harper family villa has plenty of rooms for you to stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s eyes filled with tears. &#34;Don&#39;t you think I&#39;m just being money-hungry by choosing Sammy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained emotionless. &#34;How you choose is your choice. When you decide to rely on someone for a lifetime, you need to choose carefully to gain a stable and long-lasting relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina smiled faintly. &#34;You&#39;re always so wise.&#34; She gave a bitter laugh. &#34;I know I don&#39;t have your abilities.l can&#39;t rely on my own skills to protect myself, so l look for support. If my mother thinks I could settle for someone like Linden, surely she won&#39;t mind a son-in-law with a limp. Besides, Sammy&#39;s social standing and abilities outshine Elyse&#39;s. If I marry him, Elyse won&#39;t dare send me to Linden. I know you&#39;ll protect me, but it&#39;s time for me to take control of my future.I need to grow up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when Nina went to try on wedding dresses that Elyse heard the news-Nina was getting married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse hurried to Daniela&#39;s side. &#34;Daniela,what is this?Nina&#39;s getting married, and I&#39;m the last to know? This isn&#39;t right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had already secured a marriage for Nina with an 88-year-old man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had sold Nina for a hefty price. But now, the man was demanding a refund.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Daniela replied, glancing at the paperwork.&#34;I&#39;m curious too. Why are you the last to know about Nina&#39;s marriage? Aren&#39;t you her mother?&#34; Elyse seethed with anger as she made her way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she saw Daniela, her fury quickly subdued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest rising and falling with anger, she demanded coldly, &#34;And how is it that I hear Nina&#39;s wedding is being held at the Harper family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sammy had a respectable social standing, so the dowry would surely be substantial. If Elyse secured it, Natalie&#39;s future would leave everyone envious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Nina married outside the Harper family, those benefits wouldn&#39;t go to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing off to the side, fidgeted. &#34;Mom, we can&#39;t let Nina marry Sammy! What will I do if Linden needs a woman later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was always fixated on her own concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse found Nina and snapped, &#34;You can&#39;t be this selfish. Go tell Daniela you&#39;re not marrying him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she pulled Nina towards Daniela.</p>
