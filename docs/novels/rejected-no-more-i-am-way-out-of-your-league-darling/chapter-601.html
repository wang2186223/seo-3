                <p>Huey had no clue what Daniela was planning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to alert the wrong people, he made his way back to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he left, he spotted security guards stationed around his house. It reassured him and made him even more grateful to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was just like her mother-kind and unwaveringly reliable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, Huey called over the other members of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was his earlier timid attitude. Now he carried himself with a commanding confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marcus is dead. What&#39;s your take on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett strolled in last, just in time to hear Huey&#39;s words. He narrowed his eyes, confused by Huey&#39;s shift from a jittery wreck to someone radiating boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung back, silently studying Huey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno spoke up first. &#34;Cedric had a damn good point the other day-Daniela had no reason to kill Marcus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp nodded. &#34;Exactly. Daniela already won this whole corporate war. What would she gain from taking out Marcus? Besides, she&#39;s got the same fire as her mom-she&#39;s too sharp for low-level moves like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley nodded in agreement. &#34;Couldn&#39;t have said it better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey met Hackett&#39;s lingering gaze and held it. &#34;What about you, Hackett? Any theories on how Marcus ended up dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett barely flinched. Drowning in debt, he had no energy to care about this mess. Marcus&#39; death didn&#39;t put a dent in Daniela&#39;s world, and he had no interest in the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No idea,&#34; Hackett muttered, dragging a chair over and slumping into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey glanced at him, his voice casual but pointed. &#34;Then who do you think did it? Someone lured Marcus out late at night. And he wasn&#39;t the type to leave his place for just anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Huey spoke, he and Farley exchanged a knowing glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett caught the glance, his expression darkening. &#34;Listen, it wasn&#39;t me, alright? I&#39;ve got bigger problems.Talk all you want, but leave me out of these pointless meetings. He&#39;s dead. End of story. I&#39;m not wasting another damn second on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Hackett was out of earshot, Huey leaned back and said coolly, &#34;Wasn&#39;t Hackett all worked up about this just a few days ago? Why the sudden cold shoulder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley smirked. &#34;You were stuck in the hospital, so you missed the show. Hackett swept in and took over every single one of Marcus&#39; companies-left his family with nothing. Cold-blooded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey scanned the group, noting their furrowed brows, then casually dropped a bombshell. &#34;Crazy, isn&#39;t it?Decades of friendship, and Hackett still went this low. You think you know someone, but you never really do.If I&#39;d fallen off that building, you can bet my fortune would be long gone. Hackett? He&#39;s a loaded gun with no safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group&#39;s frowns deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was low, even for Hackett,&#34; Bruno muttered, his voice like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley jumped in. &#34;Exactly! It&#39;s one thing if an outsider takes over, but one of us? Like some rabid dog?That&#39;s just disgusting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey sighed, rubbing his temples.&#34;Glad we&#39;re on the same page. Hackett talks smooth, but behind the scenes? Who knows how ruthless he really is? If I&#39;d seen this coming, I never would&#39;ve dealt with Brylee.Dealing with Hackett just feels dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, isn&#39;t there a new president of the association now? Maybe we should push Alexander to kick Hackett out. What do you guys think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group hesitated, old loyalties clashing with cold reality. Huey shrugged. &#34;I&#39;m done with Hackett. The day I nearly fell? If Cedric hadn&#39;t grabbed me, I&#39;d be a smear on the pavement. Trust Hackett again? Might as well write my own death sentence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gawked at Huey. &#34;Wait, you said Cedric was the one who nearly got you killed that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was scared out of my mind,&#34; Huey admitted. &#34;Hackett looked ready to kill. I was weak, defenseless. If he&#39;d made a move, I was done. And my family? Cross Hackett, and we&#39;re all finished. You really think I want to end up like Marcus?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group was stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they filed out, the decision was unanimous-Alexander had to get rid of Hackett, and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the others left, Farley came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes at Huey, who was sprawled on the bed, peeling an orange.&#34;You&#39;re way too relaxed.A few days ago, you looked like you&#39;d seen a ghost. Andyou said your family had no one watching their back.Now you&#39;re spilling your guts like you&#39;ve got nothing to lose. What changed? Someone&#39;s protecting your family,aren&#39;t they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey just kept eating his orange, unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley leaned in, his gazesharp. &#34;Daniela is the one protecting you and your family, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
