                <p>Elyse breathed a sigh of relief as soon as Daniela gave her a favorable response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood off to the side, his brow knitted in a cold.penetrating stare at Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained composed. &#34;Since it&#39;s a promise made by my mother. I will honor it. But for the continued success of Elite Lux, I do have one condition I hope you&#39;ll accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was ecstatic, already counting her benefits in her mind. Daniela&#39;s directness made her regret not asking for even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Go on,&#34; Elyse agreed quickly. She had set three demands, and Daniela only had one: it felt like a fair deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled lightly. &#34;Elite Lux is a global corporation. A ten percent shift in shares could stir external turmoil, so l need you to keep this confidential. Only those in this office should be aware.If not, the gift will be revoked. Do we have an agreement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded eagerly. &#34;Of course!&#34; After a moment.she asked. &#34;What about Nina and Natalie? Can I tell them?&#34; Daniela shook her head. &#34;No. If that&#39;s the case, the agreement is null. Everything I&#39;ve promised will be rescinded, and you alone will bear the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse hesitated. &#34;But Nina and Natalie are my daughters. If you don&#39;t trust Nina, can I at least tell Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft chuckle. Her smile was slight but sharp. &#34;I don&#39;t quite get it. The recording from my mother spoke of ensuring your retirement care. Why bring others into this? Or should I be responsible for Nina and Natalie as well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was on the verge of agreeing when Daniela shook her head. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, I don&#39;t have to honor my mother&#39;s promise. It was her commitment to you,and Elite Lux is mine. If you have future needs,you can access funds from Harper Group&#39;s accounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t wvork.&#34; Elyse panicked. &#34;Harper Group is in shambles,losing money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse understood that Daniela was waiting for her to make a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The decision involved hundreds of billions in assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was greatly tempted, and after a moment, she nodded. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;I&#39;ll draw up an agreement.&#34;it honor vour retirement nlans, but if vou disclose anu details to others, the agreement will be void.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse quickly signed the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile softened as she spoke to Elyse. &#34;Have you heard the saying? Secrets always find their way out. If you share anything, I&#39;ll know. I trust you&#39;ll keep your word and enjoy your retirement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded enthusiastically and asked, &#34;When will the retirement home be ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;The land in the city is going up for bid soon, I&#39;ll place a bid, and that&#39;s where the retirement home will be constructed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face brightened. &#34;It should bear my name.Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded. &#34;No problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse walked out, smiling broadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, from the secretarial department, noticed Elyse&#39;s wide grin and felt puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked Lillian, who sighed, her face creased with irritation,and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then asked Cedric, whose face was clouded with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was dying of curiosity. She longed to ask Daniela but knew she was always busy. While she was delivering documents to the office, she overheard Daniela telling Ryan, &#34;Put these three documents the safe. They&#39;re vital for Elite Lux&#39;s future, and no one else should see them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was distracted, playing a new game on his phone.the sharp sounds of gunfire blaring from the screen.He seemed lost in the game as he absentmindedly responded to Daniela,&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela then exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie observed that even after Daniela walked away.she kept turning back, glancing cautiously over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela left, the office felI silent and empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Ryan remained, lounging and absorbed in his game, while Natalie cautiously approached Daniola&#39;s desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the papers down and stretched her neck to peek at the documents on the desk across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one quick glance, she spotted Elyse&#39;s name listed as Party B. Daniela was listed as Party A.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s pulse quickened as her eyes landed on the bold title above their names. Equity Transfer Agreement</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her in an instant-Daniela had transferred Elite Lux&#39;s shares to her mother. Elite Lux was a leading name in the global luxury industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had transferred shares to her mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was exhilarated. She squinted and spotted two more agreements beneath,though they were covered,leaving their contents unclear. Yet Elyse&#39;s name stood out clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else had Daniela given her mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; As Natalie was about to tiptoe closer for a better look, Ryan suddenly approached, phone in one hand, unlocking the safe with the other, and placing the three agreements inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked up at Ryan and asked, &#34;Did Ms. Harper sign any agreements with my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie noticed that Ryan&#39;s finger stilled on the screen after her question. &#34;No,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief moment made Natalie suspicious-there was something going on for sure. There had to be something fishy going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity was burning, and she couldn&#39;t wait to call Elyse right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! Did Daniela give you shares in Elite Lux?&#34; she  asked, her voice trembling with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had assumed Elyse would confess right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was a long silence on the other end of the line.</p>
