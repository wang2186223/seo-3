                <p>Cedric paused on the staircase, his gaze icy and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When Daniela was left to fend for herself, did any of you consider stepping in to save her? Joyce still has your support, but back then, Daniela had nobody.Her family showed less compassion than mere strangers. Daniela was once vibrant and spirited. Do you realize what crushed her spirit, leaving her so numbed by pain she can no longer even weep? It was you.Every single one of you. And now, you&#39;ve earned every bit of this miserable downfall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had always perceived Cedric as devoid of emotion, a fixture of stoic detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, in that fleeting moment, she glimpsed a fierce hatred blazing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down her spine. Without another word, Cedric&#39;s stoic mask returned as he turned and disappeared into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Alexander gave Joyce eight million dollars,Bennett Group&#39;s accounts dwindled to a mere few hundred dollars, driving Richard to such a peak of fury that it landed him in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander left the hospital and headed straight for Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His concern for Daniela weighed heavily on his mnind,compelling him to remind her of what happened on the rooftop that day, though weeks had passed since the incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his arrival at Elite Lux, Alexander found Daniela absorbed in a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her secretary guided him to Daniela&#39;s office, they passed the glass-walled conference room and Alexander saw Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She commanded the room from the center, her figure accentuated by the sleek lines of her tailored suit, the epitome of elegance and professionalism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she projected data onto the screen, her voice resonated with a confidence that captured the undivided attention of the senior executives encircling her. They scribbled notes fervently,hanging on her every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the secretary interjected,obstructing Alexander&#39;s view as she addressed him.&#34;Mr.Bennett, this way,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander trailed behind her into a well-appointed office and took a seat as instructed. &#34;Ms. Harper is tied up in a meeting. She&#39;ll be another hour. Please,make yourself comfortable,&#34; she informed him before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded with a silent nod, his thoughts drifting back to a time when the roles were reversed,and it was Daniela who had waited for him in his office at Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office at Elite Lux was an expansive space,marrying functionality with aesthetic appeal through its minimalist design. A gentle floral scent hung in the air, soothing and subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, aware that Daniela never wore perfume,noticed a flowering gardenia plant perched on a nearby desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, returning briefly, stated, &#34;That was a gift from Mr. Phillips. He tends to it personally,and as you can see, it&#39;s thriving. It seems the environment here nurtures both plants and people alike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled, excused herself, and promised to return shortly with a cup of coffee for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time passed slowly, and over an hour later, Daniela emerged from her meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary had already informed her that Alexander was waiting in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Daniela asked, wasting no time on pleasantries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something important I need to tell you,&#34;Alexander replied. The secretary closed the door behind her, leaving them to their private conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, methodically signing documents as she conversed. &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina is scheming behind your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Daniela responded in a tone that bordered on disinterest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s anxiety was palpable. &#34;Absolutely.Remember the incident on the rooftop? Katrina led you there. The winds were fierce that day-it&#39;s evident she had ill intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Briefly lifting her eyes to meet his, Daniela asked,&#34;Are you suggesting she intended for me to fall off the roof?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Alexander affirmed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning her gaze to the documents, Daniela asked,&#34;And your basis for this claim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression turned to one of confusion, revealing his inner turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since I cut my ties with Caiden, my assets are no longer intertwined with his. What reason could Katrina possibly have to target me? Merely out of spite? Alexander, do you honestly believe that spite is enough to justify attempted murder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Alexander struggled to find his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time Daniela countered with her poised, logical arguments, he felt increasingly out of his element.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The undeniable authority she wielded as a leader rendered him nearly powerless, dwarfed by her formidable presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time and again, Alexander found himself deferring to Daniela, uncertain how to steer their conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop dragging me into your nonsense-l&#39;ve got better things to do,&#34; Daniela said, her eyes meeting his as she clutched her pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander managed a terse, &#34;Just be careful.&#34; Daniela offered no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the spacious office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander knew he should make his exit, yet something made him linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, seemed utterly disinterested in continuing their interaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll be on my way then,&#34; he remarked, locking eyes with Daniela. &#34;I couldn&#39;t help but notice your office only has one plant-kind of drab, don&#39;t you think? I&#39;ve ordered some sweet osmanthus flowers to brighten it up. They&#39;ll be here soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t get a chance to object as Alexander hurried out, perhaps fearful of a rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the flowers arrived, the secretary let out a soft gasp, unable to hide her surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you want me to put these?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep them downstairs,&#34; Daniela responded with a hint of annoyance. &#34;I&#39;m allergic to them.&#34; The secretary wasted no time and had the flowers sent straight to the first-floor restroom, where Daniela would never see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheer weight of the massive flower pot had the employees gasping for breath by the time they got it downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Alexander out of his mind? If he was going to send flowers, shouldn&#39;t he have checked her preferences first? Daniela is allergic, and he is clueless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t Daniela just turn him down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gathered employees turned to the secretary,their curiosity unanimous. &#34;Does she still have feelings for him?&#34;</p>
