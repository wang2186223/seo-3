                <p>Confusion swept through the employees of Phillips Group like a sudden storm when they received notice of an unexpected three-day off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The calendar showed no holidaysor notable events-it was an ordinary week turned extraordinary without explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Cedric was generously handing out five-thousand-dollar vouchers for a luxury hotel buffet to every staff member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary asked, &#34;Lillian, could it be that Mr. Phillips is on the brink of closing down the company?Are these vouchers just a lavish parting gift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian raised her eyebrows. &#34;Why on earth would you jump to that conclusion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s shoulders slumped, his face etched with the resignation of a man already envisioning unemployment. &#34;What other explanation fits? Since our boss got romantically involved with your boss, his passion for the business has halved. It feels like he&#39;s gearing up to abandon ship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped Lillian. Indeed, the secretary wasn&#39;t entirely off base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lost track of how many times she had overheard Cedric planning out loud about retiring to a picturesque spot to concentrate on their family life with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was always in agreement, supportive as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, merging their personal fortunes had made them extraordinarily wealthy, capable of affording extravagant whims like owning a small nation. Financial concerns were a thing of the past for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But seriously, what&#39;s really going on with this break? And these vouchers? Come on, Lillian, you&#39;ve got to shed some light on this, or none of us will be able to enjoy that extravagant buffet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian offered a sly grin, leaving him in suspense. The secretary remained poised, his curiosity burning fiercely within him, as if he were literally digging his fingers into his scalp in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs, he drifted past the break room, where a whimsical tune floated through theair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, he peeked inside and came to astunned halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be Cedric? The formidable CEO whose mere whispers could upheave the market?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he actually singing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not merely humming along, but belting out a kids&#39; tune?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s features twisted in astonishment. He nearly retreated when Cedric whirled around. With a glass of vibrant orange juice in hand, Cedric&#39;s eyes locked onto his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary snapped to rigid attention and exclaimed with vigor, &#34;Hey, Mr. Phillips!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wave of his hand and an easy smile, Cedric replied, &#34;Hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his juice, Cedric sauntered away, leaving the secretary petrified and drenched in sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After enduring countless years in the trenches with Cedric, this was the first glimpse he had caught of Cedric shedding his armor, showing a carefree side reserved only for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that gentle greeting-was this really the same Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was absolutely certain he was losing his grip on reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was downright unsettling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some time, it appeared as though the entire world was in agreement that Cedric had become the kindest soul around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to spread the word, Cedric was itching to make an announcement, but Daniela firmly placed her hand on his arm, signaling to keep the news private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the harm in it? The reason was clear: ruthless adversaries were skulking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, only Ryan, Lillian, Cedric, and Daniela knew the secret. In the privacy of their home, Cedric would beam with joy, regularly exclaiming, &#34;I&#39;m about to become a father! Daniela and I are expecting a baby! Can you believe it? I&#39;m going to have a child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the beginning, Ryan and Lillian matched his enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To celebrate, they orchestrated a cozy, intimate gathering just for the four of themn in their basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the weeks slipped by, the novelty began to fade for Ryan and Lillian, though Cedric&#39;s enthusiasm never waned, as if the revelation were perpetually fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian couldn&#39;t fathom his persistent excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only a child, wasn&#39;t it? What was the reason for such a commotion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric would retort with fervent conviction, &#34;Indeed it is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cherished watching Cedric radiate such unstoppable joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s presence would have delighted her more if he hadn&#39;t been so persistent in lingering around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, have you made your choice yet? When will you leave him and be with me? I bring much more to the table than Cedric does at the moment. I&#39;m at the helm of the commerce association, commanding the support of thousands of companiesthat could benefit you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gazed at Daniela with unabashed adoration, utterly captivated by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he inched closer, intent on making his point, Hackett stormed in, flanked by his entourage,and headed straight for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping protectively in front of her, Alexander shielded Daniela with his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay behind me,&#34; he murmured to her. &#34;These men are from the association, and I&#39;ll handle them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could elaborate. Hackett seized Alexander, dragged him aside forcefully, and tossed him out of the way. &#34;Daniela! Your hands are stained with blood. You&#39;re responsible for Marcus&#39; death, aren&#39;t you?&#34; Hackett accused, his eyes burning with a fierce intensity as if he could strike her down on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeling from Hackett&#39;s furious accusation, Alexander stood to one side, shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela began to step forward, only for someone to grasp her hand and pull her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned sharply, her senses heightened by the familiar scent of cologne that filled the air.</p>
