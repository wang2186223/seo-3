                <p>Mason bumped into Daniela unexpectedly during his nighttime stroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just left a lavish gathering and appeared to be heavily intoxicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the dim shimmer of lamplight, he caught sight of her before her company building, standing as if awaiting someone&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s figure was impossible to ignore. Despite her slim limbs, her frame exuded symmetry and grace.Mason couldn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the weight of his gaze, she turned her head slowly, her expression cool and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief glance was enough to send a firestorm through his bloodstream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was breathtaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense why Cedric would throw away the McCoy legacy for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason ran his tongue over his lips, shrugged off Joseph&#39;s grip, and stumbled forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, boozy odor hit Daniela&#39;s nose, making her expression tighten. She squinted at his flushed face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re Daniela,&#34; Mason slurred. His features, passed down from a forgettable bloodline, lacked distinction. He was the sort of man you&#39;d pass by and forget in seconds. Right now, wearing a grin filled with vulgarity, he was revolting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re insanely gorgeous,&#34; he said, eyeing her from head to toe.′′Agem like you doesn&#39;t belong with someone like Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew her allure. But only a few ever dared to approach her with such shameless boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand, holding her phone, lowered slightly. She raised her head with a faint sneer. &#34;Then tell me-who do I belong with?&#34; Though her voice sounded calm, her grip on the phone tightened until the veins stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph noticed instantly. He rushed over, trying to stop Mason before he did something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could act, Mason leaned closer, grinning in a sickening way, licking his lips again. &#34;Obviously,me.Let me show you what real pleasure feels like.&#34; His hand rose, a finger stretching toward her jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of tendons tearing broke the silence, and Mason&#39;s delayed howl ripped through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had grabbed Mason by the sleeve and, with a deft twist, rendered one of his hands useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped to his knees, eyes leaking from the sheer agony, but she didn&#39;t let go. Her face was carved from ice.&#34;If nobody ever taught you how to treat women, I&#39;m happy to do the honors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason trembled so hard he couldn&#39;t even scream anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph froze in disbelief. Daniela had just taken down the newly crowned leader of McCoy Group. It was madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Mason looked up in a rage, only to be met with a violent slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cracking sound came from inside his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spat out a thick glob of saliva. Then, two front teeth clattered to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph almost collapsed on the spot. The arrogance he had displayed had vanished, replaced by sheer terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms.Harper, please! He didn&#39;t mean it-he&#39;s drunk, he wasn&#39;t thinking. Can&#39;t we just forget this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow. &#34;Forget this? Are you joking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph nodded repeatedly, sweating. &#34;Yes, just... please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Mason&#39;s hands was disabled and he had lost two teeth. It was enough,wasn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s fear of Daniela ballooned into full-blown dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But honestly, that kind of thing should never even happen to begin with,&#34; Daniela said, voice soft as velvet but deadly sharp Her calm words cut deeper than screams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mason, panting and drenched in sweat, clutched his side and shouted at Joseph, &#34;Why are you standing there? Go bring security&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela still had him pinned, her hold precise. Even the slightest twitch triggered fresh waves of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph paused briefly, then turned on his heel and sprinted into the McCoy Group building. A few minutes later,he reappeared,flanked by two dozen security guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you waiting for? Get her!&#34; Mason bellowed, rage twisting his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uniformed guards-broad-shouldered and imposing-charged as a single force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had only stepped away to retrieve Daniela&#39;s coat. But when he came back down, he saw two dozen men writhed on the pavement, wounded and groaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood still,stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph,overwhelmed by disbelief, stared wide-eyed. Never in his wildest thoughts had he imagined Daniela capable of such raw, overwhelming strength. Even while restraining Mason, she&#39;d dismantled a squad of trained personnel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered and helpless, Joseph was grasping for a lifeline. The moment he spotted Cedric, his expression shifted to one of desperate hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric! You&#39;ve got to stop her-she&#39;s completely unhinged. She&#39;s killing someone!&#34;</p>
