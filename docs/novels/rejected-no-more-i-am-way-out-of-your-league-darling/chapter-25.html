                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t get rid of the nagging worry about Daniela falling for Alexander again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela fell for someone, it was like an illness -impossible to stop and completely irrational.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear still lingered in Lillian&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d rather give up Elite Lux than watch Daniela go through another painful ordeal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, sensing Lillian&#39;s worry, turned to her loyal friend, the one who&#39;d stood by her through everything.With a gentle smile, she reassured, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I don&#39;t make the same mistake twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when she was head over heels for Alexander,hanging on to every word he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that love was gone. Alexander didn&#39;t mean a thing to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was seething with embarrassment. Not only had she fallen, but Daniela had made sure to step on her foot for good measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her swollen, bruised foot throbbed with pain as Alexander helped her home. By the time they reached the door, she was already crying out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, hurry, I&#39;m going to die from all this bullying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was excitedly telling her friends all about Joyce&#39;s upcoming engagement to Alexander when she suddenly heard Joyce&#39;s cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she rushed out. The moment she saw Joyce&#39;s swollen foot, her reaction was dramatic,as if everything was falling apart. &#34;Caiden! Caiden!Come down here! Our baby girl is hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hurried down the stairs so fast that one of his slippers fell off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he caught sight of Joyce&#39;s injured foot, his expression contorted with a mix of anger and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; he snapped, his voice tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce quickly began to explain, &#34;It was Daniela! I went to the auction with Alexander today, and as soon as she saw me, she got furious. I went to the restroom,and she followed me in. She shoved me and then stepped right on my foot. Dad, it hurts so much!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden frowned sharply. &#34;Really? Daniela&#39;s completely losing it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce added fuel to the fire. &#34;Dad, I just went to the auction to apologize. I know l&#39;ve been careless and hurt her, so I wanted to make it right. But she called me greedy. She accused me of wanting the three floors of the Luxor Tower. Dad, I didn&#39;t mean anything by it-I just wanted us to get along as sisters. But she got so angry and attacked me. Do you think she&#39;s mad because I asked her for something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face darkened with rage. &#34;She&#39;s gone way too far! What does she mean by &#39;her things&#39; or &#39;your things&#39;? It&#39;s all part of the family. If you want three floors, they should be yours! If you want five or ten,you should get them too! You&#39;re her sister, her family.How can she be so selfish and ungrateful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there with his hands on his hips, his frustration growing. It was then that he noticed Alexander standing quietly to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, did you hear that? Daniela&#39;s totally out of line! You need to do something about her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stayed calm, his tone distant. &#34;We&#39;re divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if you&#39;re divorced? Everyone knows Daniela always took your word seriously. You were her husband, and even though you&#39;re no longer together,you still have a responsibility to guide her. Just look at what she&#39;s done-posting things online that brought shame to the family, and now at the auction,getting involved with the organizer. What kind of message does that send?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce kept her head lowered, but a smug smile tugged at her lips. Caiden&#39;s unshakable support was exactly what she had hoped for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Alexander, expecting him to back her up and stand against Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander&#39;s words crushed her hopes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela is the boss behind the auction, not the organizer,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden and Katrina froze, staring at him, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed on, &#34;As we were leaving, the organizer told someone that Daniela, CEO of Elite Lux,owns the auction house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words landed like a bomb. Turning to the shocked Caiden and Katrina, Alexander added, &#34;I&#39;ve brought Joyce home safely. I&#39;ll be leaving now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stood frozen, taking a few seconds to process Alexander&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Alexander headed towards his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina snapped out of her daze and hurried after him.&#34;Alexander! Ask your grandfather when he&#39;s available so our families can talk about your engagement to Joyce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander got in his car, started the engine, and drove off into the night without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside, Caiden grabbed his phone and called a friend to check if Daniela&#39;s influence had really expanded this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were the case, then he&#39;d have something to proudly boast about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina stood by the window, her eyes following Alexander&#39;s car as it faded from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce,still resting against her mother, glanced up at her with a puzzled look and tilted her head. &#34;Mom,what&#39;s got your attention?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce,how did Daniela behave towards Alexander at the auction today?&#34; Katrina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a dismissive snort. &#34;She&#39;s playing hard to get now. Instead of chasing him like she used to, she&#39;s acting like she doesn&#39;t care at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s chest tightened at her words. &#34;And how did Alexander react to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce lifted her chin, a proud smile tugging at her lips.&#34;Well, of course, he still looks down on her, just like before! Alexander only has eyes for me. Mom, just wait-once I marry into the Bennett family, Daniela will be so jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina helped Joyce inside. After walking for a bit,she turned her head, glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek black car had already blended into the traffic, its taillights disappearing into the darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina murmured, &#34;Nothing and no one will stop my daughter from finding her happiness. Not a soul.&#34;</p>
