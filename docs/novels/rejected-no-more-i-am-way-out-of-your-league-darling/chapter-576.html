                <p>Predictably, Elyse straightened her back, her voice laced with a hopeful tone. &#34;Daniela, do you recall the promise you made to look after me when I grow old?And what about the villa your mother purchased?You mentioned that if Natalie were to marry, you&#39;d gift it to us as a wedding present, didn&#39;t you? I&#39;ve always told my daughters how big-hearted you are-that a villa is but a trifle for you. Now, given my current predicament of having no place to call home -not to mention Nina&#39;s status as a celebrity making it quite awkward for her to stay here-how about you transfer the villa to us? Nina and I could move there.It would be more convenient for everyone, wouldn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat felt dry after her monologue. She had rehearsed this plea in her mind for a long time now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Natalie behind bars, she needed to secure something tangible from Daniela. Without it, her later  years loomed empty and bleak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse noticed Daniela&#39;s silence and let out a nervous chuckle, attempting to lighten the mood. &#34;Of course,Nina is content to stay here,but Daniela, think about the future. With your own children on the horizon and Nina always around, things could get complicated.You understand, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to bear the tension, Lillian and Josie quietly excused themselves, slipping out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela remained composed, her expression unreadable as she absorbed Elyse&#39;s words, her demeanor the epitome of patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Daniela, have your say,&#34; Elyse urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Daniela chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse leaned in, her eyes wide with anticipation,hanging on every word that would escape Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Elyse, your concept was rather impressive, but it&#39;s truly unfortunate.&#34; Elyse&#39;s features tightened momentarily in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then why is it unfortunate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just before you stepped through the door, I signed a contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzlement washed over Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That very villa you&#39;re so fond of has just been acquired for a new theme park venture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, a shadow of disappointment crossed Elyse&#39;s face, but quickly her eyes lit up. &#34;Acquired? Truly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with an affirming tilt of her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about the compensation? Was it substantial?&#34; Elyse tapped her foot against the ground, consumed by regret. If only she had known about the theme park planned for that area, she never would have parted with her villa at such a bargain price. She could have raked in a small fortune in compensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by remorse, Elyse felt tears prickling her eyes. &#34;Daniela, since that villa was originally mine, don&#39;t you think I deserve some of the compensation? Not all,just half-fifty percent,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa had fetched a handsome sum,and now,with the upcoming acquisition, its value was bound to have skyrocketed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes gleamed with fervor; she was utterly oblivious to Natalie&#39;s predicament behind bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; Daniela countered, skepticism lacing her tone. &#34;By that logic, should the new owner share the theme park&#39;s profits with you too? You did get paid when you sold the place, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse brushed off the logic with a wave of her hand.&#34;But aren&#39;t we family? Shouldn&#39;t we be sharing whatever comes our way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a wry smile in response, her patience thinning. &#34;And if I hadn&#39;t sold the villa and its value had plummeted, would you be offering to absorb the losses with me?&#34; Elyse&#39;s laugh was unapologetic, rich with mirth. &#34;Oh,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, you&#39;ve always had a knack for turning a profit. A small loss here or there means nothing to you-I&#39;m your aunt, after all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter followed, lighter, mingling with the lingering tension. She found herself unable to stomach her aunt&#39;s greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just hand over fifty percent of the money, Daniela.It&#39;s a trifle for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse had steeled herself for a drawn-out dispute,but Daniela&#39;s unexpected acquiescence took her aback. &#34;Very well, I&#39;ll instruct the finance team to process the transfer to your account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of elation crashed over Elyse, propelling her almost into Daniela&#39;s arms in an impulsive display of gratitude. However, Daniela forestalled the embrace with a preemptive gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overflowing with gratitude, Elyse exclaimed, &#34;T&#39;ll send over the details of my bank account. Oh,Daniela, I know you&#39;re a good girl!&#34; Nina, fresh off the set, arrived home to find Elyse radiating sheer delight by the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only hours before, Elyse had been a picture of contrition on the set; now, she carried herself with an air of triumph, seemingly towering over everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ostentatiously ignored Nina, sweeping past with a dramatic flare of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, hardly taken aback, sauntered into the villa.Catching sight of Daniela, she queried, &#34;So, you&#39;ve given Elyse the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wry smile, Daniela responded, &#34;Was it that transparent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina confirmed with anod, &#34;Blatantly. She was virtually soaring, head in the clouds, blind to the world around her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a chuckle. &#34;Indeed, I&#39;ve compensated her for that villa where you once resided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina erupted into giggles. &#34;No wonder she&#39;s over the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True enough, Elyse was ecstatic. With such a windfall, she envisioned a future free from dependency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ventured to the mall, indulged in a shopping spree, draining her pockets, and upon returning home,she dialed the finance department at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was imperious over the phone.&#34;Ensley,why does transferring such a hefty sum take an eternity?How much longer must I wait? I intended to purchase a handbag today, and this delay is quite inconvenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Ensley Ruiz was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single dollar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a handbag?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t grasp why Elyse was so desperate for this particular compensation. Was she really in such dire need of that one dollar? Elyse&#39;s demand sounded as though she was entitled to a fortune, not just a measly buck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was utterly absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood that the land once belonged to Elyse, but now it was under Daniela&#39;s name. Phillips Group planned to erect a theme park there. Being partners, Daniela had suggested they merely make a nominal transaction of one dollar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was this land still of any concern to Elyse? Why did they need to note that the compensation was a gift to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole situation baffled her.</p>
