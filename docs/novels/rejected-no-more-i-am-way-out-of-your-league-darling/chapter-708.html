                <p>Word of the partnership between McCoy Group and Alexander spread to Oiscoll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost asked Hamilton, &#34;Mr. McCoy, it appears your sons plan to use Alexander as a pawn against Cedric.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton took a slow sip of his coffee, his voice calm. &#34;I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was responsible for overseeing every contract within McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Considering the current strength of Phillips Group, battling McCoy Group is no easy feat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was a local mogul, while Hamilton wasthe world&#39;s richest man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost was being subtle in saying this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton chuckled. &#34;I know. What truly concerns me isn&#39;t Phillips Group, but Daniela. I need to understand Cedric&#39;s place in her heart. Only then can I determine who is worthy of the McCoy family&#39;s fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost asked, &#34;Isn&#39;t that a bit too harsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton scoffed, &#34;In the upper echelons of society, it&#39;s always the victor who claims everything. If I&#39;m not cruel to Cedric, someone else will be-better that it&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost fell into a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant McCoy Group solidified their deep collaboration with Bennett Group, news about Bennett Group flooded Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a single day, Bennett Group catapulted from tenth place nationwide to claim the top company in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People all across Olisvine-and indeed the entire nation-were showering Alexander with praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, seeing the flood of online comments about the Bennett family, couldn&#39;t suppress a feeling of joy. &#34;Dad! Didn&#39;t I tell you? Why did you go ahead with the collaboration without consulting me? What if Daniela thinks I&#39;m siding with them against her and Cedric?&#34; Alexander&#39;s voice was tinged with displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard smiled warmly and passed his phone to Alexander. &#34;Look, they&#39;re all saying I raised you right.They&#39;re even saying you&#39;ve become more handsome. This one praises you as young and full of potential.This one highlights your sharp strategic mind, pointing out that even the powerful McCoy Group is eager to partner with you, and that your future shines with endless possibilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s frustration bubbled over. &#34;Dad! Are you even hearing me? You&#39;ve already stepped away from managing the company. You can&#39;t just bypass me to sign deals with McCoy Group and steal the company&#39;s seal.That&#39;s illegal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it?&#34; Richard replied smugly, clearly relishing the praise online. &#34;If it&#39;s illegal, then sue me! Send me to jail!Alexander, I&#39;m doing this for your benefit. I made the decision you couldn&#39;t. What more do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard genuinely couldn&#39;t comprehend his son&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this moment, he was fully consumed by the online adulation. &#34;You&#39;re my son. You need to understand that I&#39;ve worked tirelessly to raise you, hoping you&#39;d lead Bennett Group to the pinnacle of success. You can&#39;t just fixate on your love life and ignore the expectations I have for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Alexander retorted, &#34;Dad, I&#39;ve already told you l&#39;ll put in the effort! Why couldn&#39;t you just wait for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait for what?&#34; Richard snapped. &#34;There&#39;s a shortcut right in front of us. Why wait? How many times must l say it? Daniela doesn&#39;t love you. She will never love you. Can&#39;t you see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gazed at Alexander with frustration. &#34;Fine. You won&#39;t give up, will you? I&#39;ll give you one last chance.Go to Daniela now, tell her you&#39;re willing to drop the collaboration with McCoy Group if she agrees to be with you again...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard quickly corrected himself. &#34;Daniela doesn&#39;t even need to promise to be with you again. As long as she&#39;s willing to offer you another chance, I won&#39;t push the collaboration. Is that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope sparked in Alexander&#39;s eyes. &#34;Really?&#34; Richard nodded firmly. &#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander couldn&#39;t promise that they would end up together, but if it was just a chance...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, Dad, just wait. I&#39;ll make sure you retract the collaboration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, with her memories lost, wouldn&#39;t be so heartless as to deny him even a single chance.</p>
