                <p>Nikolas read the message and let out a bitter laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he dialed the number and unleashed his fury. &#34;You&#39;re pathetic! Just admit you&#39;re useless instead of feeding me excuses! It&#39;s been three years,and Clarinda is still missing. You&#39;re telling me you won&#39;t take the job? Cedric is a soft-hearted businessman who wouldn&#39;t even hurt a fly, and Daniela looks so delicate that a breeze could knock her over.And you&#39;re telling me she leads mercenaries? Don&#39;t make me laugh! If you can&#39;t do the job, I&#39;ll find someone who can. Don&#39;t waste my time with lies. I&#39;ve got the money, and if I want Cedric dead, I&#39;ll make it happen.Mark my words, if you pass up this job, you&#39;ll never see another penny from the McCoy family again!Loser!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas then ended the call and immediately called his younger brother, Kohen McCoy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kohen, those mercenaries are too scared to take the job. Get Dad&#39;s bodyguards for me and do it discreetly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hesitated, glancing across the table at Hamilton,who sat watching him with a cold expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, what are you talking about? My signal...&#34; Before he could finish, the phone was yanked from his grip and put on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Nikolas asked, oblivious to what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.Listen, Nikolas, maybe you should focus on something else right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I had something else to do, I wouldn&#39;t be calling you!&#34; Nikolas seethed, still raw from Daniela&#39;s threat.&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you? Get Dad&#39;s bodyguards over here now.Cedric&#39;s gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen forced out an awkward chuckle,trying to cover up. &#34;Come on, Nikolas. Cedric is just a small-time businessman in Olisvine. Why waste the effort on him?Is this really necessary? If you ask me, you should just come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kohen reached to hang up, Hamilton&#39;s cane blocked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas frowned. &#34;Kohen, what the hell are you saying?don&#39;t understand. Cedric is Dad&#39;s illegitimate son.You have no idea. Cedric&#39;s gotten close to Daniela,the former wealthiest person in the world. The men l sent after him previously have vanished without a trace.I need people who won&#39;t fail this time at killing these two. Dad&#39;s bodyguards are top-tier professionals and highly trained. Once they take Cedric out, I&#39;ll be on the first flight back. Get them on a chopper to Olisvine immediately! I&#39;m waiting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s personal bodyguards were, in fact, elite assassins trained by the McCoy family since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their expertise in combat, firearms, and close-quarters combat was unparalleled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen hung up and cast a nervous glance at Hamilton,who sat on the opposite sofa, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s gaze was unreadable as he spoke slowly.&#34;Cedric? My illegitimate son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen barely dared to breathe. &#34;We only found out recently by accident. We were just about to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lifted his gaze. &#34;The eight hundred million spent recently by Nikolas was to hire those mercenaries to kill him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those mercenaries had disappeared overnight, and Hamilton had sent people to investigate. So, this was the reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I call Nikolas back?&#34; Kohen asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shook his head. &#34;No need.&#34; He turned to a man beside him. &#34;Ghost, you investigate Cedric for me.&#34; He wanted to see if his illegitimate son could be capable of achieving great things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen was taken aback. &#34;Dad, you&#39;re sending Ghost?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ghost was the leader of Hamilton&#39;s assassins. No one in the McCoy family had ever seen him fight because it was rumored that anyone who had faced him was already dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton rose to his feet, heading for the stairs.Before disappearing up them, he turned back to Kohen. &#34;Don&#39;t tell Nikolas I already know about Cedric.Or I&#39;ll send you somewhere so remote you&#39;ll regret ever speaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen shuddered, quickly calling Nikolas again.&#34;Nikolas, Dad&#39;s out of the country for a meeting abroad. Ghost is at home, though. Do you want me to send him to back you up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes gleamed with excitement. &#34;Kohen, thank you! You know, Daniela&#39;s been getting way too cocky.Get Ghost here, immediately. I want her put in her &#39;place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hung up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen stared at the ended call for a long time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this about Cedric? Why was Daniela suddenly involved? He shook his head, perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was certain that sending Ghost meant Cedric was as good as dead.</p>
