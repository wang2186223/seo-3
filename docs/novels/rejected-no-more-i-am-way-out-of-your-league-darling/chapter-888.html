                <p>Nikolas watched the mist creep in through the air vent. He said quickly into the phone, &#34;Are you free right now? Can you come to Saint Sea Resort and get me out of here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone sharpened in an instant. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas swayed a little. &#34;I&#39;m not feeling great,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after that, the phone slipped from his fingers and hit the floor with a soft thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice came through faintly from the speaker. &#34;Saint Sea Resort. I&#39;ll be there in five. If you start feeling worse, head to the restroom and splash cold water on your face. Try to stay awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas managed a weak &#34;okay&#34; before the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know why he felt the way he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, hearing Daniela&#39;s voice settled something inside him. Nikolas gave a small, bitter smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never imagined he&#39;d fall into his father&#39;s trap this easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice called out from outside the door.&#34;Mr. McCoy, Damon and Nikolas aren&#39;t cooperating, but the others are waiting in their rooms. You can bring the princess in now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas assumed it was Hamilton. He forced himself to lift his head, pale and shaky, just in time to see the door swing open with a violent kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stormed in. Carol came in right behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at them, frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol crouched beside him, supporting his arm. &#34;Are you okay?&#34; she asked gently. Nikolas wanted to shake his head. Before he could answer, the secretary&#39;s shrill voice rang from the hallway.&#34;Who gave you permission to come in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw Daniela shove someone aside-probably the secretary-but his vision was already dimming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything went dark after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Hamilton came with the princess, Nikolas had already been taken away. Hamilton clenched his jaw but kept his expression preasant. &#34;This way, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t move. &#34;Why did you even ask me to come? I told you last time I only wanted to meet Cedric.Why is it always you who greets me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a dry laugh and opened the nearest door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Russell was seated quietly. The princess looked around, then flicked the switch on the wall. Light poured into the room. She narrowed her eyes. &#34;Is there someone else in here? If Cedric isn&#39;t, I&#39;m leaving.Don&#39;t waste my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had no choice but to lead the princess to the third room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess peeked in, spotted someone who wasn&#39;t Cedric, and her expression turned cold.&#34;What exactly are you trying to pull?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped walking altogether. Damon remained seated in the room while Duran was escorted out. The princess turned to Hamilton, eyes narrowing. &#34;I want an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a nervous laugh. &#34;I&#39;m only asking if it has to be Cedric. Couldn&#39;t you consider one of my other sons? Duran&#39;s an excellent choice, if I may say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess frowned. &#34;Are you serious right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill in her voice made it clear she wasn&#39;t amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton kept his smile, though it wavered. &#34;I&#39;m just trying to give you more to think about. Marriage is a big decision. It shouldn&#39;t be rushed. You might regret...&#34; He launched into a long, winding speech.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;l&#39;ve already met your sons. I&#39;ve already told you I&#39;m not interested. I&#39;m giving you three days. If I don&#39;t meet Ceddric by then, I&#39;ll talk to my father. He&#39;ll take it from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for his response, she turned and got in her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood frozen, fists clenched by his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn.Is Daniela really trying to get in my way? Nikolas is not that different from Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by frustration, Hamilton stormed into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You always say Cedric belongs to you and that you&#39;re married. Fine. I&#39;ll give you that!&#34; Hamilton&#39;s glare was sharp. &#34;But Nikolas doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s my son. Who gave you the right to take him from me? I want answers,Daniela. And I want them now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up, calm and steady.11|Nikolas truly still part of your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton opened his mouth to respond, but she was already holding up her phone. &#34;Nikolas called me.He asked for help. And if I recall, you disowned him publicly not long ago. So what kind of claim do you really have over him now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;Fine. I won&#39;t argue about Nikolas. Let&#39;s talk about Cedric. What will it take for you to leave him? Name your price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Daniela replied, &#34;There&#39;s no price. I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s glare darkened. &#34;So now you&#39;re against me? You really want to start a fight? If you keep pushing,don&#39;t expect a happy ending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even look his way.&#34;Is that so? Then I guess we&#39;ll both find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression turned to ice. &#34;Ungrateful, aren&#39;t you? I held back before. Let you grow your business right under my nose. But I&#39;ve had enough. Now I&#39;ll show you what real power looks like. I&#39;ll remind you who controls Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
