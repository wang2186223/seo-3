                <p>Ethan, reputed for his blunt honesty, remarked, &#34;Relax, Brad. I&#39;ll write a confession for you. I&#39;ve just finished one and know how to write it. Just attach your signature and fingerprint; then it&#39;s officially valid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he spoke, he grabbed a sheet of paper and began writing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway, he noted, &#34;People should own up for what they&#39;ve done. Daniela, please rest assured-I&#39;Il write everything down. Whatever actions you decide to take against us, we&#39;re prepared for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad absorbed it all, his face increasingly shadowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he managed a forced chuckle, muttering, &#34;Yes. Daniela, we weren&#39;t in the right state when we harmed your mother. Regret&#39;s been eating at us for years. Now that we&#39;re family, could you possibly spare us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad observed Daniela, gauging her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, eyes still on the paper, said flatly, &#34;Brad, that&#39;s not how it works. Everyone should face the consequences after making mistakes, or others might follow suit. Daniela has a generous spirit, but it&#39;s no excuse to exploit it. Letting the legal system handle this sounds most impartial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his shares secured in Daniela&#39;s company, Ethan felt anchored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added with gravity, &#34;And besides, callng someone &#39;family&#39; shouldn&#39;t justify burdening them unfairly.Once, we leaned on Hamilton for the same excuse-and that was unjust. We should live in peace but not at the expense of fairness. Isn&#39;t that right, HHamilton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan shot Hamilton a warm glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave a grunt in reply, but his eyes never strayed from Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad squeezed out a pained smile. &#34;Exactly... That&#39;s what I meant. I was going to say the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he nearly bit down in frustration. Ethan gave a short laugh, sliding the completed confession over. &#34;Here it is. Review it if you must.Otherwise, just sign, put your fingerprint on it, and give it to Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad lowered his gaze. A wave of disorientation swept over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan had indeed been exhaustive. Every detail, every phrase, every link to the tragedy that befell Daniela&#39;s mother-it was all inscribed like a full-length report, thousands of words in minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wordlessly, Brad stared at Ethan, who returned a cheerful grin and asked, &#34;Want to add anything, Brad?&#34; He held out the writing tool and the red ink pad. &#34;Just place your signature and print here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad hovered over the document, then glanced up at the circle around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained expressionless, his stare icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had her arms tucked, amusement glinting in her stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s jaw was tight, eyes fixed on Brad&#39;s every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad felt cornered. He clutched the pen but couldn&#39;t bring it down. &#34;Well... Ethan, your penmanship stil hasn&#39;t improved. See? A few spelling flaws here and there.&#34; He turned to Daniela. &#34;Daniela, this won&#39;t do.Let me recover a bit-once my elbow feels better, I&#39;ll draft you something heartfelt myself. A sincere apology should look the part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan nearly retorted about the supposed errors, but Daniela had already turned to the television, answering in a distant tone, &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll wait for that document then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad took in the detached look on her face and had a strange feeling that he had missed his last chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Ethan continued to stay in Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper asked, &#34;Mr. McCoy, are you looking to fix something in the kitchen? Tell me what you&#39;d like -I&#39;ll prepare it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad peered around the vacant sitting area and cleared his throat. &#34;Lunch wasn&#39;t filling. Just a smnall bowl of noodles, something quick-l wouldn&#39;t want to rouse anyone,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad wandered toward the refrigerator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he opened the door, the housekeeper quickly added, &#34;Those fruits are reserved for Ms. Harper. Mr.Phillips brought them exclusively for her. They&#39;re from his private garden-no one else should touch them.If you&#39;d like fruit, I&#39;ll take some from the secondary fridge and clean it for you shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s pregnancy made her crave pomegranates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric peeled them for her daily, placing the ruby seeds into a dainty dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before shutting the fridge, Brad fixated on the vibrant pomegranates resting in the crisper drawer.</p>
