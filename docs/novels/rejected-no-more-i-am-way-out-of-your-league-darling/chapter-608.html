                <p>The days began to settle into a serene rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela&#39;s pregnancy advanced, her belly became noticeably larger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first trimester brought with it severe morning sickness, and she lost a notable amount of weight,which deeply troubled Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to ease her discomfort, Cedric became creative in the kitchen, whipping up nourishing meals for Daniela. He also took on more responsibilities at Elite Lux to reduce her workload.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the fifth month of her pregnancy, Cedric had purchased an island that offered a consistent climate,surrounded by mountains and waters, ideal for a peaceful getaway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela concluded her duties at the company, gearing up for a vacation with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love, I need to sign a contract at the office this afternoon.It shouldn&#39;t take longer than an hour. Wait for me at home, and we&#39;ll head to the airport right after,&#34; Cedric told her. Having already packed for both of them, Daniela settled comfortably on the couch to watch TV. &#34;Take care driving,&#34; she reminded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric walked away with a satisfied smile, warmth lingering in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Daniela became pregnant, his days had been filled with joy and anticipation, eagerly counting down to the moment their child would arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric left, Ryan was alerted by the company about a glitch in the security system, prompting him to leave their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Lillian and Josie were at the vet,sorting out an issue with unavailable prescribed dog food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, Daniela was left alone in the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she bent down to find it, a cold breeze swept through, and the door creaked open as if pushed by the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising cautiously, Daniela spotted a shadowy figure Covered in black, donning a black hat, at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She narrowed her eyes at the intruder.&#34;It&#39;s you?&#34; Daniela attempted to evade the blow, but her pregnant state hindered her agility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pain shot through her shoulder, followed by the overpowering smell of a noxious substance,causing her to faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When consciousness returned, she found herself confined in the storage room outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wrists were bound to the bedpost, and the room reeked of gasoline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she gathered the breath to scream, the figure in black flicked a lighter, igniting the room in flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, the room was consumed by fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the fire raged around her, Daniela&#39;s coughs filled the air, desperate and harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure watched from outside, his voice cold and threatening. &#34;Daniela, this is your doing. You were to0much of a threat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From afar, Cedric noticed someone lurking outside the storage room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed on the accelerator, jumped from his car,  saw a figure scaling the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to chase him but was halted by Daniela&#39;s faint cries. With a heavy heart, he dashed towards the blazing flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the sound of an explosive boom shattered the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela Harper,CEO of Elite Lux, died in a horrific fire.Cedric Phillips of Phillips Group is critically injured and remains unconscious,&#34; said the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In the wake of Daniela Harper&#39;s death, Elite Lux has halted all domestic operations, with Cedric Phillips still in a coma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weeks turned into months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Devastated by his wife&#39;s death, Cedric Phillips resigns as CEO of Phillips Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood in front of the towering Elite Lux building,his heart heavy with loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hoped his efforts would mend things between them,allowing for a new beginning with Daniela. He could never have foreseen such a catastrophic conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night after night, Alexander sought refuge in bars,nursing his grief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled upon a fresh advertisement from Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the image struck him-a silhouette that seemed eerily familiar.</p>
