                <p>Daniela had been slapped by her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire staff at Elite Lux was very angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, quietly went to her office, sat in her chair, and stared at a video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video showed Joyce at a bar, standing on a table with a glass in her hand. Her carefree and bold attitude was on full display as she loudly announced to the crowd, &#34;Dad always says that meeting me and my mom was the best thing in his life. We brought a joy to his world that he never knew before. He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he&#39;s reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed. So what if Daniela puts on a tough front? She&#39;s nothing compared to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hand shook ever so slightly as she clutched</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, this was the truth.Growing up, she always had this nagging feeling that her father didn&#39;t love her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her mother was alive, he made an effort to pretend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her mother died, he completely distanced himself, and Daniela naively believed it was because he was drowning in grief over her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, before her mother&#39;s funeral had even ended, he had already remarried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was left stunned and utterly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to rationalize it in every way she could.Maybe he needed someone to help him cope, or perhaps he was so lost in missing her mother that he couldn&#39;t express it. After all, love didn&#39;t always have to be spoken; maybe he carried it silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew her father was still young, and it wasn&#39;t entirely fair to expect him to live alone for the rest of his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But everything changed on one blistering afternoon when the central air conditioning broke down,jolting her awake from the suffocating heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting to find out if there was a power outage, she stepped out of her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as she entered the living room, she froze in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, in the middle of the room, was Katrina.She was wearing her mother&#39;s clothes, sitting on Caiden&#39;s lap. The sound of their labored breathing filled the room, like an unbearable echo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She overheard Caiden telling Katrina, &#34;Katrina,I love you and only you. That awful woman is finally gone.She used her money to control me, but what man would tolerate being treated like a servant? All she ever did was earn money-she was useless for anything else. A woman who can&#39;t even make a man happy...What kind of woman is that? Katrina, it&#39;s only after meeting you that I&#39;ve learned what it feels like to be a real man. You are the wife I&#39;ve chosen to spend my life with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a scorching summer day, and as Daniela stood at the top of the stairs, everything in her life seemed to fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She saw them in the living room, locked in a sweaty embrace, their faces flushed and dazed. Without a second thought, she ran to her room, leaned over the toilet, and retched uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone else, Caidenappeared to be the ideal husband and a loving father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could have imagined that behind his respectable front hid a heart so twisted and depraved it was impossible to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her thoughts, Daniela didn&#39;t notice when the office door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s harsh words-&#34;He even says that every time he sees Daniela, he&#39;s reminded of his her mother and feels utterly repulsed&#34;-played on an endless loop in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to every word like a punishment, as though engraving Caiden&#39;s cruelty into her memory,hurting herself over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a hand took the phone from her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, snapping out of her daze, looking up in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could process what was happening,someone knelt down in front of her, wrapping her in a comforting embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s steady, low voice filled the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! You&#39;re not alone. Don&#39;t be scared. I&#39;ll always be by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Daniela let her guard down,surrendering her strength as she leaned into his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t one to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since that summer, she hadn&#39;t shed a tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hitting her wasn&#39;t new; she never cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, as Cedric held her close, his voice trembling more than hers, whispering that she didn&#39;t need to be afraid, her eyes began to fill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like walking alone for ages down a dark,desolate path. She could pretend it didn&#39;t hurt,and saying it aloud seemed unnecessary. Yet, the moment someone stood up for her, the floodgates opened, and the emotions she&#39;d buried for so long spilled out uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart broke into pieces. The woman he had cherished for so many years cried quietly against his shoulder.His chest tightened with so much pain that it felt like he couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night gradually settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared into the darkened sky and murmured,&#34;Cedric, from this moment on, I no longer have a father.&#34;</p>
