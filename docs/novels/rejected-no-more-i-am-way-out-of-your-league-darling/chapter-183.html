                <p>Katrina observed Alexander, her smile widening as she lounged comfortably, nibbling on a snack, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, it was inconsequential whether Alexander wound up with Joyce or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her true intent was simply to agitate everyone involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had relished her triumphs for far too long, and Katrina was eager to watch her wrestle with her emotions, torn and indecisive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric or Alexander? The choice was anything but simple-one embodied a love from her past, while the other was her unwavering confidant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of Daniela&#39;s choice, one would inevitably feel the sting of rejection, and even the chosen one might begin to harbor doubts and mistrust over time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever there were fissures, there lay opportunities for manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina relished the thought of shattering Daniela&#39;s seemingly flawless existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my,&#34; Katrina exclaimed, her tone oozing with feigned concern as she ushered Alexander into the room.&#34;Alexander, it seems you&#39;ve had a bit too much to drink. What could have possibly brought you here so late,and in that condition? It must be serious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to Daniela with a layer of mock sincerity thick in her voice. &#34;Daniela, perhaps it&#39;s best if you step outside to talk with him. For Alexander to come unannounced like this, it must be something crucial he&#39;s desperate to share with you.&#34; a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the warm,deceiving glow of the lights, Katrina&#39;s lips twisted into a sly smile, her face a mask of pretended goodwil, masking intentions far from benevolent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Alexander entered the room, his gaze had locked onto Daniela with an unyielding intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Katrina&#39;s manipulative words had backed Daniela into a corner. Certainly, she wouldn&#39;t deny him the decency of a private conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever it is you want to say, you can say it right here,&#34; Daniela replied, hervoice firm, though she kept her eyes averted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple declaration almost drove Alexander to the brink of fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze flicked to Cedric, who stood by Daniela&#39;s side, quiet yet exuding a calm confidence. Then, his eyes shifted to Ryan and Lillian, who had both stood up the moment he had walked in, their postures tense, like warriors braced for confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth came crashing down on him, as if he&#39;d been struck by an invisible force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was no longer the woman he once knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no longer the vulnerable, isolated girl who had nobody to lean on-one who could be easily swayed and taken advantage of at his convenience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of unease gripped Alexander, his hands curling into tight fists that trembled slightly at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need a moment with you. Just the two of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Daniela replied, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t engage with those who&#39;ve had too much to drink.Furthermore,there doesn&#39;t appear to be anything of such immediate concern that we should discuss this privately. If there&#39;s nothing more, Josie, would you mind showing him out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her flat refusal felt like a cold, stinging rebuff-not only to Alexander but to Katrina as well, who had been secretly thrilled about the potential spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the same woman who had once been utterly smitten with Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining an air of icy politeness, Josie held the door open and muttered, &#34;Mr. Bennett, please be careful as you leave.&#34; Her brisk dismissal was clear and final, leaving no space for protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of disappointment and shock washed over Katina. She had anticipated a fiery exchange, yet the anticipated drama had dissipated before it truly began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she just stand by?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, this seems quite harsh. Alexander dragged himself all the way here to talk to you, and you&#39;re just brushing him off like he&#39;s nothing? You didn&#39;t used to be this cold. What&#39;s gotten into you? Did Alexander somehow offend you?&#34; Katrina raised her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Alexander&#39;s gaze locked onto Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood in silence, his anticipation palpable, craving an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had changed her so profoundly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt like a stranger to him now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began to navigate through the crowd towards her, his intent clear. He extended his hand, eager to bridge the distance with a touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cedric intercepted,stepping in with a posture that shielded her from Alexander&#39;s advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression remained inscrutable, his voice low yet resolute, laced with an unmistakable caution.′′She made herself clear-if you&#39;ve got something to say, say it right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s patience snapped, frustration sharpening his tone into a piercing rebuke. &#34;How dare you try to stand in my way? Who the hell do you think you are in her life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And just who the fuck do you think you are to her? You&#39;re nothing but an ex. How many damn times do we have to go over this? She&#39;s not meeting you alone. If you&#39;ve got something to say, then fucking say it right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s demeanor was icy, his authority palpable. His voice never rose, yet it filled the room with a commanding,dangerous energy that reminded everyone of his power. His presence alone was enough to command attention, a chilling reminder of the formidable figure Cedric truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s polite charm and devoted actions towards Daniela had led everyone to believe he was a completely different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the core of Cedric&#39;s character remained unchanged-ruthless, scheming, and relentless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s muscles tensed, his hands shaking slightly as he clenched them at his sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s mouth twisted into a sly, provoking smirk. He tilted his head dismissively, regarding Alexander as if he were an insignificant bother. &#34;Or you&#39;d prefer to discuss things with me one-on-one first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, Cedric nonchalantly snapped his fingers, the crack echoing ominously, a clear signal of his thinning patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had half-expected Daniela to intervene and calm the storm brewing between the two men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela acted as though she didn&#39;t notice the drama unfolding before her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a long exhale, Katrina felt the weight of her growing anxiety settle over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the Harper family&#39;s residence, and if Cedric decided to unleash his fury on Alexander here,Richard&#39;s anger might very well be redirected at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to lighten the heavy air, Katrina forced a laugh, though a hollow one.&#34;Oh, come now! What&#39;s all this fuss about? It&#39;s freezing out there. Surely whatever it is, we can talk about it here, can&#39;t we? Alexander,go ahead. What do you need to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze remained unwaveringly on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrutinized her features, desperate to decipher any trace of emotion beneath her composed, distant demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he found nothing-no warmth, no hint of regret, nor the slightest glimmer of the affection that once filled her eyes when she looked at him. As he continued to stare, his disappointment deepened, fueled further by the alcohol swirling through his veins, intensifying his emotions. He knew he was supposed to walk away, salvage the remnants of his pride.But he was compelled to stay, driven by ar insatiable need for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension, palpable to the silent spectators gathered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s frustration reached a boiling point. Never had he imagined a time when they would communicate across such a void-she seemed utterly unattainable now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, did you ever love me?&#34; His question lingered, suspended in the heavy air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush descended over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Joyce, previously absorbed in her game, halted and turned to gaze at Alexander, her eyes wide with shock and disbelief.</p>
