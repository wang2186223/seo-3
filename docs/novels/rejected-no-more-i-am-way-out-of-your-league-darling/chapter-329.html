                <p>A dangerous glint sparked in Daniela&#39;s gaze. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, she stepped into the house to find Cedric in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes down, his face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when they found themselves in the bedroom did Cedric pull Daniela close and say, &#34;I&#39;ll be away for a two-day business trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked. &#34;Then go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worried about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed silent, choosing to be intimate with Daniela all night. He didn&#39;t stop until his secretary called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their time together spanned ten passionate hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a lingering kiss to say goodbye, Cedric left the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted, Daniela slept for a full day and night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Cedric&#39;s goal was to wear her out completely, so that she wouldn&#39;t go out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally regained her bearings, Daniela made her way downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous grin, Lillian commented,&#34;Daniela, is Cedric so worried about you going out on your own that he did this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, closing her eyes for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really that obvious? Did Cedric&#39;s concern show so plainly to everyone around her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, she went to work. On her way downstairs, she crossed paths with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t exactly a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had come to see Daniela. After pausing for a while, he approached, clearly hoping to exchange a few words with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as his eyes caught the scarf around her neck,he couldn&#39;t ignore the red mark hidden just behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp twinge seized Alexander&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, he stepped in front of Daniela,blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Alexander began, his voice heavy with emotions that swirled in his dark eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words caught in his throat, leaving him unsure of what to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though someone had carved out a piece of his soul, leaving an aching void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the point of regret now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, he couldn&#39;t help but think he had been utterly foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Divorcing Daniela had been his greatest mistake. He had already confessed his remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even with that admission, why did it feel like a second chance was forever out of reach?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander felt as though a blade had pierced straight through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears threatened to spill from his reddened eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; he whispered after what felt like an eternity, his voice trembling. &#34;Could you wait for me just a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver. She didn&#39;t even bother to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, love that arrived too late was worthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And truthfully, Alexander had never held her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silently, Daniela stepped around him and walked away, leaving him frozen in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood there, watching her disappear into the distance. A cold, hollow despair seeped into him,numbing everything else. &#34;You might not know, but Daniela is with Cedric now.Yesterday, when he was supposed to leave for a business trip, they stayed locked in their bedroom all day and night. She only came downstairs today. I&#39;m sure you can guess what they wNere doing.&#34; Katrina appeared unexpectedly, a sly smirk tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re already living together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, amused laugh escaped Katrina. &#34;Well, of course. I&#39;ve always thought their relationship seemed a little too comfortable. Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they&#39;re married by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not possible,&#34; Alexander said, his denial almost frantic. &#34;Daniela isn&#39;t the type to act on impulse like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, Alexander clung to the selfish belief that any moment of weakness Daniela had should be reserved for him alone, not shared with another man.He refused to let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Alexander&#39;s struggle unfold, Katrina gave a slow, almost sinister smile. With a mocking sigh, she added with false sympathy, &#34;Honestly, Cedric can&#39;t hold a candle to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s words were so fake that after thinking for a long time, she couldn&#39;t come up with a single reason Cedric was any less than Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she said gently, &#34;You and Daniela share years of history. Back when she was chasing after you, Cedric was just a classmate. She picked you. It&#39;s just that somewhere along the way, things fell apart. Now, her focus is elsewhere. Still, I always thought it was a shame. Back then, she hid her true identity from you. But now, living with Cedric, she&#39;s openly the CEO of Elite Lux. You never got to experience her best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her words made Alexander realize his emotions had slipped out of control. Quickly regaining his composure, he replied coldly, &#34;There&#39;s no need for these insinuations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You misunderstand me,&#34; Katrina said smoothly, her voice laced with feigned innocence. &#34;What wouldI gain by doing that? I&#39;m genuinely speaking out of concern. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly, Alexander gave Katrina a skeptical look. &#34;What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want to live under the same roof as Daniela, I know a way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion flickered in Alexander&#39;s gaze, but he didn&#39;t outright reject Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina smiled knowingly. &#34;Stay at my place for now.I&#39;ll tell everyone I&#39;m introducing you to my niece. That way, you&#39;ll have an excuse to stay close.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression didn&#39;t soften. He wasn&#39;t so easily swayed. &#34;What&#39;s the catch?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want the Harper family&#39;s villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a moment to consider, then nodded.&#34;Alright, it&#39;s a deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied smile played on Katrina&#39;s lips as she continued, &#34;Pack your things and move in. Cedric&#39;s not home today, so it&#39;s the perfect time. Oh, and just a little tip: don&#39;t always wear that serious expression.Girls these days aren&#39;t into that. You&#39;ve got to soften up and show some care. Daniela&#39;s got her own wealth now; don&#39;t expect her to pamper you as she did before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t say a word, but he understood exactly what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had changed into someone entirely different,someone with influence and a solid foundation behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she had once been married, her newfound status had only elevated her alure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Alexander afford to be careless now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, he moved back into the Harper family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Daniela wasn&#39;t there to welcome him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched with a cold stare as Alexander carried in his luggage, her face set in a frown.</p>
