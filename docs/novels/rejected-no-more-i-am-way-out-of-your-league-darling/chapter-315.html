                <p>The debt collectors had waited through the day and night, yet Daniela remained insíde her home</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce understood that Daniela would not trust her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a desperate move to draw Daniela out, Joyce clenched her teeth and jumped from the second-floor window of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident prompted an immediate call from the hospital to the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid; after a pause filled with stunned silence, rushed to alert Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Harper, Joyce has jumped from the building! The doctor requires a family member&#39;s consent for her surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied icily, &#34;How convenient. Isn&#39;t her mother already there in the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid, still agitated, said, &#34;They can&#39;t find her mother at the moment. You should go to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, recalling Joyce&#39;s earlier words, began to sense a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk crossed her face quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then went upstairs to change clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, learning that Daniela had departed the villa brought Joyce a sharp intake of relief</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her risky decision to jump hadn&#39;t been futile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the road, Daniela&#39;s driver noted, &#34;There&#39;s a car following us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela checked a message from Lillian and responded with composed assurance,&#34;&#34;UJnderstood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially,the mysterious car maintained its distance. It then suddenly accelerated, cutting off and halting Daniela&#39;s car in the street&#39;s center, drawing the attention of bystanders as other vehicles quickly dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One vehicle that had passed returned with a sharpU-turn</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Daniela&#39;s frown deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,a man with a scarred face demanded loudly,&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, Alexander emerged from his car, impetuous as always.&#34;What are you doing?This is a public road!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela momentarily shut her eyes, frustrated by Alexander&#39;s reckless bravado.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His confrontation diverted the thugs&#39; focus from Daniela to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pointed at the leader. &#34;What&#39;s your business here? Don&#39;t block the road. Move on immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s biceps bulged with menace as he snarled, &#34;This doesn&#39;t concern you. Back off!&#34; His threatening stance made him appear particularly formidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood firm. &#34;I am not afraid even if there are more of you.&#34; He glanced quickly at Daniela and yelled, &#34;Daniela, go! Get out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader&#39;s gaze darkened with murderous intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know each other?&#34; he asked Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While seated in her car, Daniela responded coolly,&#34;I don&#39;t know him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously,Alexander exclaimed, &#34;How could I not? She&#39;s my ex-wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the glint of a blade outside, she quickly exited the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander threw himself right into harm&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader paused, shocked by the blood now on his ownhand. He cursed angrily,′′Areyou out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, holding his abdomen and kneeling in pain, still tried to sound heroic. &#34;Daniela, run!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader looked at Alexander skeptically. &#34;This isn&#39;t a movie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to tolerate more, he knocked Alexander out with a single punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The area finally calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want to feel the knife, or will you get in the car yourself?&#34; the scar-faced man asked Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a slight smile. &#34;I&#39;Il get in, but first | need to speak to my driver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scar-faced man eyed Daniela&#39;s serene expression suspiciously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned towards the driver and instructed, &#34;Take the car to a car wash. Don&#39;t let the blood stain the seats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man sneered, &#34;You might not even return, and you&#39;re worried about keeping the car clean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining calm, Daniela said, &#34;I&#39;m a bit of a neat freak,so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the cold blade away from her neck. &#34;Keep that away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composed demeanor unsettled the scar-faced man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suspected she was plotting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing her frail appearance and doubting her capability to fight, he said, &#34;Stop acting tough and get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela got into the car without any protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the vehicle began to move, a bloodstained hand grabbed the door.&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Alexander demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scar-faced man frowned and was about to push him off when Daniela stated calmly,&#34;|′dhurry if I were you. It looks like the traffic police are here.&#34;The vehicle had been stationary for too long, drawing attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander reached for Daniela, but the scar-faced man took advantage of the moment to pull Alexander into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;ve got this,&#34; Alexander said as he entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made everyone in the car laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast to Alexander, Daniela stayed calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They blindfolded her and drove off to an undisclosed location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through the journey, she spoke up, her voice firm yet polite. &#34;Sorry, but this blindfold is too tight.Could you loosen it a bit?&#34;</p>
