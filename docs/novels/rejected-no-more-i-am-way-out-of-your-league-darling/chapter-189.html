                <p>Caiden&#39;s anger raged on, his furious voice carrying up from downstairs, barely softened by the thin walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! If I had known things would end up like this,| would have never brought you into this world!You&#39;re just like your mother-cold and heartless.You&#39;re doomed to be alone forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat cross-legged on the floor in her room,engrossed in a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had gifted it to her, urging her to take a break and indulge in some relaxation instead of working nonstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found peace in the quiet, and Cedric had brought over eighty thousand pieces, now scattered across the floor. When Cedric knocked and stepped inside, he found Daniela on the floor, fitting pieces together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face stayed blank, void of any emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela usually had a bright, cheerful demeanor, and when she smiled, her eyes sparkled as if they could light up the entire world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with her silence and lack of expression, it felt as though time itself had come to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was in his casual clothes and sat down beside Daniela, crossing his legs as he joined her in the puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two worked in quiet harmony, exchanging pieces wordlessly until Lillian knocked on the door and announced,&#34;Time for bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Daniela glance up and give a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met Cedric&#39;s, and his face softened into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Daniela inquired. Cedric leaned in slightly, and for a moment, Lillian thought he was about to kiss Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped just in front of her, and Daniela stayed still, unmoved by his proximity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Daniela blinked, the overhead light casting a delicate shadow over her eyelashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed silent and rubbed his hands together before gently pressing his warm palms against Daniela&#39;s ears, a soothing gesture to warm her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained motionless, her eyes locking with Cedric&#39;s, their faces just inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but notice the sharp, straight line of Cedric&#39;s nose and how appealing his lips looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just trying to warm up your ears,&#34; Cedric said with a smile. &#34;Don&#39;t let those harsh words affect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes were fixed on Cedric&#39;s smiling lips, her mind free of any distractions. All she could think was how charming his smile was.His voice was soft and pleasant. Why did people speak of him as someone to fear? He didn&#39;t seem that way at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Noticing her distraction, Cedric pressed his forehead against hers. &#34;Many people say I&#39;m lucky.Lucky to glide through life on my own, lucky to thrive in business, lucky that every investment has worked out. I never used to believe in luck, but now l think I do. I actually feel like I&#39;m really lucky, and I realize why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, feeling the luck of meeting Daniela again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric grinned. &#34;I&#39;m passing on some of that good luck to you. From now on, each day will be smooth and safe for you, Daniela. You won&#39;t be alone forever,I promise. No matter what others say, I&#39;ll always be by your side. Don&#39;t be afraid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked slowly at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Cedric felt the delicate brush of her long eyelashes against his heart, sending a small flutter through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not afraid,&#34; Daniela replied. &#34;I&#39;ve never been afraid of being alone. Those words don&#39;t affect me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile widened at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a bold step and risking being rejected, he nudged his nose against Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was cool to the touch, but more than that,it sent a stirring warmth through his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded with a smile, &#34;Then you&#39;re amazing. I&#39;m not as strong as you. I was worried you might be scared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, he slowly pulled back from her,adding, &#34;But I&#39;m absolutely terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t used to offering comfort or saying the right things. Maybe she used to be good at saying kind things, but over the years, as she was repeatedly ignored, she gradually realized that no one would acknowledge her efforts, so she forgot how to do it. In this moment, however, she clearly felt Cedric&#39;s reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze, then, copying Cedric&#39;s earlier gesture, she rubbed her hands together before leaning forward to cover his ears. &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid,&#34;she whispered.</p>
