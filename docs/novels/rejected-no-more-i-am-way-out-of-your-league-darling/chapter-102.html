                <p>Katrina passed the phone to Daniela, and she accepted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I admit it&#39;s my mistake,&#34; Alexander explained,his tone casual and distant, as if the issue didn&#39;t matter much to him. &#34;That sketchbook was worn out,and frankly, it wasn&#39;t worth much. I&#39;l have a better one sent to you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, he spoke again, clearly thinking the matter was settled. &#34;A few days ago, my dad mentioned he visited you. He suggested I invite you for a meal. When would be a good time? Let&#39;s call it my way of saying sorry. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence filled the room. Everyone&#39;s gaze was fixed on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coldness in her posture, the way her hand tightened at her side-it was clear she was fuming,a storm of emotions brewing under her still exterior,though she remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden bit his lip, stepping closer to console her.&#34;Daniela, I understand how important that sketchbook was to you.I...&#34; &#34;Fine.&#34; Daniela&#39;s unexpected reply interrupted him,her voice steady but surprising. She gave a slight smile and spoke into the phone. &#34;Let&#39;s meet at Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the calI without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,watching her closely, scoffed loudly.&#34;Oh,so now you&#39;re playing hard to get, huh? All that nonsense about how precious that sketchbook was to you-what a joke. The truth is, you were just looking for any excuse to get close to Alexander again, weren&#39;t you?Don&#39;t try to fool anyone, Daniela. You&#39;re still the same pathetic girl, desperate to follow Alexander around like some eager little puppy, hoping for his attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s words were laced with venom. &#34;If this was your plan all along, why bother with all the drama?Daniela,you disgust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela casually threw the phone into Katrina&#39;s arms,her gaze unblinking. She leaned in closer, her voice low enough for only the two of them to hear. &#34;You&#39;re right about one thing. I came here just to disgust you After the meal with Alexander, do you honestly think your plan to marry Joyce into the Bennett family is still going to succeed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft, unsettling laugh, the kind that didn&#39;t resemble the sweet girl everyone was familiar with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina, I couldn&#39;t care less about what you&#39;ve done before. But this time, you&#39;ve gone too far. Don&#39;t worry,I won&#39;t deal with you. I&#39;ll let you stay alive long enough to watch what happens to Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela turned and walked away,leaving Katrina standing there in stunned silence. Her hands clenched intofists, and her voice trembled with fury as she shouted after her, &#34;How dare you! Daniela,how dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words echoed in the stillness, but Daniela didn&#39;t so much as spare a glance. Without hesitation, she slid into her exclusive, limited-edition car and sped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Peyton descended the stairs, her gaze wandered toward Joyce&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was a perfect blend of princess-like elegance,filled with sunlight. It was spacious and airy,with floor-to-ceiling windows that opened up to a verdant greenbelt. Fresh air streamed in, rejuvenating anyone who entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton snapped her head towards Caiden, shooting him a cold look. &#34;Caiden, you really went all out raising someone else&#39;s daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt, on the other hand,were only concerned with one thing. &#34;Mom, do you think Daniela will keep her word? When do you think she&#39;ll make it happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was about a future of endless wealth and luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peyton&#39;s wrinkled face twisted into a displeased frown.&#34;Didn&#39;t you notice the way she was acting today? She was in a terrible mood. Just give her some time.I&#39;ll take some fruit and visit her at work. Did you see? She didn&#39;t even argue with a single thing I said earlier.Trust me, she&#39;s wealthy now, and you&#39;re her uncles. Do you really think she&#39;d hold back from helping you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt visibly relaxed, their tense expressions softening with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina wasn&#39;t as easily comforted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Caiden, her voice edged with concern.&#34;Caiden, what do you think Daniela meant by what she said? Is she trying to destroy Alexander and Joyce&#39;s relationship? She is, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained composed, his tone steady. &#34;You&#39;re reading too much into it. Daniela isn&#39;t like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not like that? She said it herself! She told me exactly what she was planning. And the way she looked at me -her eyes were cold, full of calculation,ruthless!Daniela is Brylee&#39;s daughter! She&#39;s got that same blood running through her veins. With a mother like  Brylee, how could Daniela possibly be anything but trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s anxiety grew stronger as she continued,&#34;You have to understand, Caiden. Daniela really said it. She promised she wouldn&#39;t touch me, but then she made it clear she wants me to witness Joyce&#39;s destruction firsthand. She&#39;s planning to ruin our daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible. Daniela is my daughter too. She wouldn&#39;t harm Joyce,&#34; Caiden responded flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina collapsed into tears. She cursed Peyton,Caiden, and Daniela even more fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed, Caiden snatched his phone and retreated to the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina went to the balcony with a cigarette dangling between her fingers. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s something really off about Caiden lately. He&#39;s not acting like himself at all.&#34;</p>
