                <p>While Daniela was in her office, Shadow suddenly appeared before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, startled by Shadow&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric&#39;s personal bodyguard, Shadow would typically be inseparable from him unless something urgent had occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has something happened to Cedric?&#34; Daniela asked,her expression concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow stood before her, dressed in black,her pale face contrasting starkly with the sunlight streaming in,looking like an vampire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recently, there have been frequent unfamiliar visitors at Phillips Group. I believe they are here for Cedric. They appear to be assassins from Oiscoll, but they haven&#39;t made their move yet. With Hamilton&#39;s five sons arriving in Olisvine soon, Cedric&#39;s safety could be compromised. I anticipate they might make a move against him shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent for a brief moment before responding, &#34;Understood. I&#39;lltake personal responsibility for Cedric&#39;s protection.&#34; After a pause, Shadow continued, &#34;Is Hamilton aware that Cedric is his son? If he doesn&#39;t know, informing him might secure Cedric&#39;s inheritance rights as the eldest son and ensure his protection from Hamilton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression was neutral. &#34;Whether or not Cedric acknowledges Hamilton is up to him. My priority is to ensure Cedric feels no pressure in deciding his familial relations. If he chooses to accept his father,so be it; if not, then he won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was steadfast in her support for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow raised an eyebrow. &#34;I had thought you would not mind his business anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up at Shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow let out a chuckle. &#34;Haven&#39;t you lost your memories? Maybe it&#39;s time to have a new boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight smirk. &#34;Thank you, but no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadow left as silently as she had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, standing in his office and looking down, was jolted from his thoughts by the sudden ring of his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela? What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing what Daniela had to say, he repeated, &#34;You want me to work in your office? Unfortunately,that&#39;s not possible right now. I&#39;m currently engaged in a significant deal with Nikolas McCoy from Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he said that, Daniela remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; Cedric asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, everything&#39;s fine. He&#39;s quite the skilled businessman. Go ahead and have your secretary prepare a temporary workspace for me in your office then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric expressed his confusion. &#34;Are you planning to work in my office? You&#39;ve been extremely busy with Elite Lux lately. If you come now, we&#39;ll need to shuffle a lot of paperwork. Maybe it&#39;s best if you wait until this busy period is over, and then I can set up space for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded indifferently, &#34;Either you agree, or we can forget the whole arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Cedric agreed. &#34;Okay. I&#39;ll come over and help set things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then went to Elite Lux and later returned to Phillips Group carrying only Daniela&#39;slaptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that all you brought? Just a laptop?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Cedric frequently visited Elite Lux, and Daniela would occasionally come to Phillips Group, though her visits were brief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s all I need.&#34; Daniela set up the laptop on the workspace Cedric had arranged and settled down on the sofa to play video games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Employees at Phillips Group passed by, puzzled by Daniela&#39;s casual demeanor despite the bustling activity at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spent a whole week like this. Other than playing games, she either slept or worked on her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric finally asked, &#34;Is it okay to stay idle like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While deeply focused on her game,Daniela murmured,&#34;The guy hasn&#39;t shown up yet, so there&#39;s nothing much for me to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was puzzled. &#34;Sorry, what was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, deeply engrossed in her game, didn&#39;t reply,and Cedric decided not to press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By lunchtime, Daniela showed little interest in food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her appetite and mood hadn&#39;t been the same since the explosion incident, prompting Cedric to cook something for her himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t bother. I&#39;m just not hungry right now,&#34; she said. Cedric glanced at Daniela&#39;s frail figure and silently devised a plan to improve her health within the next six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why have you suddenly decided to work here at Phillips Group?&#34; Cedric asked. &#34;You were so distant before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did come, but there was no added warmth in her demeanor.She remained just as indifferent as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed a break fromthe office at Elite Lux, so l thought a change of scenery might help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, an employee from Phillips Group came in to deliver a work update.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her words, they paused and chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talented people were appreciated everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s schedule had been especially busy recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group was negotiating its first major business deal with Nikolas, promising profits exceeding 50billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group was on full alert, making preparations for Nikolas&#39; arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, Mr. McCoy&#39;s secretary sent an email.They&#39;ll land at the private airport next Monday at 8 A.M. and should arrive here by 9 A.M. said the employee</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded, making arrangements for their reception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time everything was in place, Daniela had already drifted off to sleep at her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric spoke in a hushed tone, directing everyone to leave.</p>
