                <p>Alexander had never anticipated the icy chill in Daniela&#39;s demeanor towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was in a daze for a long time, his expression vacant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he walked out of the villa, he still hadn&#39;t come to his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until someone suddenly gave him a hard pull that he snapped back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Katrina, her face etched with indignation, her voice a fiery burst of anger. &#34;Daniela&#39;s a fucking monster. There&#39;s no line she won&#39;t cross!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a pang of heartache, Alexander struggled to compose himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were too scattered to entertain Katrina&#39;s grievances, and just as he turned to leave, she stepped in, cutting him off. &#34;If you walk away now, you&#39;re sealing your fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander built his life on pride, but today, he felt the bitter sting of humiliation as if someone had torn it from him. &#34;Why should I even bother staying? She&#39;s made it clear she wants nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina offered a thin, almost mocking smile. &#34;So that&#39;s it? You&#39;re just giving up? Remember how Daniela fought for you once? Where&#39;s your resolve now? Think it over. If you go now, there&#39;s no coming back-this is the end for you and Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter taste filled his mouth, but the memory of Daniela&#39;s unwavering support despite his silent treatment sparked a flicker of warmth in his weary heart. &#34;What do you suggest I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes glinted with a mix of resolve and strategy.&#34;There&#39;s a guest wing near the villa, with five vacant rooms. Stay there with us. It&#39;s a start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander nodded. &#34;Fine.&#34; Katrina tilted her head slightly and insisted, &#34;You need to be more patient. Otherwise, why would she be drawn to you? Besides, you were in the wrong before. Swallowing a bit of pride won&#39;t kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned away, his gaze drifting towards the brightly-lit villa in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A determined spark flickered in his eyes as he silently vowed that one day, Daniela would personally invite him to take his place there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric returned, his first encounter was with Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, what&#39;s the deal between you and Daniela now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s heart thudded faintly, haunted by the nagging fear that they might already be married,and he needed to confirm his suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Cedric asked instead of answering his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The directness of his question threw Alexander off balance. He remembered a time when Cedric never had the confidence he was showing now. This newfound assertiveness, as if he had already claimed both Daniela and the villa as his own, unnerved Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you two dating?&#34; Alexander asked. &#34;Or are you just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could get another word in, Daniela pushed open the door and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the two men standing side by side,her eyebrow arching inquisitively. &#34;I&#39;ve got to go to work. Now that you&#39;re back, why don&#39;t you rest for a bit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had returned after cramming two days&#39; worth of work into just a day and a half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply nodded, watching as Daniela strode towards the parking lot, her steps in sync with Lillian&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Cedric stepped back into the villa, Alexander bolted outside, chasing after Daniela&#39;s fading presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander only managed to catch up with Daniela once she had already arrived at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, Cedric already told me about everything,&#34;he declared, blocking her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed him with a blend of fatigue and indifference. &#34;If you find yourself with this much free time, perhaps you should invest it in your own company&#39;s affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander locked eyes with her, his gaze sharp and unwavering. &#34;Cedric told me you two are just that kind of relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression unchanging, Daniela responded evenly, &#34;And what kind would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You two are merely sexual partners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped her. &#34;Well, if that&#39;s what he&#39;s told you, then I suppose you have your answer.&#34; As she spoke, Alexander&#39;s mind scrambled to weave this new information into his narrative of her-Daniela, ever the romantic obsessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, she had been hopelessly entangled with him;now, it seemed, she was in love with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Comforted by this thought, his initial worries began to dissolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I understand you&#39;re a mature woman now,but such fleeting relationships seldom last. Marriage offers more stability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela eyed Alexander with incredulity, her gaze sharp as if sizing up a man who&#39;d lost his sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, always keen to assume the role of the wise mentor, now basked in a newfound sense of superiority, knowing Daniela had unfulfilled desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grandiose flourish, he posed a question,draped in an air of generosity. &#34;Have you ever considered that perhaps I might be a better fit for you than Cedric?&#34; Amused by his audacity, Daniela quirked an eyebrow.&#34;A better fit for what, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flickered across Alexander&#39;s face, his patience fraying as he mistakenly thought Daniela was feigning ignorance. &#34;For an intimate relationship.I believe I&#39;m far more suited for you than Cedric.We&#39;d be remarkably compatible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was a sarcastic sneer, her amusement turning to disdain. &#34;Let me get this straight-you just trashed this kind of relationship,and now you&#39;re eagerly signing up for it? Are you always this full of shit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her sharp words, Alexander&#39;s cheeks flushed a bright red. &#34;Yes, but that doesn&#39;t apply to me.Daniela, we&#39;ve been in each other&#39;s lives for what feels like forever. You know the kind of man I am.l would never harm you or use you for my own gains.Moreover, entering into this kind of relationship could be our stepping stone to something more permanent, like marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, his voice taking on a tone of benevolence. &#34;And let&#39;s not forget, I&#39;m willing to overlook your past with Cedric. But should we move forward together, I expect you to show the same integrity and not entertain his advances anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter echoed in the crisp morning air,unrestrained and clear. &#34;Hearing you talk like this-it&#39;s almost like listening to a comedian at work.&#34;</p>
