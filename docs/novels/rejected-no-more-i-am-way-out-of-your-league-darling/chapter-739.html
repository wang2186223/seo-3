                <p>Daniela replied with a fake smile, &#34;You&#39;re welcome to stay for lunch, but I hope no one here will make my husband uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze locked with Hamilton&#39;s, piercing and unyielding, and her words carried a warning. &#34;My temper can be fierce, and my protective instinct for my loved ones is strong. If anyone makes my husband unhappy, I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re twice as miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air seemed to thicken as Hamilton&#39;s previously pleasant expression darkened into a grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to one side, Charles was a portrait of anxiety, his entire body quivering. Hamilton&#39;s, secretary kept his gaze lowered, his hands balled into fists, white-knuckled and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense silence cloaked the room, thick and unyielding. The moment was broken when Cedric appeared from the kitchen, carrying a steaming dish. Daniela waved her hand gracefully, signaling the others to gather around the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton strode in, embodying an aura of calculated dominance. He surveyed the room with a critical eye,his expression softening slightly as he nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The decor here has a refined elegance, devoid of the garish extravagance typical of the nouveau riche,&#34; he noted, his tone carrying a note of genuine admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela settled into her chair with a nonchalant grace. &#34;I simply embrace Cedric&#39;s preferences,&#34; she replied evenly, the underlying message clear-Cedric&#39;s taste was superior to that of the Hamilton family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Daniela taken her place at the table than Hamilton&#39;s face clouded over. He placed his fork down with a deliberate, resonant clack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary reminded Daniela, &#34;In the McCoy family, everyone else must wait until Mr. McCoy finishes his meal. It&#39;s also customary for the younger ones to show respect by serving Mr. McCoy during the meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Charles positioned himself dutifully by Hamilton&#39;s side and put the fork back before Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric brought out another dish from the kitchen.After that, he told Daniela, &#34;Go ahead and sit down.I&#39;ve prepared all your favorite dishes. The soup will be right out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela acknowledged his efforts with a grateful nod and settled into her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Hamilton&#39;s gaze turned icy,his eyes narrowing as he scrutinized Cedric and Daniela, who seemed oblivious to his expectations of decorum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, undeterred, returned promptly with the soup and took his seat next to Daniela. He served her with a tender gesture, coaxing her to try a bite.&#34;Taste this and tell me what you think.&#34; Casually, Daniela engaged Hamilton, &#34;Please, feel free to help yourself. Enjoy anything you like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s response was a chilling glare, his voice laced with disdain. &#34;Is this what you call hospitality?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could muster a reply, Daniela intercepted, &#34;Why? Aren&#39;t the dishes to your liking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton opened his mouth to retort, but Daniela didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;Personally, I&#39;ve always found my husband&#39;s cooking to surpass anything else available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, taken aback by Daniela&#39;s use of the term &#34;husband,&#34; stared at her, stunned. &#34;Your husband?Are you referring to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up as she responded casually,&#34;The shrimps today are quite delightful. Could you peel one for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a beaming smile, Cedric gladly obliged,plucking a shrimp from the platter for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Hamilton watched the exchange,his eyes narrowing with pure disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was crystal clear to him-Daniela commanded the household, wielding an effortless authority, while Cedric played the part of a decorative spouse,seemingly content in his subservient role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, whose reunion with Cedric was marked more by obligation than affection, had harbored no illusions of a heartfelt welcome. Still, Cedric&#39;s stark indifference to his presence and his wealth struck a bitter chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lunch, a scene of veiled tensions, was proving intolerable for Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the strained conversation, Charles found himself the target of several sharp-tongued jabs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more uncomfortable moments,Hamilton&#39;s patience wore thin. &#34;I&#39;ve lost my appetite,&#34; he declared icily, pushing his chair back with a scrape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He strode away from the table, his steps heavy. As he paused, glancing back, he noted with growing irritation that neither Daniela nor Cedric showed any sign of concern. His expression darkened further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to sense the mounting tension, Charles rose swiftly and approached Daniela, bending slightly to murmur in a hushed tone, &#34;My father&#39;s furious. So who&#39;s stepping up to calm him down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela flashed Charles a thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; expression morphed into one of bewildered confusion.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always knew the McCoy brothers were tightly reined in when it came to power and money, but witnessing it firsthand today-it&#39;s not just restraint;it&#39;s as if you&#39;ve relinquished every ounce of your individuality!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; face twisted into a grimace, like he&#39;d just bitten into something sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Daniela pressed on. &#34;You aren&#39;t just fulfilling the role of sons; you&#39;re groveling like servants.&#34;Their exchange carried across the room, just loud enough for Hamilton to overhear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s jaw hung open in utter astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles, flustered to the core, nearly bolted towards Daniela to silence her, only stopping when Cedric&#39;s icy stare pinned him back like a butterfly in a display case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining some composure, Charles remarked,&#34;Daniela, your audacity knows no bounds. I bet it&#39;s been years since anyone dared to speak of my father in such a brazen manner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile was sly, a hint of mischief playing at the corners of her lips. &#34;Perhaps if you weren&#39;t so preoccupied with waiting for his fortune, you could speak your mind too, even right to his face. Charles is this inheritance truly worth the price of your dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton, who had been lingering just a few paces away, absorbed every word of Daniela&#39;s incitement for rebellion against paternal authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh of frustration, his patience snapped. His eyes shut in a moment of weary resignation before he called out sharply, &#34;Daniela!Come here. I need to speak with you.&#34;</p>
