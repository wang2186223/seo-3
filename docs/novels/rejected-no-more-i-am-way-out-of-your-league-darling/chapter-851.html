                <p>Daniela fought to keep the fear from taking over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused with her eyes closed, forcing herself to remember she had the tranquilizer in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand reached out, searching for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could grasp the tranquilizer, Alexander lunged forward and flung the bag off the edge without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still stubborn, I see,&#34; he said, lifting his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood streamed down from his wrist. Something unhinged had taken over. His eyes were locked on her drained face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? It hurts. But at the same time,it feels perfect.&#34; His fingers brushed her cheek. &#34;Are you uncomfortable now? I talked to a doctor before.They said the mind can&#39;t process this kind of damage. It spreads through your body like poison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced her down, his eyes sharp and erratic. &#34;You used to talk back so much. Now you&#39;re quiet. I prefer it this way. Don&#39;t worry, Daniela. I won&#39;t hurt you. We used to be something,remember? Let&#39;s finish what we never started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flared with fury. &#34;Try it, and I&#39;ll kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dripped as he raised his wrist again, the drops landing on her face without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself to shut it all out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt him begin to unbutton her blouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held her breath, trying to find a place in her mind where none of this was real. She wanted to ignore the feeling of blood sliding across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wouldn&#39;t stop. It fell faster, colder. Her control slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep inhale, she forced her eyes open again.He was leaning in. Closer than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric approached one of the staff and lifted his phone. &#34;Could you help me find mny wife?&#34; The screen showed a photo of Daniela smiling. It was set as his wallpaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a nearby table, Hamilton gestured subtly. The waiter gave a small nod and quietly stepped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the panic, Cedric?&#34; Hamilton said, flashing an easy smile. &#34;She&#39;s probably fixing her makeup. That takes more than five minutes. You&#39;re watching her too closely. That&#39;s not always a good thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t bother to answer. His eyes stayed on the glass, scanning the crowd beyond</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his agitation, Hamilton motioned toward his secretary The man stepped forward right away.&#34;Mr Phillips, Mr. McCoy hopes you&#39;ll reconsider. We&#39;d like you to accept your position as McCoy Group&#39;s heir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s jaw tightened. He rose from his seat. &#34;Not interested. Choose someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile faltered. His tone sharpened &#34;Choose someone else? You&#39;re throwing away something most people would beg for. You&#39;d inherit more than just wealth. Billions, Cedric. And you won&#39;t even listen to the lawyer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without replying to that, Cedric waved at Carol.&#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol asked in confusion, &#34;Didn&#39;t she go looking for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Cedric&#39;s face darkened. He became serious and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slowly and looked Hamilton dead in the eyes. &#34;Where is my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The power behind his voice stunned even Hamilton.For a second, he couldn&#39;t speak. Then, a flicker of pride crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the kind of presence the McCoy successor should have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no idea,&#34; said Hamilton, waving it off. &#34;She&#39;s probably catching up with someone. Look at what&#39;s in front of you. This offer I&#39;m making-it&#39;s not temporary.I&#39;m giving you everything. The future of the McCoy family will rest on your shoulders. All of it is yours.That matters far more than one woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t flinch. He spoke again. &#34;Where is my wife?&#34;His voice this time was like steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Hamilton said again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned and walked away. Just before stepping through the door, he paused. &#34;You better pray she&#39;s unharmed.If she&#39;s not, I&#39;ll kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face twitched with anger as he watched Cedric leave. &#34;You&#39;ve turned down more than you realize,Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cedric didn&#39;t even stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,with a quiet sigh, Hamilton muttered, &#34;Still too young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s chest tightened.Something felt wrong. Too many people had started to use Daniela&#39;s vulnerabilities, twisting them for their gain</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even that strange message had him on edge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growing sense of dread pulled at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to find her-fast</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas strolled over with a half-filled glass. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s gone,&#34; said Cedric. &#34;Daniela&#39;s missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon appeared behind him. &#34;I&#39;ll get someone to help look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol looked panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric didn&#39;t stop to talk. He headed straight to the surveillance room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the footage played,Damon leaned forward.&#34;She went to the eighth floor? That&#39;s the rooftop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened. &#34;Shit! Who is exploiting her weakness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Cedric was already gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator ride was the slowest he&#39;d ever known.Each second dragged. As soon as the doors parted,he rushed out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there she was. Daniela lay motionless on the floor Blood streaked her face. On top of her,Alexander was unbuttoning her blouse</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in Cedric snapped. He charged forward and drove a fist into Alexander&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pause,he followed with a vicious kick</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knife glinted on the floor Cedric grabbed it and pointed it straight at Alexander&#39;s eye His grip was steady. He was ready to strike. But just then,Daniela&#39;s hand closed around his sleeve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned quickly. Her body looked so small, so weak.Seeing her in that state nearly broke him His eyes burned,but no tears fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped off his jacket and covered her gently. Then he pulled out a wet tissue and wiped her face clean,taking his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands couldn&#39;t stop shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela whispered, &#34;It&#39;s not my blood.&#34;</p>
