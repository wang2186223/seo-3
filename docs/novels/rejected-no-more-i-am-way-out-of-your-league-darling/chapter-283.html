                <p>Katrina hesitated as she held out the pearl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave no visible sign of surprise, which allowed Katrina to release a quiet breath of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a look at this pearl. Caiden presented it to me on our wedding day. I never thought I&#39;d let it go,but I&#39;m in dire need of cash at the moment. What do you think it&#39;s worth? Just throw out a number; I promise I won&#39;t haggle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze remained fixed on the television, seemingly uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the echo of Katrina&#39;s plea died away, the dialogue from the television filled the expansive living room, the characters&#39; voices a stark contrast to the tense silence between the two women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Daniela&#39;s continued indifference, Katrina&#39;s heart sank, her hopes of a simple transaction fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together, contemplating her next move-to take the pearl to an auction house, though she dreaded the hefty fees that would diminish its yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Katrina was about to reach out to the auction house, Daniela&#39;s voice cut through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten million.&#34; Her tone was nonchalant, her eyes still on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elation surged through Katrina. She glanced at the pearl cradled in her palm, feeling a twinge of greed.&#34;Daniela, we&#39;re family. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit on the low side? Perhaps consider a higher offer? This piece is truly magnificent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with only a slight,enigmatic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across her, Johan reclined in his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, aren&#39;t you starting to push your luck?&#34; Unruffled as ever, Daniela maintained her usual stoic demeanor,seemingly indifferent even at home. The air tensed around Katrina; a surge of anxiety struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get upset. We&#39;re family, after all. A little more or less shouldn&#39;t matter, right?&#34; Despite her efforts to appear calm, Katrina harbored a growing fear of Daniela. &#34;How about twelve million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eight million,&#34; Daniela countered without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart skipped. &#34;Why drop the price? Daniela?&#34; She clutched the pearl more tightly. &#34;Twelve million is already under the market rate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Six million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in Katrina&#39;s stomach. &#34;This isn&#39;t fair...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes widened in dismay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed her a chilling, dismissive smile, shattering Katrina&#39;s hopes in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was icy, her composure unshaken. &#34;Katrina, you&#39;re hardly in a position to negotiate. Frankly,I&#39;m not interested in that pearl. But what about Joyce&#39;s predicament? Didn&#39;t she set your deadline for tonight to come up with the funds? Imagine what will happen if you don&#39;t deliver by tomorrow. Soon enough,the whole town will buzz with tales of your daughter and her never-ending scandals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was well aware that presenting the item at an auction would entail a longwait in line, hoping against hope for the right purchaser to come along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a process could span several agonizing weeks. Yet Joyce couldn&#39;t afford todelay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Daniela and Katrina recognized the urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Josie handed Daniela a plate brimming with fresh fruit, Daniela accepted it, then declared with a cold firmness, &#34;Four million. Say another word, and I won&#39;t give ita second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Daniela rose and made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela&#39;s retreating back, Katrina&#39;s frustration bubbled over, and she bit her lip hard, her gaze burning with indignation. Comered and out of optlons, she conceded, her voice strained. &#34;Fine! Four million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Katrina&#39;s capitulation, Daniela halted her ascent, pausing on the stairs above to cast a sweeping glance downward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a flicker of a moment, Katrina suspected Daniela remembered the pearl. It seemed Daniela always knew At was meant to be the gift from her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katrina could fully grasp the moment, Cedric took the pearl from her.&#34;I&#39;ve transferred the four million to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes darted to her phone, confirming the transaction was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t Daniela supposed to handle the payment?&#34; she asked Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t need to concern herself with paying for something so minor. I&#39;ve taken care of it.&#34; With that,Cedric turned and ascended the stairs, pearl in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Katrina clutched her phone, her fingers white from the grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of humiliation washed throuugh her-she had sacrificed her pride for the sake of money, only to be played by Daniela&#39;s manipulative games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, seemingly oblivious to the weight of his gesture, nonchalantly paid as though the amount was a mere four dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was seething with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but wonder why her own daughter hadn&#39;t married someone as influential as Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What qualities did Daniela possess that Joyce seemed to lack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Cedric, the pearl held a tumultuous history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s revelation of its story left him profoundly shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, when they were downstairs, he had only noticed her distress; he hadn&#39;t grasped the depth of her turmoil until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart heavy with empathy, Cedric enveloped her in a comforting embrace and murmured, &#34;It seems that fate has returned the pearl to you. I&#39;ve taken care of the payment, Daniela. Consider it a blessing from your mother, delivered through my hands. Please, let go of your sorrow. Remember, I&#39;m here for you, and in spirit,so is she.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Daniela retreated to her room, her spirit damnpened by the day&#39;s emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric joined her, synchronizing his nightly routine with hers in a tender gesture of solidarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only after Daniela drifted into sleep that he opened his eyes in the quiet darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fierce resolve ignited within him, casting a stark contrast to the gentleness he had just displayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had spent more than a month working on a major business deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was poised to finalize the agreement, Phillips Group unexpectedly swooped in and clinched a five-year deal with his prospective partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by this sudden turn of events, Alexander discretely passed some money to a contact at the other company,seeking clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you offend Cedric? We&#39;re far from a big player; it&#39;s unusual Cedric would notice us..There&#39;s no way it&#39;s solely because of our work. So, what&#39;s the real reason behind his sudden interest? Could it be an act of retribution against you?&#34;</p>
