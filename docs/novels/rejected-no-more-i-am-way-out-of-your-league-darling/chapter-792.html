                <p>Before heading out, Damon turned back and told Daniela, &#34;If you ever need anything, just say the word.I might not have much pull, but I&#39;ll do everything I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a silent nod in response. With that,Damon took his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly thirty minutes passed before Nikolas showed up. Without saying much, he handed Daniela a blank check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s this supposed to mean?&#34; Daniela raised a brow,confused by the gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll cover whatever expenses you&#39;ve got. Any damages, all of it. Consider it handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only made her more skeptical. She studied his face but couldn&#39;t read his intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; voice didn&#39;t waver. &#34;My father won&#39;t let this go.You need to leave Oiscoll now. I know why you came-to dig into the explosion and the person behind it. Give me a little time. I&#39;ll find out who&#39;s responsible and deal with them myself. But you have to walk away. Today. And don&#39;t come back.&#34; Daniela&#39;s gaze fell to the check again. She let out a soft, amused laugh. &#34;Let me guess You&#39;re scared Cedric might change his mind? Worried he&#39;ll come back and take his place in the McCoy family? That your claimn to the throne isn&#39;t so solid after all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed harder than Nikolas expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when he had already written off the chance of inheriting McCoy Group. Cedric had given him a shot by stepping down. And if that chance existed, then he&#39;d have to fight to protect it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong,&#34; Nikolas said at last. There was no use pretending. Daniela would see through it anyway.&#34;I&#39;m not like Cedric. I&#39;m not easygoing, and I&#39;m not willing to step aside. I&#39;ve spent everything I have trying to secure that future. People are supporting me-people who&#39;ve put their trust in me. I can&#39;t afford to lose this. But I give you my word-I&#39;ll find whoever&#39;s behind the explosion. I&#39;ll make sure justice is served.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Daniela believed him. There was something different in his eyes. A fire that hadn&#39;t been there before. But instead of accepting, she shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Nikolas asked,tension rising. &#34;You&#39;re staying? You&#39;ve got another plan? Or are you hiding some angle with the McCoy family I don&#39;t know about?&#34; Daniela met his eyes with a calm,almost amused smile &#34;I&#39;ve got no interest in the McCoy family&#39;s inheritance What I question is whether you have what it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit harder than expected. Nikolas looked thrown.&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just say your recent behavior hasn&#39;t exactly earned you Hamilton&#39;s confidence. If anything,it casts doubt on whether he still supports you at all. And if by some miracle you do end up with the title, would you even have the guts to go after the real culprit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas opened his mouth, likely to offer some promise or reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she shut it down before he could speak.&#34;What if the person behind it all is your father? You still willing to play hero then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;There&#39;s no way it&#39;s him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing&#39;s off the table. You know that. And I doubt you&#39;d have the spine to face that truth. Believe this or don&#39;t-it makes no difference to me. Cedric and I have no desire for your family&#39;s wealth or power.I&#39;ve said this before, but this will be the last time I explain myself. Don&#39;t show up offering terms you aren&#39;t qualified to make. I always settle my debts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever confidence Nikolas had walked in with had vanished He turned away shoulders heavier than when he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shook her head and commented, &#34;That guy? All ambition, no skill. He&#39;ll never get the McCoy fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Hamilton knew that. If Nikolas had truly been capable, there would&#39;ve been no need to chase after Cedric in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With growing impatience, Hamilton shouted, &#34;Have Cedric or Daniela shown up to plead their case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet,&#34; Joseph replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration laced his voice. &#34;Then come up with something else! Don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m the one who has to beg them to take over!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph hesitated, worry etched across his face. He was starting to think that might be their only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr McCoy, if this situation keeps unraveling, we may need to shift course,&#34; said another secretary</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;What exactly are you suggesting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in closer, the secretary spoke in a hushed tone. &#34;If we can&#39;t have both of them on board, then we split them. But before anything else, we need to know if Cedric can actually carry McCoy Group on his own. If he can, Daniela&#39;s presence doesn&#39;t matter,  right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow creased with doubt. &#34;Those two are inseparable How exactly do you plan to pull them apart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s more than one way Daniela had a former marriage. The man&#39;s name is Alexander Bennett 1reached out earlier-he&#39;s open to helping us.Apparently, Alexander hadn&#39;t completely let go.Whatever he still felt for Daniela might be enough to stir things up. If Daniela walks away,Cedric will need comfort. That&#39;s where we step in. A little care from the family could go a long way. He just might take the offer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamiltonfell quiet for a moment, thinking it over.&#34;Cedric&#39;s not an easy one to manipulate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would sooner bet on Daniela cracking before Cedric did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary gave a short laugh. &#34;That&#39;s only because you&#39;ve never shown him a shred of kindness. Show him a different side of you-remind him you&#39;re still his father.He won&#39;t challenge you if you stop treating him like an enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp scowl tugged at Hamilton&#39;s features.&#34;You want me to play the good guy now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod, the secretary didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;If you want Cedric in the seat, yes. Otherwise, go with Nikolas He&#39;s obedient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shut his eyes briefly, as though weighing the cost. &#34;Fine. But I&#39;m testing Cedric first. If it turns out he&#39;s only riding Daniela&#39;s coattails, then I have no use for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, the secretary didn&#39;t try to hide his optimism &#34;The decoration of the building across the street?That was all Cedric&#39;s work. A man with that kind of foresight can&#39;t be completely useless. He is your son,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment drew a reluctant nod from Hamilton &#34;Does anyone have contacts inside Elite Lux headquarters? Find someone who can bring Daniela back for a while. Then I&#39;ll see what Cedric can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Cedric was made of steel or sand, they&#39;d find out soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the secretary started to step out, Hamilton&#39;s voice dropped, low and sharp. &#34;One more thing-wipe out everything Daniela&#39;s trying to uncover. She must not find a single clue.&#34;</p>
