            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A person arrived to summon Daniela, urging her to sign a document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot a quick glance over his shoulder before turning back, his focus resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas erupted in fury and the McCoy family looked on in stunned disbelief, Cedric stood completely unfazed, his composure unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His calmness was so absolute that it bordered on coldness, making him appear detached and unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never even needed to speak these words to you,&#34;Cedric said in a tone as cold as ice, his voice carrying no trace of emotion. &#34;I don&#39;t waste my time on trivial matters. But I&#39;ll say this, just to be perfectly clear-l have no interest in the McCoy family. And if you think you can manipulate my wife, you are sorely mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having spoken his mind, Cedric raised his hand in a gesture as dignified as it was dismissive. &#34;Please, leave.I won&#39;t waste my time escorting you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final glance, he turned on his heel and began his steady ascent up the stairs. Hamilton, burning with humiliation, glared at Cedric like a wounded animal. &#34;Cedric, are you truly willing to discard your place within the McCoy family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric halted, his voice unwavering. &#34;I believe l&#39;ve made my position crystal clear&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, it felt as though Hamilton&#39;s entire world was crumbling around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could anyone be so indifferent to the empire he had painstakingly constructed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unthinkable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utterly impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Cedric&#39;s departure was unyielding, his resolve as firm as iron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by a tempest of rage and humiliation,Hamilton yelled, &#34;Cedric,you need to grasp something.If you don&#39;t adhere to my plans, you&#39;ll become my enemy. Think carefully before you make your choice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Hamilton&#39;s secretary murmured quietly,&#34;What Mr. McCoy is trying to convey is that Oiscoll&#39;s entire economic future rests firmly in the McCoy family&#39;s hands. Oiscoll is their domain. If you align yourself with them,opportunities will naturally come your way. But if you&#39;re not part of the family,you and your wife will be left with nothing.&#34; The secretary eyed Cedric with a hint of worry &#34;Cedric, you&#39;ve just arrived in Oiscoll. You have no idea yet how deep Mr. McCoy&#39;s reach runs or how he plays his cards. This isn&#39;t some petty feud with his sons. You and Daniela won&#39;t be able to weather it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze remained as steady as a calm sea. &#34;ls that so? Well, let&#39;s fnd out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had assumed that Cedric would waver after hearing the secretary&#39;s warning. He never imagined Cedric&#39;s unwavering stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face contorted with rage, his features distorting until he was almost unrecognizable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yelled at Cedric&#39;s retreating form, his voice seething with anger. &#34;Cedric, one day you&#39;ll realize that pride doesn&#39;t pay the bills! One day, you&#39;ll crawl back to me, begging to rejoin the McCoy family. But by then, it won&#39;t be as easy as it is now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet chuckle escaped Cedric as he shook his head,then resumed his ascent up the stairs with unhurried steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face drained of color. Whipping around to his sons,he snapped,&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary lingered a moment longer, then turned to leave just as Daniela entered from outside. The secretary lowered his voice to a whisper, speaking to Daniela with urgency. &#34;Ms. Harper, Mr. McCoy was seething with anger just now. This is no trivial matter You should try persuading Cedric. This is an opportunity laid out for you on a silver platter. Why not seize it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile,her voice laced with disbelief. &#34;You call thisan opportunity? Bowing and scraping to Hamilton like some puppet-this is your idea of an opportunity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary was taken aback, caught off guard.&#34;Mr.McCoy&#39;s grip is tight, but isn&#39;t it all for the sake of his sons and McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;Years ago, Nikolas loved someone deeply, but they were torn apart. Not because his love had faded, but because Hamilton deemed her family unworthy and tore them apart. As for his other sons, even the smallest details of their lives-what they eat, wear, and how they spend their days-are dictated by Hamilton. He cloaks it in the guise of doing what&#39;s best for them, all the while stripping them of their freedom. Even if Cedric ever entertained the thought of returning to the McCoy family,I would never allow him to become Hamilton&#39;s sixth puppet. Cedric is his own man. He will never bow to such control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a resigned sigh,shaking his head slowly &#34;You&#39;ll regret this &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Youth were forever driven by impulse, chasing decisions without thought of the consequences</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when they stumbled upon their own troubles would they realize the weight of their choices</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head in quiet regret, the secretary turned and walked away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Hamilton&#39;s face darkened, his voice sharp as he asked, &#34;What did Daniela say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton knew that Cedric held Daniela&#39;s words in high regard. If she intervened, Cedric would certainly come crawling back to the McCoy family,begging for forgiveness</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary chose his words carefully. &#34;Daniela said that Cedric is far too independent, and that the McCoy family isn&#39;t a suitable place for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the secretary had already softened Daniela&#39;s words, Hamilton erupted in a fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful fools! Fine! If that&#39;s how they want to play it, they can&#39;t blame me for showing no mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, calculating glint flashed in Hamilton&#39;s eyes, the darkness within him awakening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His actions were not driven by raw emotion alone In Oiscoll, only those with McCoy blood had the right to conduct business. If Cedric joined the family, he would be free to carve his own path</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if he wasn&#39;t, there would be no exceptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton would see to it that they didn&#39;t earn a single penny in Oiscoll.</p>
