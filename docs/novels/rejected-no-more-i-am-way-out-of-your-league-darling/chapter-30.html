                <p>Ten minutes later, in the downstairs living room,Joyce reclined on the couch, her tone overly sweet as she bossed the housekeeper around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These fruits are exquisite. Pack up a box for me to take home. And the fruit platter-it&#39;s stunning. I need to know where you found it. I&#39;ll take that too. Oh, and see that little table over there? It&#39;s just perfect for late -night snacks. Fold it up for me,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she issued her orders, Joyce drifted over to the large fish tank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, visibly stressed, hurried over with a forced smile. &#34;Ms. HHolt, these fish are a special gift from Mr. Phillips. I&#39;ve heard each one is valued at over twenty thousand dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s interest piqued, she glanced at Katrina, who understood her intentions immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning on Caiden&#39;s arm, Katrina remarked, &#34;Just look at Daniela&#39;s lavish setup here. This tank alone must be worth a fortune. She really indulges herself, doesn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden scoffed, &#34;She doesn&#39;t know the first thing about living sensibly. Joyce, if you fancy it, we can have someone come and collect the entire tank later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile widened, clearly pleased. She had to acknowledge,Daniela was not only wealthy but had an exceptional eye for style. Everythingin the house was curated with elegance. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyeing a nearby cabinet, Joyce&#39;s smile turned cunning.&#34;Dad, I&#39;d like that cabinet as well. It would be perfect in our place.&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper&#39;s heart dropped. &#34;This cabinet is another gift from Mr. Phillips. It&#39;s crafted from rare rosewood and was acquired at an auction. It&#39;s not really something we can just give away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina chuckled lightly, turning to Caiden. &#34;Daniela may be thriving in her career, but it seems her staff doesn&#39;t quite understand. We&#39;re all family here.Why should there be such boundaries among us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s expression hardened as he faced the housekeeper, his voice dropping to an icy,authoritative timbre. &#34;I&#39;m her father.Whatever I desire,she should be willing to provide. Even if I demanded this entire building, she&#39;d have no choice but to comply-let alone a mere cabinet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper bowed her head submissively. &#34;Yes,  sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emboldened by Caiden&#39;s declaration, Joyce&#39;s demeanor swelled with conceit. She swept her hand across the room, pointing at the lavish furnishings as though compiling a wish list on an extravagant shopping spree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Caiden with a gleeful grin, she said, &#34;Dad,I&#39;ll arrange for movers to collect these items. And while we&#39;re at it, could you convince Daniela to refurbish the 18th to 20th floors for me? I want them styled just like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper&#39;s eyes bulged, her mind reeling at the audacity. These people were beyond belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darted towards the staircase, hoping Daniela would appear soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety tightened her chest. If Daniela didn&#39;t intervene quickly, they&#39;d empty the entire house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as panic threatened to overwhelm her, a firm knock resounded through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hope sparked across the housekeeper&#39;s face, half-expecting it to be Lillian, whose gutsy demeanor might defuse the escalating situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the door swung open to reveal not Lillian,but a team of professional movers, clad in their work uniforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, did someone here request a moving service?&#34;one mover inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper peeked outside, her heart sinking as she saw over ten robust men, poised as though ready to gut the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved her hands fretfully. &#34;My employer is still resting. Could you perhaps wait a little longer? Just until-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait for what?&#34; Before she could finish, Joyce barged past her and barked at the movers, &#34;Come in!What are you waiting for? We&#39;ve been expecting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mover apologized promptly, &#34;Sorry, ma&#39;am. The traffic downtown was horrendous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce dismissed their excuse with an irritated wave of her hand. &#34;Spare me the details. Just get in here.&#34; She led them into the living room, her gestures grand and commanding as she pointed out her selections.&#34;Take that. And this. Oh, and that one over there too.The fish tank-yes, the whole thing, fish included.Move it all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movers examined the items carefully before providing a quote. &#34;Since there are live animals involved,the fee will be slightly higher. If that&#39;s alright, we can begin immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce waved them off dismissively, her tone dripping with entitlement. &#34;Go ahead and start. Bill the owner of the house for it later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movers, methodical and professional, began unpacking their equipment, ready to pack up the requested items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, now frantic, stepped forward in a last-ditch effort to intervene. &#34;No, no! This can&#39;t happen! Miss Harper still asleep. Please, at least wait until she wakes up so you can ask her first. If she consents, then fine, take what you like. But I&#39;m just the housekeeper-I don&#39;t have the authority to let this happen. If she comes downstairs to find her house stripped bare,what explanation am I supposed to give?Please,I beg you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden claimed to be Daniela&#39;s father,Katrina asserted herself as the stepmother, and Joyce proclaimed as the stepsister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused by the family dynamics, the housekeeper felt utterly helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34; Joyce snapped, her tone sharp and cutting as her glare bore into the housekeeper. &#34;I said, move these things. Didn&#39;t you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, though visibly trembling, planted herself in front of the fish tank, resolutely blocking their path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s frustration reached its boiling point.Without a second thought, she raised her hand and struck the housekeeper hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper, a woman in her fifties, stumbled under the force of the slap. Her eyes brimmed with tears, but she stood her ground, too terrified to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce seized her arm roughly, shoving her aside with a dismissive sneer. Turning back to the movers, she barked, &#34;Move it, now!&#34;</p>
