                <p>Hamilton shot a sharp glare at his secretary. &#34;What would you know? Cedric&#39;s lived simply and doesn&#39;t understand the pull of the high life. That&#39;s why he said no. But just wait. Once he tastes the luxury and glamour of the elite, he&#39;ll be hooked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded in complete agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s life was indeed much simpler than many of the wealthy people in Oiscoll. He carried himself with an unpretentious air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he frequently donned Elite Lux&#39;s bespoke.high-end suits, it was merely a reflection of Daniela&#39;s enterprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More so, he was often spotted carrying a basket of groceries, rumored to even cook himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he had yet to know the true meaning of a lavish lifestyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the siren call of wealth and luxury lured him in,changing loyalties would come effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught the secretary&#39;s approving nod and smirked with satisfaction. &#34;Mr. McCoy, what&#39;s the plan?&#34; the secretary inquired.&#34;Cedric isn&#39;t willing to leave Daniela. How do you plan to lure him into the lavish life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton smirked. &#34;Cedric is concerned about Daniela.isn&#39;t he? Just tell him McCoy Group&#39;s about to launch a major collaboration, gathering partners. I doubt he&#39;ll resist the temptation. Have our undercover at Daniela&#39;s company leak the news. Cedric will come to me willingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been pushing his buttons more times than he cared to admit lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was losing track of who held the real power-father or son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to assert his dominance over Cedric,or risk losing control down the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary asked, &#34;And Daniela? Nikolas seems unwilling to intervene. Should we find someone else to manage her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression hardened, his voice icy. &#34;Put Daniela on hold for now. Once Cedric falls for the lavish lifestyle and leaves her behind, I&#39;ll teach her a lesson and make sure she will never get too full of herself again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary chuckled. &#34;Mr. McCoy,your schemes are brilliant. No matter how strong Daniela is, she  can&#39;t slip past your reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark, sinister grin spread across Hamilton&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Arthur Avila, the marketing department manager, rapped gently on the door of Cedric and Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Cedric&#39;s vacant chair, Arthur decided to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked up and asked, &#34;Are you here for Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur nodded, gripping a file tightly. &#34;Yes. He isn&#39;t here right now, so I&#39;ll come back another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered smoothly, &#34;He&#39;s out on a site inspection this morning. What&#39;s in the file? Hand it over-I&#39;ll make sure he gets it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur forced an uneasy smile. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. He always handles this collaboration personally. I&#39;ll report to him later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t take it seriously at first. Yet Arthur&#39;s reaction spoke volumes-his face flushed like he&#39;d been caught hiding a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed Arthur with a cold, unwavering gaze,then reached out her hand.&#34;Give it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s usual chill deepened. When she locked eyes without a hint of feeling, it felt like a piercing,intimidating stare. Arthur nearly dropped the file, startled by her icy demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol frowned as she stepped closer. &#34;Why so nervous? It&#39;s just a collaboration, isn&#39;t it? What&#39;s the fuss? Is there something you&#39;re hiding from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had always been open with Daniela on business That made Arthur&#39;s nervousness all the more suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s just a minor project-not important enough to bother you with,&#34; Arthur replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had already closed the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur was left with no option but to surrender the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol handed the file over to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela studied the contents carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project showed great promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More specifically, it was perfectly suited for collaboration and quite profitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her goal in coming to Oiscoll was profit, this project would be the perfect fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadly,that wasn&#39;t her true purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project was McCoy Group&#39;s. She was already probing past issues and making headway. She wanted to avoid too deep an entanglement with McCoy Group.which could complicate things down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set the file aside and glanced at Arthur, whose nervousness was plain to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a solid project,&#34; Daniela said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur visibly relaxed, but then she added, &#34;Still, hold off on all collaborations with McCoy Group for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur looked up, surprised. &#34;Why is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol clicked her tongue. &#34;Just follow orders. Does the CEO have to explain her decisions to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arthur walked away, clearly deflated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed as she watched Arthur&#39;s heavy footsteps fade. &#34;Keep an eye on him,&#34; she told Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hamilton continued to wait patiently for Cedric to reach out.</p>
