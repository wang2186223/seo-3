                <p>As dawn broke, Caiden made his way to Harper Group,accompanied by Alexander, whose recent skin graft was visibly healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They entered the CEO&#39;s office, where Caiden nonchalantly tossed his feet onto the desk and motioned for Alexander to make himself comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander cast a scrutinizing glance around the room,his expression unreadable as he took everything in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The desk was a chaotic stack of documents needing approval, official seals, and stamps-all disorganized and scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes then caught a piece of paper on the floor.Stooping to retrieve it, he realized it was Harper Group&#39;s business license.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being aware of Caiden&#39;s lax approach to business, the level of disorder still shocked Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fuss over that,&#34; Caiden remarked casually, as he placed a steaming cup of coffee on a nearby table,settling back with a relaxed air. &#34;Daniela will be here soon to sort out this disaster. I&#39;m tired of managing  this circus; it&#39;s her turn to take the reins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a self-satisfied grin, Caiden leaned back further. &#34;If Daniela can elevate Harper Group to compete with Elite Lux, my remaining forty-nine percent stake could turn into a gold mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled, basking in the glow of his imagined future riches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sat across from Caiden. &#34;Daniela has climbed her way to the top; she&#39;s clearly capable. Do you really think she&#39;ll accept defeat without a fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments earlier,Alexander had eavesdropped on the chief financial officer detailing a grim financial reality: the company was drowning under a debt exceeding seven hundred million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only lifelines were bank loans and a handful of clients still loyal to Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the outside, Harper Group maintained its majestic facade, yet internally, it was mere shadow of its former self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander found it astonishing how effectively Caiden had managed to run the corporation into the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engrossed in his thoughts, Alexander&#39;s contemplation was interrupted by the buzz of his phone. It was a message from Caiden containing a list of contacts. Puzzled, Alexander raised his eyebrows at Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, Caiden responded, &#34;Your tip about Joyce&#39;s baby was a lifesaver, and I&#39;m grateful you joined me here today. That list? It&#39;s our last batch of solid clients. Feel free to transition their accounts to Bennett Group. Tell them I approved the move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relaxed in the glow of the well-lit office, Caiden leisurely sipped his coffee, a subtle smile playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he stood, Alexander could see Caiden&#39;s blatant disregard for Daniela, his own daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but remember the day Daniela was a drunken mess, and the Harper famnily treated her like trash left out on the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now,it seemed like the whole world had turned its back on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucking the list-a generous offering from Caiden-into his pocket, Alexander sensed the tension in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nine o&#39;clock, whispers of impending doom circulated among the employees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained detached, offering no reassurances.When they questioned him about what to do next,his  response was firm and clear. &#34;Wait for Daniela.If she&#39;s truly capable as they claim, she&#39;ll prove herself. I&#39;m eager to see if she possesses her mother&#39;s unshakable grit in crisis situations!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the clock struck ten, the secretary notified them of Daniela&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the door to the CEO&#39;s office burst open. Daniela entered, her stride confident, her presence commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was not alone; accompanying her were Ryan,Lillian, Cedric, and a lead auditor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden rose from his seat, his eyes locked on Daniela in disbelief. &#34;You&#39;ve brought an auditing team to scrutinize your own father&#39;s company? How dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the tension, Daniela walked over to the executive chair and settled into it with an air of authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Ryan, Lillian, and Cedric lined up, their faces masks of unwavering confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela began, &#34;We&#39;ve legally dissolved any familial bonds. This isn&#39;t just a family matter; it&#39;s business. And with fifty-one percent of the shares in my possession,I have full authority here. I need you to hand over every financial record and key document now. After a thorough audit and the transfer of documents, I will assume leadership of Harper Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This poised declaration took Alexander by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had never crossed his mind that Daniela might actually understand the intricacies of business affairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always presumed her accomplishments were more a stroke of fortune than expetise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what if I refuse? The company&#39;s right here. Take it if you can, or walk away.&#34; A derisive smirk twisted Caiden&#39;s lips, the frustration of being trapped evident in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was serene as she delivered her ultimatum. &#34;Each day you resist, the company will be shut down. I can absorb such losses. Can you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden glared at her, incredulous. &#34;What the hell,Daniela? You&#39;re more vicious than I ever thought you could be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cost of shutting down would bleed the company of hundreds of thousands daily. Caiden&#39;s stake in this venture was personal-he aimed to lay down a sturdy groundwork for Joyce&#39;s offspring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is standard protocol during a takeover. You&#39;ve been running this firm for a decade. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re clueless about how a handover works.Your ignorance has been apparent for too long.&#34; Daniela&#39;s  eyes then fell to the business license under Caiden&#39;s foot. &#34;Under your leadership, Harper Group nearly crumbled from a titan to ruins. We know who&#39;s responsible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, Daniela exuded an icy demeanor that made Caiden instinctively recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a flicker of emotion, she approached him,locking eyes briefly, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, reminded of Brylee by the intensity in Daniela&#39;s gaze, took a cautious step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes then dropped to the license on the floor,her voice cutting through the tension. &#34;Pick itup.&#34;</p>
