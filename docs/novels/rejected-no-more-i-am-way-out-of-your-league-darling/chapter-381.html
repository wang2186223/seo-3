                <p>Daniela glanced over her shoulder at Nina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was taken aback by how calmly Daniela handled the situation, even in such a tense moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe whatever you want about us,&#34; Daniela said,her voice steady. &#34;If we are something in your mind,then that&#39;s what we are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina quickly shot back, &#34;Really? People are saying Cedric stays here not because you love him, but because you just need a man. They say you&#39;re using him for your own desire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina matched Daniela&#39;s pace, her voice growing sharper.&#34;I think I agree.You don&#39;t love Cedric,do you?Otherwise,how could you let people gossip about him like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused at the stairs,her fists clenching at her sides.She stayed silent, contemplating for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you stay quiet, I&#39;ll take that as an admission.&#34; Nina continued,taking full advantage of Daniela&#39;s silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t care about Nina&#39;s words; she feared nothing for herself. But when it came to Cedric, it was a different story. She couldn&#39;t risk him being hurt. With everything so uncertain, she saw no value in continuing the argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed quiet, and started up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she lifted her foot, Nina&#39;s smug voice rang out behind her. &#34;Cedric, did you hear that? I told you.Daniela doesn&#39;t love you. She just admitted it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze mid-step, her heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long, tense pause, she slowly turned her head and saw Cedric standing at the entrance with his luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked drained, his eyes bloodshot, chest heaving with each heavy breath, his face full of stunned disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes locked from across the long hallway, the darkness between them seeming to stretch forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood triumphantly to the side and said, &#34;Cedric,you heard that, right? Daniela just wants a man around,which is why she let you stay here. Do you still want to stay now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina continued, &#34;Daniela, I&#39;m sorry, but if you don&#39;t love him, you should be honest. I&#39;ve only known Cedric briefly, but I can tell he values sincerity. It&#39;s not right to toy with his emotions like this.&#34; Nina said all of this, but Cedric remained silent, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent as well. She didn&#39;t know what could possibly mend the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Cedric&#39;s earlier confrontation resurfaced-he had always questioned her real intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina lingered, phone in hand, as the three of them stood in suspense, waiting for a resolution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This drama couldn&#39;t just end abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gripped the stair railing, her eyes faraway as she spoke. &#34;It&#39;s up to you, Cedric. If you want to leave,I won&#39;t stop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Daniela turned and ascended the stairs,retreating to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, she didn&#39;t sit. She waited, hoping Cedric would come up. She needed to explain herself to him.But he didn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over an hour later, the only sound she heard was the hum of a car engine starting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing on the balcony, she watched the black car disappear into the darkness. After a moment, Daniela pressed her lips tight and lowered her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit her-she had hurt Cedric deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Daniela couldn&#39;t sleep. She sat wide awake on the wooden floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Old habits were hard to shake off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had become accustomed to having Cedric by her side at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With him gone, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to crawl into bed alone. Instead, she pondered whether revealing their relationship would be the right move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would that finallymake Cedric happy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it clear away all his doubts and fears about whether she truly wanted him in her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spent the entire night mulling over this thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As morning light filtered into the villa, exhaustion clouded her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, an impulsive thought bloomed in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to shout to the world that Cedric was her husband. No more secrets, no more hiding. She couldn&#39;t wait another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly changed into fresh clothes, put on her shoes, and hurried downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A powerful impulse drove her-she had to see Cedric right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that rush of determination vanished the moment she reached the first floor. There, she saw Nina and Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Daniela,&#34; Natalie greeted her with an air of polished professionalism. &#34;I&#39;m Natalie. It&#39;s been a while.&#34;</p>
