                <p>Doug wrapped his armn around Joyce&#39;s waist, his eyes locked on Daniela as he whispered, &#34;Is that your half -sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce nodded. &#34;She&#39;s breathtaking,isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug had no desire to attend such an event, but Joyce had promised to introduce him to a beautiful woman,so he begrudgingly agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he saw Daniela, he was undeniably captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pulse quickened with excitement, and he could barely contain his eagerness to approach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He extended his hand, his voice smooth. &#34;Good evening, Ms. Harper. I&#39;m Doug Fairburne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sized up the man standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a middle-aged man with a protruding belly and thinning hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing in her high heels, Daniela was a little taller than him. She cast a quick glance at his thinning hair,then at Joyce, who was draped in jewels next to him, and offered a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s discomfort was palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Daniela trying to say with that smile? Was Daniela looking down on her? Did Daniela think she had chosen such an unappealing man purely for his wealth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s financial power allowed Joyce to be arrogant in front of everyone-except Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t summon any arrogance around Daniela,who held unmatched power in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Doug, who spent money freely, was nothing in the face of Daniela&#39;s influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce knew Doug&#39;s weaknesses. His judgment was clouded by desire. Who knew what could unfold?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, meet my husband, Doug.&#34; Joyce intentionally raised her voice, making sure the gossiping crowd heard every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fake smile stretched across Joyce&#39;s face as she waited for Daniela to extend her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain that once Doug shook Daniela&#39;s hand,he would be haunted by the encounter, eager to pursue her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she couldn&#39;t deal with Daniela directly, she&#39;d let Doug take care of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She longed to see Daniela suffer the same fate she was trapped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s smile deepened,full of malice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s hand remained outstretched, waiting for Daniela&#39;s response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the room was on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the spotlight, Daniela stood tall and smiled with poise. &#34;Apologies, I&#39;m a bit obsessive about cleanliness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s smile faltered, his expression tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Daniela&#39;s gaze flicked towards Joyce. &#34;How have you and Alexander been these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce hadn&#39;t anticipated Daniela&#39;s swift retaliation.Her face drained of color, and she quickly glanced at Doug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s expression darkened completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela maintained her smile. &#34;Doesn&#39;t your husband know about your little rendezvous while he was away?Oops, my mistake. I shouldn&#39;t have said that. Sorry.&#34;Her apology was casual, her demeanor unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce flustered, waving her hands frantically as she  tried to explain, &#34;It&#39;s not what it seems! Let me explain -Alexander is my ex-husband. We just exchanged a few words,nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Daniela asked with a smile. &#34;Then why have I seen you both going in and out of the Grand Hotel multiple times? Am I mistaken, or was that really you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her jaw, glaring at Daniela, her eyes burning with fury. &#34;Enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile barely wavered. &#34;I&#39;m only stating the truth. Is that a crime? Using your husband&#39;s money to maintain a lover isn&#39;t exactly a good look. But then again, your husband is a lot older than you, so in some areas, you might have more energy. I can see why you&#39;d need someone else to help you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela savored the drama, unconcerned with the fallout. &#34;Don&#39;t you agree,Doug?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t merely an affair-it was like publicly humiliating Doug, painting him as a fool for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug could feel the weight of everyone&#39;s eyes on him,his face contorting in humiliation for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the reminder. Excuse me,&#34; Doug muttered,yanking Joyce and, despite her protests, tossing her into the car. The car didn&#39;t pull away; instead, it rocked violently in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremors persisted until the banquet finally came to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Alexander appeared behind Daniela. &#34;Is this about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her head slightly, stepping aside.&#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t want me with Joyce, so you exposed our affair to Doug on purpose. You still care about me,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
