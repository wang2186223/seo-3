                <p>Hamilton had been at odds with Daniela lately, and the tension was wearing on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Alexander said those words, they landed like a soothing melody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low chuckle, the creases in his face deepening with the motion. &#34;Glad to hear,it. So,if I&#39;m understanding you right, you still have feelings for Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t dare dance around the question. He gave a firm nod. &#34;Yeah, I do. I always regret having divorced her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton eyed him carefully. &#34;And Daniela? Do you believe she still have feelings for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question struck a nerve-just enough to crack Alexander&#39;s composed facade. His lips pressed into a thin line before he answered,&#34;I&#39;m not sure. But she&#39;s always been the sentimental type. What we shared wasn&#39;t fake. That much is certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton paused, his expression unreadable before he replied in an even tone, &#34;I understand your intentions. If you&#39;re serious about this, I can lend a hand. But hear me on this-Cedric is my son. You&#39;re not to lay a finger on him. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded, quick and eager. &#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton waved him off with a flick of his hand. &#34;Go on, get some rest. I&#39;ll handle the plan and contact you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t argue. He turned and left without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, he stared up at the mansion,jealousy coiling tight in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric... that lucky bastard really had everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Daniela got home, Cedric was already up. The night air was heavy, streetlights throwing pale gold across the drive and carving shadows beneath the trees. Cedric sat on the villa&#39;s front steps,unmoving, clearly waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught sight of him right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her companions quietly slipped away, leaving her alone with him in the stillness of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wore nothing but a thin sleep shirt and pants,his hair tousled from sleep, a few stubborn strands sticking up and softening his usually polished demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice came out scratchy, thick with sleep.&#34;Where have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he&#39;d just rolled out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a moment to study him-the breeze tugged at his thin pajamas, molding the fabric to his lean frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing out here?&#34; she asked. &#34;I couldn&#39;t find you. The housekeeper said you&#39;d gone out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm, just had something to deal with. Come on-let&#39;s go back in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reached for his hand, and he let her guide him without protest. He asked, &#34;Where were you?Don&#39;t wander off so late. It&#39;s cold out-your hands feel like ice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered with a vague hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they walked through the,front door,they spotted three overly curious people still lounging in the living room, eyes wide and clearly fishing for drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving them so much as a glance, Daniela led Cedric straight to their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d stirred from sleep in the dead of night, needing only to confirm she was home. The moment he saw her, his body relaxed, and he slipped right back into slumber. The strain of overseeing the new company these past few weeks had clearly worn him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the edge of sleep, Daniela jolted as her phone lit up with a buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up and saw a message from an unfamiliar number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she tapped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, this is mny new number in Oiscoll.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to set the phone aside when it lit up again with another buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me know when you&#39;ve got time to meet up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anytime works for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll adjust to whatever time works for you. Just reach out when you&#39;re free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The messages kept piling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her thumb, Daniela blocked the number without a second thought. Cedric shifted groggily beside her. &#34;Who keeps texting this late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just spam,&#34; she said lightly. &#34;I blocked it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Content with her answer, Cedric slipped right back into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Daniela was buried in reports in her office when Carol marched in, arms folded tightly across her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you think something feels wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her eyes on the paperwork. &#34;What is i?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed a bunch of new faces in the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a casual shrug. &#34;Fresh company, fresh faces. What did you expect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol leaned in, frowning. &#34;That&#39;s not what I mean.All these new people look kind of alike.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment made Daniela pause. She set her paperwork aside and stood, heading downstairs to check. Carol trailed close behind, lowering her voice to a murmur. &#34;Don&#39;t you see it? Every other face in here either resembles Cedric or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill settled over Daniela&#39;s features. &#34;Or Alexander,&#34; she said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s head bobbed in agreement. &#34;Yes, that&#39;s it!But why? Did HR seriously tailor their hiring to suit your liking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a firm shake of her head.&#34;No way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had flown in the entire HR team from his hometown. There was no chance they&#39;d purposely fill the office with people who looked like Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long beat, she said nothing. Then, her eyes drifted upward, locking onto the McCoy Group building just across the street.</p>
