                <p>With a scowl, Alexander turned to leave, but Keith stopped him by grabbing his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith flashed a grin and pulled out a business card,handing it over to Daniela. &#34;Ms. Harper, we&#39;ve crossed paths before-at your wedding with Alexander. I&#39;m one of his close friends, Keith Clayton. Just call me Keith.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela might&#39;ve taken the card if he hadn&#39;t brought up Alexander. But when she heard the name, she didn&#39;t bother to take it. &#34;I&#39;m off the clock. I don&#39;t mix business with personal time. If you need something,just talk to my secretary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith&#39;s grin wavered a little, his cheerful act dropping for a second. &#34;It&#39;s not business. I just thought we could be friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian frowned at his words and started to step in, but Daniela held up a hand, stopping her. &#34;I&#39;m no longer married to Alexander. His friends won&#39;t be mine. If there&#39;s nothing else, please excuse me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, she turned and started walking off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she neared her car, Keith saw the concert hall director&#39;s grandson excitedly holding the door open for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the cold indifference she&#39;d shown to both Keith and Alexander, Daniela smiled warmly at the young man.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the glow of the neon lights, the young man&#39;s ears flushed bright red. &#34;Goodbye, Ms. Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith watched with interest as the scene unfolded, his eyes fixed on the young man. He nudged Alexander and said, &#34;You know, Daniela&#39;s always been stunning -guys have always been drawn to her. But now, with her being the CEO of Elite Lux, she&#39;s on an entirely different level. Just look at that boy-he&#39;s all nervous and trying so hard to impress her. And she&#39;s being so sweet with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander walked to the parking lot without saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith continued, &#34;You know, Alexander, if I had realized that Daniela was completely done with you,l wouldn&#39;t have dragged you with me earlier. Do you think I came off badly? I mean, she shut me down pretty quickly back there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Keith kept talking, he caught something odd.Alexander&#39;s hand seemed to hesitate,gripping the car door handle a little tighter, right at the moment he mentioned Daniela being over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith blinked, his instincts kicking in. Alexander was not as unaffected by her as he was trying to make everyone believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith saw his chance and leaned in. &#34;Alexander,women like Daniela are one of a kind, and they deserve to be treated well. She&#39;s beautiful, successful,and getting attention from all sides. If you don&#39;t make a move,someone else will. And Joyce? She&#39;s a ticking time bomb, and her mother isn&#39;t any better. If you go through with marrying her, you&#39;ll regret it every single day. Just think about it-three months ago, Daniela was going out of her way to make you happy. Even now,despite how distant she&#39;s acting, there&#39;s still a bit of warmth in her. If you just let go of your pride and apologize, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll forgive you. So, why keep acting like you couldn&#39;t care less?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face tightened, his frustration obvious. He wrenched the car door open and, before slamming it shut, he snapped, &#34;Does everything havè to be about her now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door banged shut, and his car roared to life,tearing into the night and blending into the rush of traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith stayed behind, watching the taillights disappear. With a deep sigh, he shook his head and muttered under his breath, &#34;If the day ever comes when she really doesn&#39;t love you anymore, you&#39;ll be left begging and pleading.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t hear a thing Keith said. He sped down the road,his mind elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he got home, the living room lights were still on.Richard was there, clearly eager to know how things went with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Alexander could even make it all the way through the door, Richard jumped in with a grin.&#34;Well?How&#39;d it go? I heard that half of Olisvine&#39;s bachelors were at the concert hall tonight. You had a prime spot.Did Daniela notice you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did,&#34; Alexander replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face brightened with hope. Grinning like the result was already decided, he asked, &#34;And? Did you actually talk to her? Did you bring up the idea of getting back together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s smile dropped, frowning.&#34;Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t want to get into it. &#34;I&#39;m tired,&#34;he said sharply, then turned and went upstairs, ending the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was in his room, he didn&#39;t rush to shower or change. He loosened his tie and dropped into a chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, dark and unfocused, stared at the empty room as his mind spiraled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand the feeling that the world was trying to force him and Daniela back together. The thought of chasing someone who didn&#39;t care for him was something he hated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love had always seemed like a concept he didn&#39;t buy into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ten years, Daniela had pursued him-ten years of relentless loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been such a constant part of his life that her sudden absence now left a noticeable void. He tried to convince himself that this unease was simply the result of withdrawal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept repeating the same reasoning in his mind.Their marriage had never been anything but a practical,business-driven arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t been about feelings or love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When things clicked, they stayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they didn&#39;t, they went their separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as simple as that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite all his attempts to rationalize it,Alexander couldn&#39;t shake the image of Cedric standing in front of Daniela earlier that evening. The memory stirred something strange and unsettling inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He repeated in his mind-this was just withdrawal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he kept a dog for years, it was only natural to get attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Daniela was human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander told himself that he was just not used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had gotten home from the concert, only to end up drinking a pricey bottle of wine with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian spent the night ranting about Alexander.When Daniela finally woke up, her head was cloudy, and the events from the night before felt distant and hazy.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a gentle knock echoed at the door.The housekeeper&#39;s unsure voice came through. &#34;Ms.Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Daniela mumbled, still half-dazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper paused for a moment, clearly unsure,before speaking in a hesitant, nervous tone. &#34;There&#39;s a man downstairs, claiming to be your father. He&#39;s been waiting for over an hour. He&#39;s with two women -one named Katrina and the other Joyce. They said they&#39;re your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, the words slowly sinking in. Her gaze turned to the phone on her nightstand, now lighting up with an incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered the phone, put it on speaker, and walked into the bathroom to freshen up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Awake?&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice came through, low and smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm,&#34; Daniela murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had some top-tier food brought in today. Care to join me for lunch?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela patted her face dry with a towel before responding, &#34;Not today. I&#39;ve got something to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set the towel down and clipped her earrings on. Her tone remained calm and light as she said,&#34;Looks like it&#39;s time to confront my family.&#34;</p>
