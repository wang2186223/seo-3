                <p>As the words left his mouth, Cedric immediately wished he could take them back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite what Daniela might feel, he had never planned to bring up Alexander in her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The regret gnawed at him, fueled by his irritation at not having secured the title of Daniela&#39;s boyfriend sooner-instead, he lingered as just another hopeful contender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, after all, wasn&#39;t short of admirers; lacking the official status of her boyfriend, how could he possibly shield her from the wave of persistent suitors?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frustration knew no bounds, yet the words, once uttered, were irrevocable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his grip a bit as he turned to look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered him a smile. She was quite occupied today; an issue had cropped up in the Al development project she was overseeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;Are you tied up? If so, I&#39;ll leave you be:&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting aside the documents she was reviewing, Daniela looked up at the person poised to exit the office.&#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick look back, Cedric remarked, &#34;I&#39;ll go see how the orchard is doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a keen eye on the quality of his produce, Cedric had taken to leasing an orchard on the city&#39;s outskirts,making daily personal inspections a part of his routine. His attention to detail was meticulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to respond, the office door burst open, and Alexander made his entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, wearing a look of regret, addressed Daniela. &#34;Sorry, Daniela. I failed to hold him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander lingered at the doorway, his eyes locked on the vanishing smile that once graced Daniela&#39;s lips.It disappeared, leaving a void that pulled his spirits down withit. He cleared his throat, his voice a mix of hope and hesitation. &#34;Daniela, can we talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett, the world does not orbit around your family&#39;s whims. We all have our own burdens to bear.Next time, consider scheduling an appointment.&#34; Daniela was clearly not in the mood to entertain interruptions, especially with her work piling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s hands balled into fists at his sides, his knuckles whitening. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I was thoughtless.Please accept my apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his earnest apology, Daniela remained unmoved, her expression stoic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had been observing quietly, turned to look at Alexander with raised eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was taken aback by Alexander&#39;s apology. Something was amiss-Alexander must be driven by some ulterior motive today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze sharpened, skepticism coloring his watchful eyes as he scrutinized Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing with the poise of a true gentleman, Alexander persisted. &#34;Then, may I schedule a meeting for this evening? How about Midnight Bar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion seemed out of place-more suited for clandestine romances than serious discussions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric opened his mouth to object, but Daniela interjected, &#34;I am neither your friend nor interested in any personal entanglements. Meeting at a bar is wholly inappropriate.&#34; She glanced at her watch. &#34;You have five minutes.I have another meeting shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander cast a glance at Cedric, his eyes silently pleading for him to take his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cedric seemed.oblivious to the subtle cue, continuing his task of watering the plant without interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office was hardly the ideal setting for personal discussions, and Alexander had planned a meaningful conversation with Daniela for today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure was mounting from Joyce to finalize the engagement ceremony details, and Alexander felt the urgency to clear the air before the day ended. &#34;No worries, take your time,&#34; Alexander responded, his tone soft and accommodating-a stark contrast to his usually assertive manner. &#34;I&#39;Il wait for you. If the bar isn&#39;t a good spot, l&#39;ve also booked a table at a lovely restaurant for lunch. We could go there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His preparation was evident, and without waiting for Daniela&#39;s consent, he offered a polite bow and exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian,who had just walked in, watched Alexander&#39;s smooth exit in surprise and turned to Daniela, curiosity piqued.&#34;Is he trying to mend things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bowed her head, her expression unreadable. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging the response, Lillian simply nodded and retreated to her game, leaving the room to return to its usual quietude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela wrapped up her data work, Cedric&#39;s plant wvas dangerously close to being overwatered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, she approached, relieving him of the watering can with a graceful gesture, &#34;Everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced upward, his eyes meeting Daniela&#39;s. &#34;Are you going to lunch with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod in affirmation. Just as Cedric&#39;s gaze began to drop, laden with disappointment,she went on. &#34;Katrina is not the type to just sit around; she won&#39;t keep Joyce waiting much longer.Alexander&#39;s invitation is merely a desperate attempt to influence my decision, hoping I&#39;ll repeat past mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was taken aback by Daniela&#39;s pragmatic tone. &#34;And you&#39;re still planning to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Otherwise, it would only lead to more complications. Once he realizes it&#39;s futile, I&#39;ll finally be free.Moreover, if I don&#39;t clarify things, it might just spark a hint of jealousy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her mention of jealousy, Cedric involuntarily coughed, his fingers brushing against the watering can Daniela had just put down. &#34;Who would be jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the redness creeping up Cedric&#39;s ears, Daniela let out a gentle laugh. She then reassured him,&#34;Lunch might not fill me up. I&#39;ll cook for you once I&#39;m home.&#34; Cedric felt a wave of relief wash over him. &#34;Do you show this kind of consideration to all your suitors?&#34; he asked, a note of hope in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to answer when Lillian burst into the room, waving her phone energetically.&#34;Daniela, it&#39;s time for the meeting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela had hurried off, Cedric was left alone, pondering whether Daniela extended this kindness to all her suitors or if it was something reserved just for him.</p>
