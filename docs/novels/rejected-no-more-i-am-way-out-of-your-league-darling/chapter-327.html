                <p>The room was filled with the sound of their heavy breaths, growing more frantic with each passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the climax, Cedric stopped suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, confused and flushed, and whispered, &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked at Daniela lying beneath him. She looked like an angel. Her long hair spread out like a waterfall, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you hiding something from me?&#34; Cedric asked,each word sharp as he moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fought back tears from the physical strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered his questions, none too important, but  always dodged the ones that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stared at her, who was biting her lip, and felt his resolve beginto crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, he decided to shift the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the night stretched on, Cedric wrapped his arms around Daniela, the weight of sleep tugging at him.Before drifting off, he whispered near her ear,&#34;You know what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;ve already made myself clear. Your safety always comes first. You&#39;re playing with fire, and the thought of it, the worry it brings me,it cuts deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as Cedric made his way to work, his secretary burst in with enthusiasm, saying,&#34;You won&#39;t believe it! The world&#39;s largest airline wants to form a partnership with us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offer was something they&#39;d dreamed of for years but had been out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group had tried time and again, but obstacles had always stood in their way. Now, the opportunity had come to them, and there was no denying the excitement it stirred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary could hardly contain his excitement,almost giddy with the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The airline&#39;s reputation was unmatched worldwide,with dominance in the industry that was nearly unmatched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Phillips Group secured the partnership, they could rest easy for decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serene smile, Cedric remained unfazed. The secretary grinned and said, &#34;Congratulations!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes flicked over his phone, his expression a mask of indifference. &#34;And what did they have to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much, but they did emphasize how much they admire Phillips Group&#39;s reputation. If we&#39;re on board,they want to seal the deal within a month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric paused, his thumb stilling on the screen. &#34;A month?&#34; &#34;Yeah. That&#39;s what they said. I was a bit taken aback by the timeline, but they insist their company moves quickly and decisively.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, confused by Cedric&#39;s lack of enthusiasm, couldn&#39;t help but wonder why he wasn&#39;t more excited. After all, this was a major opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Cedric gave a directive, saying,&#34;I want a full report on this company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary blinked, taken off guard. &#34;A multinational company like that? You really think we need to investigate them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the company&#39;s size and global reach, it would take considerable time and effort to dig through their layers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught the slight hesitation in his secretary&#39;s expression and said, &#34;Look into any connections with Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded, now clear on the direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric never liked to lean on others for business advantages. He wasn&#39;t interested in pursuing deals linked to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that understanding, the secretary quickly began his investigation. Half an hour later, he returned with an update. &#34;This company has no connection to Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze turned sharp, his curiosity piqued.&#34;And what about Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s confusion grew as he replied, &#34;No connection there either.&#34; He couldn&#39;t understand the shift in Cedric&#39;s focus. Had Cedric been reading too many gossip-filled online novels about him and Daniela? What else could explain such a bold assumption?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary knew Elite Lux had a stake in aviation,but it was a side project, not their primary business-a detail Cedric had already long understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thoughtful pause, the secretary asked, &#34;Are you suspecting something here?&#34; &#34;Not exactly,&#34; Cedric replied dismissively as he picked up his phone, opening one of those serialized novels about him and Daniela. &#34;Inform them we&#39;re not moving forward with this partnershipo for the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s phone hit the floor with a sharp clatter. His jaw dropped, wide enough for a fly to swoop in. &#34;What?&#34; It took several seconds before he could form words. &#34;Sorry, but could you repeat that?I didn&#39;t quite catch it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he heard it loud and clear but couldn&#39;t bring himself to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why in the world would Cedric let such an opportunity slip through his fingers?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied Cedric&#39;s unruffled face and then his eyes,which remained glued to the phone. It dawned on the secretary that Cedric&#39;s obsession with online distractions might be getting out of hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he delivered pastries to Daniela, the secretary couldn&#39;t help but vent, saying, &#34;Cedric hasn&#39;t been able to look away from his phone for days. He even turned down a massive deal because of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Lillian already knew about Phillips Group&#39;s decision to decline the partnership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hint of concern, Daniela asked, &#34;Is he really addicted to the internet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t realized Cedric had developed such a habit at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; the secretary complained, remembering the huge business opportunity. The whole company was gearing up, with some departments already preparing data, only for Cedric to dismiss the collaboration. &#34;The entire Phillips Group is in chaos.Everyone&#39;s talking, wondering why the CEO would reject such a significant deal. Is there something changing within the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he walked away, the secretary turned back with one last plea to Daniela. &#34;Please, talk to him. Convince him not to let distractions derail his focus.I&#39;ve already reached out to the airline company and asked them to hold off, hoping there&#39;s still a chance.Cedric listens to you. Help us bring him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face held an expression of sincere sorrow as if the weight of the loss crushed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary&#39;s connection with Daniela went back years; they had been classmates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shift in their tone made the conversation feel more genuine and relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evident that his concern was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Cedric arrived to pick up Daniela from work. After a series of unforeseen events,they finally made their way back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they stepped inside, Daniela said, &#34;I heard you&#39;ve been pretty wrapped up in the online world lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she spoke, Cedric&#39;s head snapped up.&#34;What did you say?&#34; &#34;Why are you turning down the offer from Dreamfly Airlines?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did my secretary tell you about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric. &#34;He didn&#39;t say what you&#39;re so focused on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Daniela noticed Cedric&#39;s neck turning red.</p>
