                <p>The domestic supply chains of Elite Lux were cut off as soon as the war started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every source for raw materials was completely blocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even basic necessities could be purchased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Members of the commerce association relaxed in the meeting room, their faces lit up with gratification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey said, &#34;Now that we&#39;ve all made our moves, let&#39;s see how long Daniela can maintain her pride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno interjected, &#34;Honestly, we should have done this to Daniela much earlier. Who does she think she is?The world&#39;s wealthiest person? Last year, my family invited her to a banquet, and she didn&#39;t even show up.Such arrogance! Clearly, her family never taught her manners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley laughed and said, &#34;Buno, is it really such a big issue? She skipped your family event, so what? It&#39;s well-known you just wanted to set her up with your son. She figured it out but kept quiet about it. Now,you&#39;re holding a grudge. How long has it been?&#34; &#34;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves. Daniela didn&#39;t reach her position by accident. We must be careful not to become a joke ourselves,&#34; Hackett said, smiling briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey casually brushed at his leg. &#34;Hackett, you excel in many areas, but sometimes you&#39;re too cautious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley agreed. &#34;Right, no matter how skilled Daniela is,she&#39;s still just in her twenties. With no one supporting her,what can she really accomplish alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just watch. In less than three days, Daniela will be coming to us, asking for forgiveness,&#34; Bruno said with a hearty laugh, his plump cheeks bouncing. &#34;The image of her,looking just like Brylee, bowing down to me,delights me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group erupted in laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett allowed himself a moment of ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Bruno was leaving, he clapped Hackett on the back.&#34;Just excel in your role, Hackett. The best is yet to come for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the following days, a nationwide price war disrupted the market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association&#39;s members went from being relaxed to anxious, meeting first daily, then hourly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find a solution!&#34; Bruno shouted, clearly agitated.  &#34;We&#39;re in chaos here, and I hear Daniela is just playing games in her office!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley&#39;s expression grew even more concerned.&#34;We&#39;re all in the same business community. How can Daniela be so harsh with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno clenched his fists. &#34;You all mocked me for wanting Daniela as my daughter-in-law. Now you see her capability, right? This morning, my company&#39;s stocks fell again. The shareholders are glaring at me like they want my head!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Winslow, who was typically quiet, frowned with concern. &#34;The real issue is figuring out how to stop the losses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they instigated the war, they overlooked a critical detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They severed Elite Lux&#39;s supply lines, yet Elite Lux dealt in luxury goods. Their customers cared solely about product quality, not the supplier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furthermore, Elite Lux, globally recognized,constituted only a small portion of Daniela&#39;s broader portfolio.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Severing her domestic supply lines was insignificant.She had numerous flights daily bringing in supplies from overseas, ensuring uninterrupted production. While costs rose slightly, they gained enhanced control over product quality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s business empire extended across multiple sectors including luxury goods, entertainment,education, construction, port transportation, and even aerospace. These varied resources supported Daniela&#39;s operations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commercial conflict not only demonstrated Daniela&#39;s robustness but also highlighted their own weaknesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It exposed their motivations driven by greed to the public eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were fated to lose this battle from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just about losing anymore; what mattered now was finding a way to stop the losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should the losses persist, the association members risked not only their own downfall but also the survival of their enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s self-reliance was evident in her ability to operate independently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered the few remaining smaller items from local businesses, giving them a boost. The owners of these small businesses, eager to earn Daniela&#39;s approval, worked with greater enthusiasm and efficiency compared to the veterans from large corporations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This conflict irrevocably cut off their prospects for future partnerships with any of Daniela&#39;s companies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As everything crumbled, they were left in awe,realizing that the title of the world&#39;s richest person was truly earned. They had definitely overreached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on their earlier criticisms, they now felt as though they were metaphorically hitting themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The repercussions were painfully clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the association, desperation set in as members scrambled to address their mistakes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hackett, this was a flawed decision. You need to be accountable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We joined the association thinking it would offer business insights and financial gains. Now, we&#39;ve ended up with nothing. We&#39;ve even lost contracts from Daniela&#39;s companies-those were major contracts!What&#39;s your plan now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the business world, the bottom line is to make money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had eagerly joined the association, which had yielded no profits, and now they faced substantial financial losses. Just the thought was infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to leave the association! Reimburse me for my losses and return the ten million I paid for the annual membership!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Return our money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return our money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Return our money!&#34;</p>
