                <p>Joyce&#39;s confident stance faltered the moment Daniela&#39;s piercing gaze fixed on the finger she had raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a faint, knowing smirk before lowering her head, resuming her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the police finally arrived,representatives from both Phillips Group and Elite Lux had already shown up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, lacking the wit to keep up, found herself tangled in the barrage of legal arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Daniela&#39;s words were clear and precise. &#34;It was an unfortunate accident. I&#39;m more than willing to make amends and settle this fairly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood stunned, watching Daniela effortlessly play the same pity game Katrina often used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela told the police, &#34;My stepmother has always harbored resentment towards me. After my mother passed, she convinced my father to sever our relationship. She married him just days after my mother&#39;s death. Now that my father is critically ill,she&#39;s barred me from visiting him. Naturally, I became  emotional...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This strategy quickly made the legal complications fade away, and the matter was resolved swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling,Joyce watched as Daniela transferred $20,000 into the hospital account. Then with a sweet smile,Daniela addressed Katrina, who was pale from the pain of her fractured finger. &#34;This money is for you. Get some medicine and take better care of that brain of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina tried to respond, but before she could utter a word, Daniela&#39;s voice grew colder. &#34;Oh, and just so you know, I&#39;ve been feeling a bit homesick lately. I&#39;ll be moving back tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression changed drastically at her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce scowled, her voice laced with indignation.&#34;What right do you think you have? Dad already severed ties with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even think? If not, you might want to consider getting yourself a brain.&#34; Daniela leaned back,completely at ease. &#34;Yes, Caiden cut ties with me.But the villa was my mother&#39;s. Under inheritance law, I still have a stake in it. I can move back whenever I choose,and not even Caiden can stop me-certainly not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood, stretching lazily, her eyes sweeping over Katrina and Joyce with clear contempt.&#34;You two  should probably start praying that Caiden doesn&#39;t die anytime soon. Otherwise, the portion of the villa left to you might be smaller than a bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed like a heavy blow. Katrina&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. The doctor, misreading her response, murmured, &#34;I&#39;ll be more gentle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face remained torn, her mind swirling with confusion. Then, Daniela added the final blow. &#34;I&#39;ll be on my way now. I have a feeling Caiden will wake soon. Don&#39;t you think so,Katrina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was stunned into silence, her thoughts scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stormed over to Alexander, slipping her arm through his with a sense of urgency. &#34;Alexander! Did you hear the way Daniela was talking? So sarcastic,so cold! Anyone who heard her would think we were the ones who killed Brylee! It&#39;s a blessing you didn&#39;t stay with her; she&#39;s totally out of her mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasn&#39;t so easily fooled. Joyce might have missed the meaning of Daniela&#39;s words, but he didn&#39;t.What did she mean by Caiden waking up soon? How could she possibly know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander narrowed his eyes, a growing suspicion forming as his gaze turned to Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina,getting ready for surgery on her  fractured finger,stepped out of the ward to make a call before signing the necessary forms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the quiet hospital garden, she whispered into the phone, &#34;Mom, do you think Daniela has figured something out? Why would she suddenly want to move back? She has a prime spot in the Elite Lux building with a city view. Why would she want to move back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, her mother was playing cards.&#34;You&#39;re overthinking it. Daniela was just a kid back then. She was only five. Who remembers things from that age?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s unease persisted. &#34;Then why did she snap so suddenly? She&#39;s always been so calm, never argumentative. But today, she was completely different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother let out a soft laugh. &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because of Alexander. She&#39;s probably just holding a grudge.Think about it-she loved him for so long. What&#39;s the term? Oh,right, sunk cost. Alexander&#39;s her sunk cost.She&#39;s upset she lost him and can&#39;t do anything about it,so now she&#39;s taking it out on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina muttered quietly, &#34;Is that really what it is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something didn&#39;t sitright. Daniela didn&#39;t appear bitter. In fact, she seemed to have grown quite close to Cedric. She had even entrusted him with the sales of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t that imply Cedric was now more significant to Daniela than Alexander?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Katrina boil with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had lost Alexander but gained someone even more valuable-Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she have such luck?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric had chosen Joyce, it would&#39;ve been perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother&#39;s voice snapped her out of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, I&#39;m out of money again. Send me half a million. And stop worrying about Daniela. Brylee was tough back then, but she couldn&#39;t outdo you in the end,right? You&#39;ve done fine since then. If you handled Brylee,Daniela will be a breeze. And if things go south,just take care of her too. Problem solved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina ended the call, but her mind was still swirling with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs,Joyce summoned her for surgery, and Katrina made her way back to the surgical ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Daniela figured something out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was her real reason for coming back this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, she missed a step and tumbled down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a sharp crack, and her whole hand snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her piercing scream rang out, reaching the underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the parking lot, Cedric stopped Daniela just as she was about to enter her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up at him, asking, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
