                <p>Daniela led Carol away to get changed, and once they emerged,she immediately set out to find Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric seemed restless all evening, and the thought of him squaring off against the cunning Hamilton alone didn&#39;t sit right with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d barely stepped into the hallway when she ran into Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blocked her path with a practiced,casual smile.&#34;Cedric asked me to let you know he&#39;s gone up to the study with Mr. McCoy. Mr. McCoy sent me to fetch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a skeptical brow. &#34;Cedric sent you to find me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric kept a personal blacklist, Alexander&#39;s name would be etched in at number one. There was no way Cedric would willingly involve Alexander in anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander just shrugged, trying to appear nonchalant.&#34;Why would I make this up? If you&#39;re that suspicious,go ahead-call Cedric yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unconvinced, Daniela immediately dialed Cedric&#39;s number</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went straight to voicemail-his phone was off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gestured toward the staircase. &#34;Are you coming or not? The study&#39;s waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tucked her phone away and squared her shoulders. &#34;Which floor did you say? I&#39;ll go up myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a brisk nod. &#34;Eighth floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Daniela strode toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pressing the button for the eighth floor, she realized that this villa only had eight floors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed the button for a random floor and stepped out, finding a staff member to ask,&#39;-′′|Hamilton&#39;s studyon the eighth floor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. If you see anyone of my companions,tell them I&#39;m headed up. And if you spot Nikolas or Damon,let them know too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick nod of thanks, she stepped back into the elevator and rode it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator ascended slowly. When the doors opened, she stepped onto an expansive terrace-wide open, with the night air swirling in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned. Before she could react, someone pushed her from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinct took over; Daniela staggered forward,caught herself on the terrace railing, and spun around,eyes blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stood behind her, blocking the exit-far too composed for someone who&#39;d supposedly been busy elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not surprised, huh?&#34; he asked, studying her unflinching gaze. &#34;Honestly, I thought you&#39;d be frightened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steadier, sharper energy radiated from him now.It seemed that he was clutching some secret advantage,something that braced his spine and made him bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, you&#39;re beyond shameless. What&#39;s this little act for? Trying to lure me up here-what are you really after?&#34; Daniela&#39;s mind churned with anxiety over Cedric, afraid he might be no match for whatever traps waited downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s smile curved, his gaze lingering on Daniela&#39;s flawless features as if he couldn&#39;t tear his gaze away. &#34;Daniela, you know how I&#39;ve always felt for you. Back when I thought you were gone for good,everything lost its color. But then you came back, and suddenly,life made sense</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He locked his eyes on hers, voice trembling with a quiet intensity. &#39;&#34;You have no idea how much I missed you. I&#39;ve never loved anyone else like this-not even close.Daniela, I love you. I really, truly love you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained motionless, her face as unreadable as stone. &#34;If you&#39;ve finished, I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a brisk turn, she started for the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander stepped in her way, blocking her exit.Sadness crept over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you in such a rush to leave? You&#39;re right here,Daniela.&#34; He put his hand on his chest. &#34;Every night, I dream about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disgust rippled through her; her eyes narrowed in disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slapped his hand away, her voice sharper than before. &#34;You think you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s ever wanted me? Get over yourself, Alexander. Now get lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s hand hovered in midair, stung by Daniela&#39;s icy dismissal. His features crumpled with aching regret &#34;Daniela, are you never going to give me another chance? We were married, remember? Can&#39;t we just go back-pretend the divorce never happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a glare, her words cutting through the tension &#34;Keep dreaming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow sigh escaped him, shoulders sagging in defeat. &#34;I never wanted to force you. I love you too much for that. But you&#39;ve always refused to listen to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Alexander pulled a knife from his pocket, the blade catching the overhead light witha sinister glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced him without flinching, her eyes unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A manic, broken laugh tore from Alexander&#39;s throat.&#34;They say you&#39;re some mercenary legend. I know my little stunts mean nothing to you. Did you get the text earlier? Hamilton&#39;s been digging for your weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Alexander dragged the blade across his wrist in one swift, reckless motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scarlet droplets hit the floor in a steady, chilling rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One splash spattered across Daniela&#39;s cheek-startling,cold,and slick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Daniela froze. Her eyes fixed on the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blood, her muscles locked in place, a sudden, primal unease thrumming through her veins. She curled her hands into fists, knuckles whitening as she fought to keep her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s been hounding me to give up your weaknesses,&#34; Alexander gasped, his voice ragged,thick with pain and desperation. &#34;But I wouldn&#39;t tell him.I couldn&#39;t do that to you, Daniela. Don&#39;t you get it?&#34;</p>
