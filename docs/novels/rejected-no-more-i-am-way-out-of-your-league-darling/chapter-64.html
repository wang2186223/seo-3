                <p>Caiden received the documents, his expression unreadable as he took hold of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thumbed through the documents. Daniela&#39;s request was simple: she sought to cut all ties with the Harper family.Beyond that, she demanded nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t exactly a shock. Considering the robust financial status of Elite Lux, Daniela likely had little interest in the modest assets of Harper Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Caiden fell into a brief silence. He looked at Daniela, then at the lobby around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Signing the documents meant severing every link to Daniela for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his twilight years, as life faded away, Daniela would bear no obligation towards him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the correct path to choose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s thoughts churned silently. No matter Daniela&#39;s achievements, she was not her flesh and blood.Introducing her own daughter to the ranks of Elite Lux seemed the more crucial strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina faced Daniela, her eyes narrowed with suspicion, and declared, &#34;We&#39;ll sign, but mark my words. If you fire Joyce right after, don&#39;t expect to get away unscathed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with unruffled serenity, &#34;Joyce is welcome to remain at Elite Lux as long as she wishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Katrina at these words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Caiden, she spoke with unwavering certainty. &#34;This deal is absolutely worth every bit of it! Or are you still under the illusion that Daniela will look after you in your old age? Just look at her-she&#39;s eager to sever all ties! Do you genuinely believe she still regards you as a father? Consider the cunning it takes to ascend to CEO of Elite Lux. Do you honestly think she&#39;s a straightforward person? Stick with her if you want,but as soon as Elite Lux solidifies, she&#39;ll focus all her energy on tearing you apart. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. This deal represents the best scenario for us! Joyce is far too naive right now. Daniela should step in and provide the mentorship she needs to grow. When it&#39;s timne, Joyce will return to Harper Group and propel it to new heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shot a&#39;meaningful look at Cedric, then continued, &#34;There&#39;s no denying that Joyce has a crush on Cedric. Given the Harper family&#39;s prestige, she wouldn&#39;t stand a chance to even meet someone of his caliber. Yet, by staying close to Daniela, she&#39;s around him daily. Consider this-hasn&#39;t Alexander already shown a preference for our daughter? Once Cedric truly sees what Daniela is like, he&#39;ll inevitably be drawn to Joyce, just as Alexander was. When that happens, imagine Cedric as your son-in-law. What concerns could you possibly have as you grow older?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were meticulously chosen, each one striking precisely where intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden cast a glance towards Daniela, his face unreadable for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, for her part, remained poised, her expression serene yet detached. In that moment, it dawned on Caiden that Katrina&#39;s insights were spot-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, with her aloof and steadfast demeanor, could not be depended upon in the way they needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; he declared, his tone decisive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyelids fluttered closed momentarily, concealing whatever emotions might have surfaced.She then observed as Caiden extracted a pen from his suit pocket and leaned forward to inscribe his name meticulously on the documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he concluded his remarks, Caiden straightened his posture and gazed into her eyes. &#34;Honestly, Daniela,you ought to have grasped these truths by yourself. Yet, since the bond of father and daughter no longer binds us, allow me to offer you some final guidance. A woman should not be overly assertive. The ideal role for a woman is to remain at home, supporting her husband and nurturing her children. You were on the right track when you pursued Alexander-submissive, gentle, and aware of your role. However, you failed to keep him, didn&#39;t you? That fault lies with you. You should ponder on where you went astray. As a daughter, you&#39;re a complete disappointment. What good are all your fancy degrees and titles if you can&#39;t even manage basic decency or a shred of kindness? You&#39;ve consistently failed to endear yourself to others, and that is your most profound failure. When Joyce enters your company, observe carefully how she conducts herself. In this matter, you should emulate her-she surpasses you in every conceivable way. And let me reiterate, from this point forward, your fate is no longer linked to the Harper family. You&#39;re entirely on your own. Should you ever marry, do not seek us out-you&#39;ll have no familial support to rely on. These documents, this severance -you pushed for it. Thus, do not return in tears seeking reconciliation. And regarding the Harper family&#39;s wealth-your mother and I accumulated it together. You are correct in one regard: you have no right to it.Thankfully, you had the sense to recognize this. From here on out, you are on your own. That is all I wish to impart to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden spoke, his eyes were icy and detached, reflecting nothing but self-serving intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood motionless, absorbing the scene unfolding before her. Every word uttered, every gesture made, was indelibly imprinted in her mind, stark and inescapable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes brimmed with tears, yet she staunchly held them back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile flickered across her lips as she finally addressed Caiden. &#34;Well then, I appreciate your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had anticipated a moment of hesitation from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hoped he might deliberate a bit longer, given Elite Lux&#39;s staggering achievements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was not to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, regardless of her accomplishments, she remained dispensable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gathered the folds of her flowing gown and bowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her head, she gazed up at Caiden-mirroring the way she once looked up to him as a child, filled with awe and longing. Now, however, her eyes were stripped of that naivety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, she declared, &#34;Henceforth, be it in life or death, in joy or in grief, I am no longer of your concern.&#34;</p>
