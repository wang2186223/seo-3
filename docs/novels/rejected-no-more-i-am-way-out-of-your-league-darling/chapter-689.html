                <p>Daniela arrived home to find Joyce and Jack basking in the beauty of the blossoms in the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jack spotted Daniela, Joyce gave him a subtle nudge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack stood with a grin and hurried over to Daniela.&#34;Auntie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nod, her eyes drifting toward Joyce in the distance, who greeted her with a slightly uncomfortable smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Auntie, I was admiring the flowers. I went to school today,&#34; Jack added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce walked over to Daniela. &#34;I took Jack to his old school today, and I helped Tasha with the housework.From now on, I&#39;ll handle the garden and the flowers.&#34; It was unusual for Joyce to show such warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pulled Jack closer and smiled at Daniela.&#34;Daniela, I know we&#39;re not blood relatives, and we&#39;ve had our misunderstandings. But seeing how much Jack cares for you, please let us stay. I promise, all I want is for him to grow up in a peaceful environment.I have no other motives!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, Joyce lowered herself in a bow with Jack by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce wasn&#39;t naive; she knew how to read the situation. She understood that without Daniela&#39;s support, she and Jack would be powerless in the eyes of others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only by staying close to Daniela could Jack secure a bright future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, while going through old things today, I found a USB drive my mother had secretly placed in my bag before she died. It contains a recording with clues about your mother&#39;s murder. I&#39;m giving it to you now,hoping you&#39;ll consider this and help us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pulled the USB drive from her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she felt a deep sense of gratitude toward Katrina, for this USB drive could be the key to securing her and Jack&#39;s safety for a lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent for a few moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela extended her hand and took the USB drive.&#34;Of all the strategies your mother set in place for your future, giving you this USB drive was a smart move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a sigh of relief, relieved that Daniela had agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela made her way toward the villa, the USB drive held firmly in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Joyce and Jack stood up. Joyce knelt down and gestured toward Daniela&#39;s retreating form.&#34;Sweetheart, remember what I told you. You must listen to Daniela for the rest of your life, follow her,and always be respectful to her. She&#39;ll make sure you grow up safe and sound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack looked at Joyce, confused. &#34;What about you,Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stared at the flowers in the distance, her voice softening and turning colder. &#34;I have my own vengeance to settle. If I succeed, I can reclaim the Sinclair family&#39;s wealth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jack would then live a lifeof prosperity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she failed...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced down at the plump boy standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though Daniela and I aren&#39;t related by blood,we grew up together. She&#39;s kind-hearted and won&#39;t turn her back on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had thought about using the USB drive to have Daniela help her retrieve the Sinclair family&#39;s assets stolen by Alexander, but in the end, she chose not to. Instead, she used the USB drive to build a posiive relationship for her child, ensuring Jack&#39;s bright future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the best plan a mother could devise for her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mother had made plans for her in the past, and now it wvas her turn to plan for her son&#39;s future.</p>
