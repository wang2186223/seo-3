                <p>Lillian whispered to the assembled group,&#34;Get some rest. When Daniela is up, we&#39;ll haveplenty to tackle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, she and Ryan closed their eyes,surrendering to slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The members of Phillips Group watched in silent amazement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people from Elite Lux was so composed-hardly a surprise given Daniela&#39;s status as the wealthiest in the world. Her calm was legendary, truly a sight to behold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to succumb to sleep themselves, yet unsure of their next steps, they merely exchanged bewildered glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric found himself in a precarious position;with Phillips Group&#39;s official website compromised by hackers, no public statements could be made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the fervent keystrokes of frantic technicians,the digital breach remained unmitigated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had initially planned to hold apress conference,but Daniela had told him it wasn&#39;t necessary before she went to sleep, so he had no choice but to sit tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idle and restless, he wandered into the kitchen to slice some fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows, the PR department manager observed Cedric&#39;s relaxed figure and murmured to the tech team, &#34;Has Mr. Phillips resigned himself to this fate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What other options does he have? The evidence against him is overwhelmingly incriminating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could Phillips Group really collapse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s uncertain, but with Ms. Harper&#39;s presence, it&#39;s unlikely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve just invested in a house. If the company folds, I&#39;ll be ruined. Do you think Elite Lux has any openings? I&#39;d seriously consider a position there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could I possibly join as well? I&#39;d take any job at Elite Lux; I&#39;m not concerned about the salary. I just want to be near someone I&#39;ve admired so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mutual understanding passed between the PR manager and the tech staff with a series of knowing nods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, overhearing the conversation from a short distance,interjected with a hint of amusement, &#34;Hey,the company hasn&#39;t sunk just yet.&#34; They all turned to Cedric, their laughter tinged with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,peeling an orange, let the silence hang briefly before adding, &#34;If it really comes to it, I might also seek out a role at Elite Lux. I wonder if my wife would consider hiring me as her personal assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager and the tech team were utterly dumbstruck. After such a lurid scandal, how could he even dream of becoming her personal assistant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The PR manager eyed Daniela warily before turning to Cedric,his voice barely above a whisper. &#34;Isn&#39;t your wife upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tech staff added, &#34;The clarity of that footage was startling.Surely,she must be livid after viewing it, no?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crafty smirkcurled Cedric&#39;s lips as he leaned in, a twinkle of mischief in his eye. &#34;Oh, she&#39;s well aware that the man in that video isn&#39;t me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even wanted to boast about his performance in bed. &#34;I&#39;d do a far better job than the guy in the video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the day spent with Ryan at the hospital, a solid alibi. Daniela, with her keen eye, would have instantly noted the man in the video wasn&#39;t him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was simply no need for explanations-words were unnecessary. Such was their unspoken, profound  connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric crossed his arms, reclined further into the sofa,and flashed a grin. &#34;Such understanding comes only with the bonds of marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others absorbed Cedric&#39;s unwavering calm, their expressions mingling shock with a touch of envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tech staff asked, &#34;You&#39;re truly not perturbed in the slightest? People online are ruthlessly tearing you apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t grasp it unless you were married,&#34;Cedric responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As everyone mulled over his repeated phrase,Cedric added, &#34;Once you&#39;re married, you&#39;ll understand that even if the entire world turns against you, your partner will always be your steadfast ally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell over the group, a mixture of surprise and slight annoyance at his overt romanticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the strained mood hanging over the Harper family&#39;s villa, the eight members of the commerce association were in high spirits, clinking champagne glasses deep intothe night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno clucked his tongue, a smirk playing on hislips.&#34;The one who knows you best is often the one who strikes the hardest. Alexander&#39;s move was truly cruel,  targeting Cedric right at Daniela&#39;s greatest weakness!Daniela&#39;s definitely too drained to focus on our strategies now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey chimed in, &#34;Exactly. My company&#39;s new game is finally picking up steam!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley sighed, his forehead creasing. &#34;I was petrified,thinking my business was on the brink of collapse!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the discussions, Winslow stood by, his silence heavy,absorbing every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett let out a low chuckle. &#34;Like I&#39;ve always said,despite Daniela&#39;s remarkable skills, she remains merely human. A minor hurdle, and she crumbles!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tripp,nodding along with a knowing smile,responded to Hackett, &#34;This time, even Cedric&#39;s formidable efforts won&#39;t change the outcome. Now that we&#39;ve handled Cedric, what&#39;s our timeline for dealing with Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey quickly joined the conversation, his voice tinged with urgency. &#34;Yes. Hackett, when do we move against Daniela? You have no idea the losses my company has suffered this time. I won&#39;t find peace until Daniela is out of the picture!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus stood up decisively. &#34;It&#39;s time to eliminate Daniela!&#34; The others rose in unison, a wave of agreement sweeping through them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling,Hackett affirmed, &#34;Indeed, it&#39;s settled then; Daniela&#39;s days are numbered. And when we strike,Alexander wvill fall alongside her. If we redirect their business domestically, the profits will more than make up for our recent setbacks-a thousand times over. With Daniela out of the way, the domestic market will finally be within our grasp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the thought of seizing control from the wealthiest in the world, smiles spread contagiously across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we need to approach this game with caution,&#34;Hackett suggested, his eyes glinting with slyness. &#34;It&#39;s too early to provoke Alexander. Let&#39;s use him to corner Daniela instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he strategized, Hackett gestured to his secretary with a grin, instructing them to dispatch yet another priceless antique to the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with laughter and merriment as Hackett invited his so-called daughters to partake in the festivities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander scoffed indifferently at the gift from Hack&lt;ett.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remarked appreciatively, &#34;That&#39;s quite  generous of Hackett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Hackett&#39;s call came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, I owe you one! Your strategy has turned Phillips Group into public enemy number one, but...&#34;Hackett hesitated, his tone turning serious. &#34;How should we deal the final blow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When someone is down, you make sure they don&#39;t get back up, right?&#34; Alexander replied coldly as he stared out at the pine trees dotting the horizon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the phone on speaker, the eight listeners in the room exchanged excited glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, rubbing his bald head with a broad smile,exclaimed, &#34;Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! Cedric won&#39;t have a chance to rise again!&#34;</p>
