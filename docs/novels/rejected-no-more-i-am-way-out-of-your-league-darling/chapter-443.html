                <p>Cedric, ensconced in the office chair Daniela had provided, felt a disquieting sense of something amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Daniela getting dragged into the Dury sisters&#39; drama?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, standing behind Elyse, struck him as a particularly thorny character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric could tell Natalie was someone who knew how to manipulate people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt Cedric&#39;s gaze úpon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, she feigned wiping away invisible tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured all men were the same, always falling for the delicate, innocent type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to that dimwit Nina, she thought, any sane man would choose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie subtly squared her shoulders, turning to give Cedric what she thought was a dazzling, irresistible smile. But the smile froze on her lips the very next second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Cedric&#39;s supposedly sympathetic gaze seem so harsh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Natalie quickly averted her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, she head Elyse speaking to Daniela. &#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t want to make things difficult for you, but Nina is simply beyond the pale. How could she just stand by while her sister was being harassed? Elite Lux can&#39;t harbor someone like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a smile,′′|sthat so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded vigorously. &#34;Absolutely. Nina is utterly ruthless. Forget Elite Lux, even if she wants to join Harper Group, she should apologize to Natalie first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat in her chair and rested her elbows on the table, while Elyse appeared overbearing, determined to get Nina fired. Cedric, frowning, stepped forward to stand protectively behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse,noticing Cedric&#39;s imposing presence, swalowed nervously, her bravado faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must make a choice today,&#34; Elyse demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled faintly, her demeanor cool and detached. &#34;Aunt Elyse, I always thought this was a family matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s furious expression wavered, her momentum clearly waning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie is a top-tier graduate, returning from overseas with experience at prestigious companies. Is she incapable of distinguishing between personal and professional conduct? If evensuch trifling matters require my personal intervention, then I fail to see the purpose of having her as a secretary.&#34; Daniela&#39;s tone dripped with criticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was flustered. &#34;No, that&#39;s not what I meant at all. Natalie is perfectly capable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ignored the interruption, her sharp gaze fixed on Natalie, a subtle smile playing on her lips. &#34;Or perhaps, are you relying on our family connection to act so brazenly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, alarmed, opened her mouth to offer an explanation, but Daniela raised a hand to stop her. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, then I don&#39;t want either Nina or Natalie. Otherwise, the company&#39;s operations will suffer, and I simply don&#39;t have the energy for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to imply that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at Natalie. &#34;Since that wasn&#39;t your intention, I trust you&#39;ll handle your personal affairs with the appropriate discretion, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gritted her teeth, realizing she had been outmaneuvered. Daniela was incredibly skilled, handling the situation with a few well-chosen words, leaving her utterly speechless and defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She managed a grudging &#34;Yes,&#34; the word practically forced through her clenched jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, maintaining her authoritative stance, continued to stare at Natalie. &#34;Furthermore, your relationship with Linden has caused quite a stir within the company, creating a negative impression. While I offer you both my blessings, I sincerely hope that today&#39;s public display of affection in the hallway won&#39;t be repeated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrase &#34;public display of affection&#34; was like a slap in the face for Natalie, mortifying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elyse dragged her out of the CEO&#39;s office, Natalie cast a lingering, complex glance at Cedric, her emotions a tangled mess of resentment, affection,and regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside Daniela&#39;s office, Elyse couldn&#39;t help but marvel. &#34;Daniela is truly something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, concerned about her image in Cedric&#39;s eyes, was seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, why did you involvé me in this if you weren&#39;t sure Daniela would fire Nina? Didn&#39;t you see how much Cedric despises me because of this? You&#39;ve completely ruined everything for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was taken aback by Natalie&#39;s outburst. &#34;What are you talking about? I was standing up fo you,and now you&#39;re blaming me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie retorted, &#34;Who else should I blame? If you hadn&#39;t caused Aunt Brylee&#39;s death, would I have to fight tooth and nail for my inheritance like this? Aunt Brylee promised me the most lavish dowry when I grew up,but your greed for her assets led to her demise. Now, everything is in Daniela&#39;s hands, and she&#39;s so incredibly capable that I get nothing, while being humiliated by someone like Linden. You&#39;ve completely ruined my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stared at Natalie, her mouth agape in disbelief. &#34;Natalie, you can&#39;t talk like this. Who was it that wanted to be the lady of a prominent family, free from others&#39; charity? How can you say this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was heartbroken, the pain of her daughter&#39;s words cutting deep. &#34;You were the one who helped me plan everything back then. Now you&#39;re making it sound like I orchestrated everything alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie dismissed her mother&#39;s words with a wave of her hand. &#34;I was underage then, but you believed everything I said. Mom, don&#39;t you have any judgment of your own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked at her daughter, feeling as if Natalie were a complete stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this woman really her daughter?</p>
