                <p>Alexander struggled to keep his balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry, bitter laugh slipped from his lips. &#34;You&#39;re afraid Cedric might hear me? Do you care about him that much?Daniela, do you remember how much you used to care about me? Do you even remember who I was to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t have the patience for a drawn-out fight. &#34;I&#39;ve moved on. Just go.&#34; She turned around and reached for the car door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander wasn&#39;t done yet. &#34;Just give me one chance, Daniela. That&#39;s allI&#39;m asking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You already had more than enough,&#34; Daniela said, her voice cold and steady. &#34;I never loved you, not really.You know that. I chased after you because I thought you were that boy from my childhood.But were you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes welled with a sudden sting of emotion. &#34;So you figured it out? I had a feeling you would.But even if I wasn&#39;t the one from back then, does that really change everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression tightened. There was no anger-just the weary weight of honesty. &#34;You can&#39;t force love,Alexander.Or hate, for that matter. Some things in life just don&#39;t work the way we want. Let&#39;s not drag this out more than we already have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing rattled Alexander more than the calm finality in her tone. Whenever she spoke like that, it usually meant the door was shut for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really your answer?&#34; Alexander asked, jaw clenched. &#34;Cedric&#39;s lame. He hasn&#39;t beenrunning the Phillips Group. I&#39;m the one in charge now. Are you really choosing to walk away from me for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave no reply. Her silence told him everything he needed to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then,&#34; he said, lowering his gaze. &#34;Just don&#39;t come crawling back when it all falls apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet nod was all Daniela gave him. &#34;Sure. Don&#39;t bother showing up.&#34; She glanced up to the second floor.Cedric&#39;s window was dark. That was enough for her. With a shove, she pushed Alexander out of her way and slipped into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine roared to life, and the car sped down the long driveway, away from the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the wheel, Carol scoffed, &#34;Alexander&#39;s a damn fraud. He already squeezed everything he could out of the McCoy family. Why the act? What&#39;s he pretending to be heartbroken for now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t care about these things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Carol was fuming. &#34;He&#39;s acting like letting go is some kind of noble sacrifice. Like you don&#39;t know his worth. It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her irritation seeped into each word she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes fixed on the open stretch of road ahead, Daniela spoke in an even tone. &#34;We&#39;re being followed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol frowned, her eyes darting to the rearview mirror. &#34;Is he serious right now? Didn&#39;t you already make things clear to him? What more does he want? I swear, l&#39;ve never seen someone so shameless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, Carol slammed on the brakes, flung the door open, and marched straight to the car behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s car rolled to a stop a second later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t waste time. &#34;Enough, Alexander. What the hell do you want now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had no real answer.Following them had been a gut reaction. Now that he was being called out,the words wouldn&#39;t come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You said you love Daniela,remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his gaze slowly, Alexander met Carol&#39;s eyes through the windshield.&#34;|do.&#34; Carol let out a cold, mocking laugh.&#34;Oh, really? Enough to put your life on the line? That&#39;s funny. You sure didn&#39;t look brave when you ran off that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment hit a nerve. Alexander&#39;s expression shifted, clouded by guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still think you&#39;ve got a shot? That she&#39;ll take you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of denying it, Alexander stared at Carol. &#34;Will you help me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his surprise, Carol gave a quick nod. &#34;Sure. But you don&#39;t need to throw yourself off a cliff to doit.You want to prove something? Give back everything the McCoy family ever handed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Alexander&#39;s hands clenched tighter around the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol caught the hesitation on his face and let out a laugh. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Having trouble letting go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s tone became icy, carrying a hint of detachment. &#34;That&#39;s not it. The cooperation with the McCoy family has nothing to do with my relationship with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp tilt of her head, Carol gave him a once-over. &#34;Oh, please. You expect me to buy that? If Cedric or Daniela wasn&#39;t in the picture, the Bennett family wouldn&#39;t even be on the McCoy family&#39;s radar.Alexander,have you no shame at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hit its mark. His mouth pressed into a hard line, and the color drained from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. There&#39;s a connection,&#34; he admitted after a pause. &#34;But I can keep it in check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol tapped her hand&#39;s palm gently against his car&#39;s hood. &#34;Don&#39;t try to dress it up, Alexander.We&#39;re not here for your excuses. You want help? End the deal with the McCoy family. Do that, and I&#39;ll consider giving you a hand with Daniela. Maybe even let you move into her villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts swirled in his head. News headlines flashing praise. Richard&#39;s smug grin. Bennett Group&#39;s stock climbing like never before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t give her an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol saw it all in the way his eyes wavered. &#34;Figures,&#34; she said with a scoff.&#34;You&#39;re just full of it. If Cedric were in your place, he&#39;d already be halfway/to cutting ties. That&#39;s the difference-you hesitate. You cling to safety. That&#39;s why you&#39;ll never win. And honestly? You&#39;re exhausting. Leave Daniela alone if you&#39;ve got even a shred of dignity left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving him another look, Carol turned on her heel and walked away. Sliding back into the driver&#39;s seat, she told Daniela, &#34;Done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No emotion crossed Daniela&#39;s face. &#34;Drive.&#34; Her voice was colder than the night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a curt nod and started the engine. After a few minutes, her eyes flicked up to the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an irritated sigh, Carol clicked her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s patience had run dry. &#34;Get rid of him!&#34;</p>
