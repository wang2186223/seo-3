                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice quavered as he spoke,his words laced with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility that Daniela might remain silent,withhold an explanation, and simply dismiss him was a terrifying prospect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, when Daniela finally broke her silence, Cedric released a deep, audible sigh of relief, grateful that she was at least open to conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cool, detached lift of her eyes, Daniela posed a chilling question. &#34;I&#39;ll ask you one last time-is there something you&#39;re hiding from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s heart skipped a beat, freezing him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, visibly unsettled, quickly took a seat, his smile fading as his anxiety took over. &#34;Daniela, why are you talking like that? Cedric isn&#39;t your boyfriend.Why does he owe you an explanation for everything? Why can&#39;t you mind your own business? He&#39;s merely a guest in our home. Let him be. After all, Cedric is an adult-he should be free to make his own choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, ignoring Caiden&#39;s pleas, maintained her unwavering stare at Cedric. &#34;Is that how you feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric vehemently shook his head, his response immediate. &#34;No, that&#39;s not it at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention away from him, Daniela&#39;s gaze drifted back to the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression was one of calm indifference, but Cedric&#39;s heart hammered against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew well that Daniela was a woman of compassion, yet a single act of betrayal could irreversibly turn her cold, unforgiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, terror seized him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have anything you want to tell me?&#34; Daniela pressed on, her tone unwaveringly composed. &#34;I&#39;m asking for the third time now.&#34; Caiden, too, was shivering with fear. The thought that Cedric might spill the truth was unbearable; it would mean waving goodbye to his 300 million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a catastrophic turn of events!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he ever come to have such a troublesome daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was bound to wreck everything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clamped his mouth shut, his resolve hardening. Daniela rose abruptly, seized his arm with a firm grip, and pulled him outside, slamming the door shut behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lingered by the door, a somber figure lost in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hastily exited the villa and approached Cedric. &#34;First, we&#39;ll head to the bank and grab the money. Once it&#39;s all settled, I&#39;ll help you coax her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he knew no matter what, Daniela wouldn&#39;t budge! Her icy demeanor was impenetrable! His true agenda was to get the funds at all costs. Yet Cedric remained rooted to the spot, unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rain cascaded down in torrents, punctuated by the stark flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Caiden had left the door open, but the wind was fierce. Josie, thinking quickly, handed Cedric an umbrella and closed the door against the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was settled on the living room couch, his eyes glued to Daniela as she engrossed herself in her game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intensity was unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t fathom what Cedric found so appealing about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, a storm unleashed its fury, but Daniela remained indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re that concerned about him, why not join him outside?&#34; Daniela stated in a frigid tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated briefly before resigning himself to the comfort of the sofa, not daring to counter her suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the rain relentlessly pounded against the windows throughout dinner, Caiden grew visibly anxious. He leaned towards Katrina and confessed in a low voice,&#34;You know, Daniela actually intimidates me a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stole a glance at the raging storm outside,then turned her gaze to Daniela. She instinctively pulled her feet back, feeling a twinge of fear towards Daniela as wvell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time midnight rolled around, exhaustion had overtaken everyone, and they made their way upstairs to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian disappeared into her room, she paused by Daniela and remarked, &#34;Cedric is still outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan added, &#34;The rain&#39;s really coming down hard.Shouldn&#39;t we bring him inside and let him leave tomorrow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look up from her game. Her face gave nothing away as she continued to tap at her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the night, the storm raged on, a symphony of relentless rain, brilliant flashes of lightning, and deep rumbles of thunder, only subsiding as dawn approached.</p>
