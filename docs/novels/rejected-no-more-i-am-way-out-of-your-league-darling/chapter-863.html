                <p>&#34;Do you really think it&#39;s not skill i&#39;m mussing right now?&#34;Nikolas had lost count of how many times he d heard that line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment he started carving his own path.countless voices echoed the same judgment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never bought into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lifetime of being stotted into his father&#39;s plans and written off as an afterthought had wormed its way under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was he to believe he could do anything remarkable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d spent years trailing behind his father.clinging to someone else&#39;s vision. never daring to trust his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Cedric pointed out his lack of faith in himself, he wanted to believe Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought startled him. He didn&#39;t know where this hope had come from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never trusted anyone&#39;s words before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet,right now.he desperately wanted them to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand tightened around the edge of the project proposal,his knuckles white. Eyes rimmed red from a night without sleep. he turned to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his gaze, steady and sure. &#34;As your biggest backer. I agree with Cedric. Nikolas, you&#39;re not the person you used to be. This is your moment. Make them pay attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t hesitate as she stated. &#34;Now&#39;s the time they learn to fear you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words crashed through him. sharp as lightning Nikolas drew a shaky breath. &#34;Now&#39;s the time they learn to fear me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he burst from the room, fueled by a sudden,unstoppable resolve</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric settled at the dining table knife and fork in hand.poised to dig in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thunderous crash echoed through the villa as the front door flew open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas burst in, breathless and willd-eyed. He jabbed a finger at the three diners, his voice ringing with raw bravado. &#34;This is it! My moment to finally stand out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could respond,he spun on his heel and charged right back out the door. The three resumed their meal,unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol said casually. &#34;All this over a business deal? Is it worth getting this excited?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot Cedric a knowing look</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered a calm smile. When someone finally finds the courage to take the first step, it gets easier to keep moving forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With adrenaline pumping through him, Nikolas was ready to do something big But at the company&#39;s entrance, he saw Hamilton, whom he hadn&#39;t seen for a long time</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the momentum drained from Nikolas in an instant.The fire in his chest dimmed beneath Hamilton&#39;s cold judgmental stare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood with his usual smugness, amms folded,chin tilted slightly up. &#34;So, this is your company? Is this your big leap toward independence? Go on-show me how far you&#39;ve really come on your own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then marched straight into Nikolas&#39; company, not bothering to wait for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,how many people are working here now?&#34; he called over his shoulder, his tone dripping with challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept close behind, answering. &#34;We&#39;ve got just over a hundred employees now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s laughter rang out-loud,scomful,echoing through the open workspace for everyone to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hundred? Really?&#34; He shot Nikolas a sidelong glance, eyebrows raised. You&#39;re acting like you&#39;ve actually accomplished something. You walked away from a family business with real power just to start a company with over a hundred people? That&#39;s what you call ambition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat. Hamilton kept walking, his gaze sweeping the office with clear contempt. &#34;I figured you were running off to Daniela because she&#39;d hand you some cushy position But all you&#39;ve got is this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nikolas opened his mouth to argue,Hamilton&#39;s gaze shifted to the staff moviing around the office.&#34;Would you look at these people? No uniforms, no sense of order. Anyone stepping in here would think it&#39;s a chaotic startup run by amateurs&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39;s hands balled into fists behind his back.knuckles white. as he forced himself to swallow the anger boiling up inside him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamtton cast a scomful look over the room. &#34;This is what you call a company? Pathetic. And you look exhausted. Those dark circles-don&#39;t you feel ashamed dragging our family&#39;s reputation through the mud? Next time you step outside, don&#39;t even think about calling yourself a McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That biting phrase was Hamilton&#39;s favorite weapon.hurled so often it hit with bruising force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his fists, struggling to keep his simmening anger in check</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the matter? You don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying?&#34;Without wanting for a response. Hamilton grabbed the project proposal from the table and started thumbing through it like it was nothing &#34;So this is what you&#39;re working on now?&#34; Someone once begged to present thus exect project to McCoy Group, but we wouldn&#39;t waste a second on it Yet here you are, chasing after it like it&#39;s gold&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nooles hand hovered itching to reclai the proposal.but Hamalton smacked the folder down on the table The sharp crack echoed in the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in that mistant it was as if Hamulton hadn&#39;t just tossed the proposal aside but had haurled a bitter insuft straight at Nikolas pride</p>
