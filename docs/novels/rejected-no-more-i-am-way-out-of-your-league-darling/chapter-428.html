                <p>Daniela plugged the phone she had taken from the man at the restaurant into her laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrolled through the photos and videos again, confirming they were just clips of Cedric&#39;s daily routíne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could these recordings be for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked on the first contact and opened the chat with the ID labeled&#34;b.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mimicking the man&#39;s previous tone, she typed, &#34;Hello. I have today&#39;s video ready. Should I send it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reply right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone buzzed with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Hurst Craig at the mental hospital.&#34;Ms. Harper, Caiden wants to meet with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela typed a response, the phone connected to the laptop buzzed.&#34;b&#34;had replied with a simple,&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, Daniela sent a voice message to Hurst, saying,&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,she sent the blurry video of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person on the other end quickly transferred $15 thousand to her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela accepted the payment, but then saw an angry emoji followed by,&#34;Are you scamming me? Look at the video you sent today. It&#39;s barely watchable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danielå typed back, &#34;Today&#39;s video is a bit blurry, but | did my best. Cedric is very cautious, so I can&#39;t get too close. I&#39;ll make sure tomorrow&#39;s is better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another angry.emoji came through, along with a message. &#34;If tomorrow&#39;s quality is the same, I&#39;ll find someone else.&#34; Daniela, copying the man&#39;s tone, replied with a feigned sense of worry, &#34;Okay, okay. But why do you need so many of Cedric&#39;s daily videos? You&#39;re not planning anything illegal, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other side went quiet. Daniela leaned back in her chair, waiting for a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five minutes later, a reply came. &#34;Don&#39;t ask so many questions if you want to make money!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela read the message on the phone screen, she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it seemed familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She typed again, &#34;When I was filming Cedric today, Daniela happened to be there. Both she and Cedric are very powerful. I only want to make money, but it feels like I&#39;m risking my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she sent the message, the other side stayed quiet for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten minutes later, a reply appeared. &#34;It&#39;s not anything illegal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela thought for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,she quickly typed some commands on her computer, and within seconds, she had gained access to the other person&#39;s account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found that the only contact they had was the man, with no other personal details that could be useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk played on Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were certainly cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the sparse conversation history, and once again, that sense of familiarity returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to check her phone for any connections, a knock came from outside the bathroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, are you finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced up at the door and responded,&#34;Nearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, hurry up! I&#39;ve got a new massage technique I learned today.It&#39;s really good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, closed the laptop, took a quick shower, and stepped out of the bathroom. Even after all this time, Cedric still loved spending every moment with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she came out of the bathroom, Cedric was already there, his cheerful smile a stark contrast to the serious CEO he was at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did it take you so long today?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I stayed in the bath a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric pulled Daniela close, his arms around her, resting his head against her neck. His voice was low and husky as he whispered, &#34;Honey, let&#39;s have a baby. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was startled, and her body shook in surprise. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction made Cedric pull back, sensing something was off.&#34;Why? Don&#39;t you want to have a child with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their last argument,Cedric had learned something important about Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he couldn&#39;t be more ruthless than her, but he also knew that if he was gentle with her, she&#39;d find it hard to say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently,he had come across a saying that struck a chord with him. &#34;To keep a womarl by your side for life,having a child is essential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wholeheartedly agreed with it and was now set on making it a reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to have a baby with Daniela, believing that would ensure the best person in the world-Daniela-would always be by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Daniela felt completely drained. She was usually in great shape, but even she felt overwhelmed by the intensity of their intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before she lost consciousness, she looked at Cedric through the soft glow of the bedside lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His abs were slick with sweat, his V-line and toned waist standing out in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His intense gaze was locked onto hers as his lips met hers, and in that moment, Daniela couldn&#39;t help but wonder if Cedric was really focused on having a baby with her, or if his goal was just to wear her out completely.</p>
