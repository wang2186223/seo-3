                <p>Alexander was at his wits&#39; end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For ages, Cedric had never once made a move against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such behavior seemed beneath Cedric, as though he considered it beneath him to sully his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,Alexander had been living in a bubble of security. Why then was Cedric now showing his displeasure?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander grappled with his confusion, a distressing call from the company broke through. It seemed Phillips Group had poached several of their long-standing clients overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who resisted signing with Phillips Group found themselves swallowed up through hostile takeovers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining clients of Bennett Group were now quaking in their boots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the phone, Alexander&#39;s secretary asked, &#34;What&#39;s our plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was at a loss for words. Later, a tip from an ally revealed they had paid a handsome sum to bribe a manager at Phillips Group for insights. The aggressive strategy, it turned out, was all because Joyce had crossed Cedric. The manager also sneered that Alexander was cursed by bad luck to have married such a disaster like Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury blazed within Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that staying abroad would do no good, he booked the next flight home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arriving, he tore off his tie in frustration and flung his briefcase onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to summon Joyce, Richard burst in, seething. &#34;Joyce&#39;s kept a boy toý!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s world stopped. He stared icily at Richard, disbelief etching his features. He squeezed his eyes shut, struggling to cage his wrath. &#34;How long has this been going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face was a picture of fury. &#34;It&#39;s been whispered about for some time, but she&#39;s only recently started flaunting him in public. Now the whole town&#39;s abuzz. It&#39;s utterly shameful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard shook lis head in revulsion. &#34;That&#39;s the last straw. You need to divorce her. There&#39;s no telling what other stunts she&#39;ll pufl. She&#39;s thrown decency to the winds. Just last week, she conned four million dollars from Dániela and squandered it with that man in mere days. Now, she&#39;s roped Katrína into her schemes to drum up more cash. Joyce has completely lost her senses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He massaged his temples wearily. &#34;We need to discuss this divorce tonight. I refuse to live under this cloud of disgrace any longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Richard retreated to his room, clearly drained and disgusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina,equally shamed, agreed to meet with Richard and Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander arrived, Katrina greeted him with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face was set in stone as he walked through the living room, his eyes briefly meeting Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the sofa, legs crossed, engrossed in her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander knew Cedric was absent, tied up at an internationalconference as its keynote speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian were absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing in the living area, Alexander addressed Daniela, who seemed lost in her own world, &#34;It&#39;s been a while,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lack of response was as if she deemed the conversation beneath her interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to talk to Joyce shortly. Care to join?&#34; Wary of a rejection, Alexander added, &#34;Could be interesting gossip for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded flatly, &#34;Not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed his lips together, holding back further comment, and moved towards the dining room where Katrina and Joyce were already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s laughter was scornful. &#34;Really, Alexander? Inviting Daniela to join us? What are you playing at? Looking for your next trophy wife? Think dumping me wil impress her? Has anyone ever told you you&#39;re acting like a complete ass lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander took a seat, his demeanor cool. In his eyes, Joyce was already nothing more than a stranger. Her affair was a thorn in the side of his business, but beyond that, he felt nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The loss of a major business deal because of her was the last straw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolute about the dlvorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His invitation to Daniela was indeed a signal that he was back on the market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina clung to a sliver of hope for reconciliation. She smiled weakly.&#34;Joyce, stop talking nonsense. You two are the married couple here. He invited Daniela simply because she&#39;s alone and he thought she might be bored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sneered. &#34;The whole world knows what&#39;s really going on. Spare us the facade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the door swung open, and the servant announced Richard&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard paused in the living room, addressing Daniela warmly. &#34;Hello, Daniela. It&#39;s chilly today, isn&#39;t it? Make sure you keep warm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce overheard Richard&#39;s cordial words. She curled her lips into a scornful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once upon a time, Richard had scorned Daniela, but now here he was, pretending to be considerate. How utterly laughable!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Richard caught sight of Joyce&#39;s mocking smirk, his previously good spirits vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat down, his face a mask of granite, clearly in no mood for niceties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt a familiar fire of anger flare up within her.</p>
