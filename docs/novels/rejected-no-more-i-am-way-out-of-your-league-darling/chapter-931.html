                <p>Daniela and Cedric couldn&#39;t believe their eyes when Hamilton&#39;s attitude changed completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, Hamilton could hardly stand to be in the same room as Daniela. Now he seemed determined to treat her like a treasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wide grin broke across Hamilton&#39;s face as he looked at her and remarked, &#34;You&#39;re making me proud,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever he remembered how Josh and his siblings had stormed out, their faces twisted with frustration,the thought nearly made him want to crack open a bottle and celebrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite all this, Daniela still couldn&#39;t get a read on Hamilton&#39;s mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several members of the McCoy family had already settled down, and Hamilton&#39;s second son was already a father. Why did Hamilton behave as though the very concept of a child was brand new to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her hand on her chin, Daniela spoke up, her voice cool and steady.&#34;Don&#39;t get too excited. Just so we&#39;re clear, this baby is mine. The McCoy family has no claim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant those words landed, Hamilton&#39;s good mood evaporated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary reached for his arm and whispered,&#34;You need to think about her feelings. She&#39;s pregnant, and it&#39;s not good to upset her. You don&#39;t want the baby to develop a temper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle reminder brought a spark of cheer back to Hamilton&#39;s eyes. &#34;Let&#39;s not talk about anything else right now. Your well-being is all that matters. I&#39;ll make sure every appointment and all your care is handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Hamilton left the villa with energy in his step. He announced that he would start a production line of clothes to provide exclusive outfits for his  grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol had been watching the whole thing in disbelief.She turned to Daniela and said, &#34;Did he forget you work in fashion? Elite Lux already makes high-end clothes for kids. His factory can&#39;t compete with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas came in at that moment, waving his phone in the air. &#34;Dad has asked the factory to start producing everything for the baby. He just sent a message.You&#39;re now the most important person to everyone in our branch, and nobody is allowed to give you any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clicked his tongue and grinned. &#34;Now the entire family is supposed to revolve around the baby.I just saw Dad in the hallway. He was smiling so much he didn&#39;t even notice me walk by. I&#39;ve never seen him act like that before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela seemed unfazed by the fuss. With a soft smile, she glanced-at Cedric, who looked completely dazed. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Are you so happy that you can&#39;t find the words?&#34;Cedric kept staring, as though he was afraid that Daniela would disappear if he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a playful glimmer in her eyes, Daniela leaned forward. &#34;Tell me, would you rather have a boy or a girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no hesitation from Cedric. He beamed at her and answered, &#34;A girl! I hope she&#39;s just as clever as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Nikolas couldn&#39;t help but laugh. &#34;You know, if it turns out to be a girl, Dad might be crushed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It never even crossed Cedric&#39;s mind to care about that. Boy or girl, it made no difference to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that truly mattered was that this child would be Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His greatest hope was for Daniela to stay healthy and safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If a child came into their lives, that would be a wonderful gift. If not, Cedric could accept that too. Somehow, the news had left Cedric in a bit of a fog He wandered through the day as if caught in a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid tried to stifle a giggle. &#34;Mr. Phillips looks like he&#39;s still recovering from the shock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Cedric shuffle through the halls, Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a gentle, amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spell didn&#39;t last, though. Cedric soon returned to his senses and surprised everyone by offering the maid an extended holiday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody in the house saw that coming. The mnaid stared at him in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a reason, sir? Did I do something to upset you?&#34; she asked, wide-eyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric simply shook his head. &#34;You didn&#39;t do anything wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with the time off, he slipped her an envelope with a generous bonus inside. With that settled, Cedric turned his attention to Nikolas and Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s voice echoed from the living room. &#34;Wait a second, you want us out of here? What&#39;s this about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat back, arms folded as he regarded the pair across from him. &#34;My wife is expecting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in Nikolas&#39; eyes. &#34;We&#39;re already aware, Cedric. Are you worried about Daniela? We would never-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise washed over Nikolas, who had assumed Cedric would handle the situation with subtlety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Cedric spoke with unwavering directness.&#34;That&#39;s right. I am concerned you might harm her.Let me put it plainly. The last time my wife was pregnant, a problem arose because of a servant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas protested, &#34;We&#39;re family, Cedric. We would never put your child in harm&#39;s way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow shake of Cedric&#39;s head followed. &#34;The servant who caused trouble last time was someone I&#39;d trusted for many years. She practically raised me.Still, she betrayed me. I can&#39;t risk that again, so for the next nine months, I have to keep Daniela as safe as possible. That means removing every risk, no matter how small.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flickered between Nikolas and Damon as they traded glances. &#34;But we&#39;re nothing like that servant.Daniela&#39;s safety means everything to us, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Cedric set his jaw. &#34;This isn&#39;t a debate. I&#39;m not asking. I&#39;m telling you how it&#39;s going to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at his watch punctuated Cedric&#39;s resolve.&#34;You&#39;ll have two hours to pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion swept over Nikolas and Damon as they began gathering their belongings. On their way out,they passed Hamilton&#39;s secretary guiding in a whole parade of experts. There were nutritionists, a doctor,a chef, and more. Each one had been personally selected by HHamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes in the hallway lingered on Cedric as he closed the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, are you seriously planning to look after Daniela around the clock? Do you honestly think you can manage everything on your own-her meals,her health, her check-ups? That kind of responsibility just isn&#39;t practical.&#34;</p>
