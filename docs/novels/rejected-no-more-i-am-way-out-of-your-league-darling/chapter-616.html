                <p>When Daniela reached the top of the stairs, her gaze fell on a small container sitting on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a quick glance at it, a strange sense of familiarity washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol walked in and said, &#34;Cedric just dropped this off.He knows you&#39;re swamped with work but wants you to eat something. It&#39;s not a full meal, just some sushi rolls he made. He hopes you&#39;ll give them a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes lingered on the food box for a moment before she lowered her head, returning to the reports spread across her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corporation was deep in deficit, and no one had expected an economic crisis of this scale to hit such a major company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Carol hesitated before continuing,&#34;When you fell into a coma three years ago, the company&#39;s three shareholders took over. Before our veteran members could react, they transferred all assets, production lines, even sales into their new company called Eternity Glory. By the time we realized what had happened,it was too late.&#34; Daniela nodded while scanning the figures on the report. The deficit had soared into the trillions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moreover, the domestic Elite Lux has been in decline for the past three years due to poor management,and morale within the company is now at an all-time low.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had only just recovered, yet she was already forced to address these pressing issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corporation&#39;s internal debt crisis needed an urgent solution, or Elite Lux would be a sinking ship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol lowered her head, her eyes reddening. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.I failed to protect Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the stillness of the night, Daniela offered a gentle smile. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to apologize for. Elite Lux is my life&#39;s work. No matter what they rename it, they can&#39;t take away what&#39;s mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced at Daniela. She looked even more fragile than she had after divorcing Alexander. Yet whenever she smiled with confidence and poise, it felt as though even the greatest challenges could be overcome with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol inhaled sharply and nodded. &#34;You&#39;re right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed up, working late into the night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Elite Lux&#39;s three-year stalemate, many still had faith in the company and in Daniela. She couldn&#39;t afford to let them down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t expected Carol to bring Cedric upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been waiting downstairs. It&#39;s cold out, so l figured I&#39;dbring him up for a cup of coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood by the office door,his expression slightly gloomy, though a faint smile lingered at the corners of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it convenient?&#34; Cedric asked,his tone noticeably more polite than Alexander&#39;s ever was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t step in right away, lingering in the doorway,watching her from just beyond the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come inside,&#34; said Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cool breeze drifted through the doorway, carrying a faint trace of cologne that instantly sharpened Daniela&#39;s drowsy mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric settled on the long sofa without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued her work, but she could feel his gaze lingering on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Cedric wondered if he was caught in a beautiful dream. Otherwise, how could something he had yearned for so long be standing right before him? He had once lost the woman he loved. Now, with his beloved back before him, he wished for nothing more than to thank God for this moment of happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even thought that losing another leg wouldn&#39;t matter if it meant keeping this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, he had carried nothing but resentment towards the world that had taken her from him. But now, those dark thoughts faded away, replaced by a sense of peace as if he were the happiest man in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted nothing else, only for her to be safe and well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even forgot that Daniela had lost her memory</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, she would remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric.&#34; Daniela finally broke the silence, setting down her pen and meeting his gaze. &#34;How much longer are you going to stare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric offered a shy smile. &#34;Sorry, I&#39;ll remember that next time. Are you hungry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scent of Cedric&#39;s cologne still lingered in the air,strangely soothing. Daniela leaned back in her chair, studying Cedric. &#34;Did we get married before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s back straightened slightly as he nodded.&#34;Yeah. We did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even though I can&#39;t remember why I married you,I know myself. I&#39;m not someone who would gamble my future on a whim,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smiled faintly. &#34;No, you wouldn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your leg... Carol told me you got injured while trying to save me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t shy away from the weight of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was willing to tell her anything she wanted to know.&#34;Yeah, there was an explosion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked, &#34;Do you need me to help you find a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head. &#34;I already have one. He&#39;s is a friend and very responsible. There&#39;s no need for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt somewhat relieved. She appreciated Cedric&#39;s honesty, so she chose to be honest as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t recall the past. So, to me, you&#39;re just an old classmate. I don&#39;t know how we used to interact, and right now, I can only engage with you in a way that feels natural and comfortable to me. I don&#39;t know when or if I&#39;ll ever regain my memory or if I&#39;ll manage a family for a long period. And honestly, I can&#39;t afford to focus on it right now. Elite Lux is facing serious issues that require my attention, and I have no way of predicting how long it will take. So...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Cedric&#39;s gaze. &#34;If this bothers you,or if you feel it&#39;s necessary, we can consider adivorce.&#34;</p>
