                <p>Hackett shot Huey a subtle, knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey caught on instantly. Emboldened, he stepped up once more, clutching the megaphone. His voice thundered across the rooftop. &#34;No, I won&#39;t meet with Daniela Harper! I&#39;II end it all right here, on the Elite Lux building! I&#39;ll sacrifice myself to pave the way for my fellow association members! Daniela! Isn&#39;t this what you wanted? If I die, will that finally satisfy you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The association members discreetly signaled their approval with quick thumbs-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of pride swelled in Huey&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a smirk, Hackett called out, &#34;Huey, truust me. Daniela will be here soon. She&#39;s reasonable-just state your demands, and she&#39;ll give in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t even here. Yet Hackett was already making promises on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a trending headline appeared, &#34;Daniela Promises Huey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett checked his device, grinning as the story gained momentum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Huey had lingered on the rooftop too long. The dizzying height unsettled him, and he cast Hackett a wary glance, silently signaling that he wanted to step down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elite Lux building loomed far too high-far too terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s glare was sharp, a silent command for Huey to hold his ground. &#34;Huey, don&#39;t be reckless! Daniela is on her way. Once she gets here, everything will be settled in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was clear-Huey needed to wait for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others agreed that only when Daniela showed up and made a statement would it truly count.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey glanced over the edge once more. No fire trucks. No safety nets. Just empty space below. His anxiety spiked. A creeping unease gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step back! Daniela has arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Huey&#39;s foot instinctively snapped away from the ledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The livestream audience erupted in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, is he jumping or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, if Hackett hadn&#39;t yelled that Daniela was here, Huey would&#39;ve climbed down by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something&#39;s off. This feels staged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally agree!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he really wanted to jump, why is he clinging to that railing like his life depends on it?&#34; It&#39;s like he&#39;s afraid of actually falling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s jaw tightened as he read the comments, irritation flaring. He shot Huey a sharp look. &#34;Pathetic. He can&#39;t even pull off a convincing threat,&#34; he scoffed internally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the police escorted Daniela to the scene. Cedric trailed closely behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett quickly raised a hand to block Cedric. &#34;Hold on, Cedric. The guy up there is threatening to jump,but he didn&#39;t ask for you. No reason for you to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze hardened into ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett turned to the officer. &#34;Look, we&#39;re business rivals, and there&#39;s been tension between us. Huey is on edge. It&#39;s best to play along-unless you want a disaster on your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer hesitated for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning,Cedric stepped forward, pulling Daniela behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll help talk him down, but I won&#39;t let my wife be put in harm&#39;s way. Huey is unstable. If he jumps, there&#39;s a chance he could take Daniela down with him. We&#39;re willing to help, but we&#39;re under no obligation to risk our lives. Either I go with her, or you deal with this yourselves.&#34;</p>
