                <p>As Alexander stepped into the conference hall, his eyes immediately caught Daniela signaling something subtle to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Lillian spun around and shot Alexander an icy, hostile glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused by her reaction, Alexander wondered what he could have done to spark such hostility. When Lillian faced him, he offered a polite nod, but her response was a just scornful smirk. &#34;You really have a knack for disappointing everyone, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bidding session commenced without further delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, preoccupied with his personal turmoil,found it hard to focus and respond to each bid effectively. After several rounds, he had failed to secure any significant contracts. Ultimately, he settled for a minor project with barely any profit to show for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, he caught Daniela sending yet another signal to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that the realization hit Alexander-he&#39;d been set up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained seated in the audience, a bitter taste of defeat settling in. The bidding was done, and there was no turning back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, those who once envied Alexander&#39;s perceived closeness to Daniela began to snicker discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought he was someone important. Turns out,he&#39;s all bark and no bite!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Acting like he&#39;s close to Ms. Harper, but she barely spares him a glance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He always acted so high and mighty. Who was he trying to fool?&#34; &#34;Can you believe the nerve? Showing up at his ex-wife&#39;s event! I heard he got tangled up with Ms.Harper&#39;s stepsister, and that&#39;s why she left him.Apparently, he treated her terribly until he realized how rich she&#39;d become!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! I thought he had integrity and pride. Turns out, he&#39;s just another gold digger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hell yes! All polished and proper, but probably just trying to approach Ms. Harper for her wealth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This bidding just knocked the Bennett family off their pedestal in Olisvine&#39;s construction world.Serves them right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd burst into laughter, their voices echoing around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s fists tightened at his sides as he fixed his glare on Daniela, who walked past him with an air of composure, her steps steady and deliberate. His voice dropped to an icy, measured tone as hespoke.&#34;I used to carry guilt for the way I treated you. l wanted to make things right. But I never imagined you&#39;d twist my regret to your advantage in this bidding and make a fool of me. Daniela, from this moment on, we&#39;re square!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a faint, almost disdainful smile. Her voice carried the same chill as her expression. &#34;Don&#39;t overestimate your importance.I was in a good mood after a nap and decided to have a little fun with someone oblivious. If your skills fell short, don&#39;t blame me for it. Are you really so easily influenced? Perhaps you&#39;re just not cut out for handling greater challenges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to leave, she suddenly stopped, throwing an amused glance over her shoulder. &#34;If you&#39;re truly as principled as you claim, you wouldn&#39;t have gone for that minor project. You&#39;d cut ties entirely-with me and Elite Lux. So, what&#39;s it going to be? Are you backing out now? The ink isn&#39;t dry yet; you still have a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gripped the documents in his hand tightly,feeling the sting of Daniela&#39;s words strike at his pride. He wanted to fire back but found himself unable to utter a single word in response. All he could do was watch as Daniela, her mocking smile lingering, walked away without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Alexander experienced a level of humiliation unlike anything he&#39;d ever felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aimlessly drifting out of Elite Lux, Alexander bumped into Richard, who greeted him with the eager energy of someone picking up their kid from school. &#34;So?Did Daniela give you the project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head, his expression steeped in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not? Didn&#39;t you say she gave you two options?If you didn&#39;t choose her, shouldn&#39;t she havehanded you the contract as the logical outcome?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander looked up at the towering structure before him and let out a bitter laugh. &#34;This was never about a choice. She just wanted to humiliate me. She still holds a grudge. Daniela, your heart must be made of stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Alexander was overcome by a severe fever. After hours on an IV drip, he eventually began to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the ordeal, he allowed his hair to grow out,adopting an increasingly somber and withdrawn demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While working on various construction sites,Alexander occasionally caught sight of Daniela. But he never attempted to approach her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he maintained his distance and observed her with a cold, detached expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, he found himself spending more and more time with the Harper family, particularly growing closer to Katrina and Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On bright, sunny afternoons, his gaze often drifted to Joyce&#39;s growing belly. One day, he asked, &#34;So,when&#39;s the baby coming? Have you decided on the hospital and doctor yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went as far as arranging for a top-notch medical team to admit Joyce into the hospital an entire month before her due date. Relaxing in her hospital bed the other day, Joyce took a bite of an apple. &#34;Mom, I think Alexander&#39;s more excited about this baby than I am. It&#39;s like he really wants to be with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina narrowed her eyes, trying to decipher Alexander&#39;s true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed genuinely invested in the child&#39;s well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Joyce went in for a checkup, Alexander appeared more nervous about the results than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for anyone suspecting he harbored romantic feelings for Joyce, his actions suggested otherwise.He&#39;d usually show up, sit silently, and hardly say a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s hopeful smile grew as she continued,&#34;I guess Alexander likes me. And I like him too.Could you talk to Dad? Once the baby is born, we&#39;ll get the inheritance, and Alexander can marry me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to the string of unsuitable suitors Katrina had found for Joyce, Alexander seemed like a far better catch.</p>
