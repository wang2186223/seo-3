                <p>Throughout the drive back, Daniela remained silent, her gazefixed on the passing scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived at Elite Lux, she reached to unbuckle her seatbelt, only to feel Cedric&#39;s hand clutching the sleeve of her jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced down at his hand. His fingers, long and tense, were gripping her sleeve so tightly that the tips were turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric noticed her looking and, for a brief moment, his fingers gave a small, almost hesitant twitch. But instead of releasing her, he gripped her sleeve even tighter, as if letting go wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her eyes to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the bright lights of Elite Lux&#39;s grand entrance, she saw the resolute determination etched in Cedric&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, she said simply,&#34;Letgo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of obeying, Cedric&#39;s grip grew firmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened before he spoke, his voice low but brimming with emotion. &#34;Tell me, Daniela, what makes Alexander better than me? Why does he get a chance, and I don&#39;t? Whatever it is you don&#39;t like about me, I&#39;ll change it. Just tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained quiet, her lips pressing into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he let go of her sleeve. His shoulders sagged, and in a softer tone, he muttered, &#34;Never mind. Just go upstairs.&#34;	J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden shift in his tone caught Daniela off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear Cedric didn&#39;t want to release her, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to force her into an uncomfortable situation. He hated seeing her upset and refused to be the reason behind her distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela thought about giving a simple excuse to brush him off. But when she looked at Cedric, with his quiet patience and sincerity, she realized she couldn&#39;t bring herself to lie. So she chose to tell the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting up straighter, she met his gaze and began to speak slowly. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re a kind person, truly. But you&#39;ve seen everything that&#39;s happened to me, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lifted his head, his eyes searching hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft glow inside the car cast shadows across her face, leaving half of it obscured in dim light as she sat upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I once tried with everything I had to chase after Alexander,&#34; she continued, her voice steady but distant.&#34;The entire city saw it, so there&#39;s no need for me to rehash the story. I thought I loved him, thought I wanted him more than anything. But the day our divorce was finalized, all I felt was relief. That&#39;s when I understood -no matter how much you think you love someone, those feelings can erode. Little arguments, tiny cracks,day by day, they break even the strongest connections. In the end, most relationships are built on shared goals, not passion or romance. Take Caiden, for example. He adored my mother. If she so much as took a sip of coffee, he&#39;d fret over whether it was too hot. If she went to a party, he&#39;d stand outside the villa all night, just waiting. I thought that was the greatest love anyone could ask for. But what happened? Not even a week after my mother died, Katrina moved into her room, took her spot, and sat at her dressing table like it was hers all along. I&#39;ve seen all kinds of ugliness in life, but nothing compares to the darkness that people hide in their hearts. Mine&#39;s been empty for a long time. I have nothing left to offer. Cedric, you&#39;re special.I truly hope you find someone equally special, someone who can give you what you deserve. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela managed a faint smile as she looked at him.&#34;Let&#39;s just be friends for life, okay? Once the initial spark fades, what&#39;s left is just the wreckage of routine and boredom. Why go through all that trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she reached for the door handle and pushed it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped out of the car, but before leaving, she glanced back at him. Her voice was gentle, almost kind.&#34;Go home, Cedric, and get some rest. Tomorrow morning, we&#39;lI still be friends who can count on each other.That&#39;s more than enough, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve always been distant, Cedric. Loving someone is never come naturally to me. Alexander wasn&#39;t wrong when he said that. If I had truly loved him during those ten years, I wouldn&#39;t have walked away as easily as I did. That just proves my feelings were shallow. The truth is, l&#39;ve always loved myself more than anyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered Cedric a faint smile, her voice gentle but firm. &#34;Choosing someone like me, Cedric, would only mean settling for less than you deserve. Why do that to yourself? You&#39;re too smart for that, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she stepped out of the car and shut the door behind her with a soft, decisive click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of her parting words snapped Cedric back to reality. He leaped out of the car and bolted after Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the building&#39;s entrance, his hands trembled as he fumbled for his keycard. When he finally got inside, the elevator doors were already closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dashed up the stairs, taking them two at a time. But the second he arrived at Daniela&#39;s apartment, he heard the faint click of her door closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knocked on the door, urgency in every pound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Josie appeared, her eyes heavy with sleep.′′Siriwhat&#39;s the matter? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t answer. His heart was racing, consumed by frustration and regret over his missed opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raced upstairs and pounded on Daniela&#39;s door with renewed desperation. But the door remained firmly shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric leaned against the door, his voice breaking as he spoke. &#34;Daniela, stop lying to me! You&#39;re not Alexander-you&#39;re not heartless! And I&#39;m not like you. I won&#39;t let misfortune dictate my life! You call me smart, but I&#39;m not. I&#39;m just a fool. When I set my heart on something, I don&#39;t let it go!Ever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after he finished speaking, his breaths came heavy, yet he stood his ground, refusing to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the far end of the hallway, Lillian and Ryan froze, their eyes wide with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of stunned silence, they exchanged glances and gave Cedric an encouraging thumbs-up For the first time, he was taking a stand for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Cedric remained resolute. He sat quietly outside Daniela&#39;s door, his back against the wall,waiting patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to lay bare every emotion that had been bottled up in his heart.</p>
