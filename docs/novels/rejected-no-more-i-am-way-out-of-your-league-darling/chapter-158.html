                <p>The moment Daniela&#39;s words hit him, Cedric&#39;s shoulders went rigid, his tension palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained hunched over for an extended period, his heart racing wildly in the oppressive quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he gradually straightened, his eyes locking with Daniela&#39;s for a brief moment before he could utter a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, the office door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina appeared in the doorway, her face buried in her hands,sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of breath, the secretary burst into the room,her voice trembling. &#34;Ms. Harper, I&#39;m so sorry! I tried to stop her, but she pushed right past me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina collapsed against the desk, her tears falling uncontrollably as she begged, &#34;Daniela, your father is in a dire state! You need to go to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rippled through Cedric&#39;s face, his features  twisting in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering through her handkerchief, Katrina caught Daniela&#39;s gaze-cold, detached, her piercing eyes unflinching as they stared back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A relentless pounding filled Katrina&#39;s chest, her heartbeat surging with raw emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you looking at me like that?&#34; Katrina demanded, her panic barely masked by a sharp edge in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sensed an unspoken accusation in Daniela&#39;s steady gaze, an intangible something she couldn&#39;t identify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh dear!&#34; Katrina&#39;s distress intensified, her actions becoming more theatrical. &#34;Daniela, you can spew all the nonsense you want about cutting ties, but at the end of the day, his blood still runs in your veins. Your father&#39;s about to die, and you act like it&#39;s nothing What the hell is wrong with you? How can you be so ruthless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose slowly, her eyes narrowing,scrutinizing Katrina as if she were a suspect under interrogation.&#34;Yes, I am ruthless. Knowing that, why bother coming to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, taken aback, had not anticipated such calm composure from Daniela, nor such a chilling retort. For a brief moment, she was momentarily speechless,the thick layers of makeup unable to mask the crimson spreading across her cheeks. &#34;You...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny how this works,&#34; Daniela declared, her voice sharp and emphatic. &#34;Caiden was perfectly healthy before.Now,suddenly, when I take over the company,he becomes sick? Katrina, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little too convenient to be a coincidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Cedric glared at Daniela, his mind racng.She had the chance to destroy the Harper family and turn the company inside out, but instead, she only took 51% of the shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s heart raced, yet she managed to maintain a composed facade. &#34;Daniela, what exactly do you mean by that? Are you implying I harmed your father?Even if you refuse to acknowledge me as your stepmother, my devotion to your father is genuine.I couldn&#39;t possibly want any harm to come to him just for some minor profit. If you truly doubt his condition,perhaps you should verify it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was icy as she fixed it on Katrina.&#34;Harper Group means more to you than a &#39;minor profit,&#39; doesn&#39;t it? You&#39;d stop at nothing to get what you want,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A luxury villa and offshore assets-how could anyone reduce those to minor profit? Daniela turned and made her way downstairs, Cedric on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached the car, she swung the door open and found Cedric already waiting inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela tilted her head slightly, a faint, amused smile playing on her lips. &#34;Cedric, honestly, you don&#39;t have to follow me around like this. They wouldn&#39;t dare touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face was a mask of icy severity, contrasting sharply with Daniela&#39;s demeanor. He fixed her with a piercing gaze and questioned, &#34;What are you suspecting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing Katrina&#39;s mention of Caiden&#39;s illness,Daniela had remained unmoved. But Cedric&#39;s question made her hesitate momentarily. Then, with a faint smile, she responded, &#34;What could I possibly suspect?Didn&#39;t Katrina accuse that I suspect she refused to return the money and decided to hurt Caiden over it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric crossed his arms, his gaze unwavering and full of curiosity.&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, chuckling. &#34;And what more is there to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think? Is there more?&#34; &#34;I&#39;m not sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was gripped by a suffocating stillness, thiek with unspoken tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver stole glances at them through the rearview mirror, picking up on the charged atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly were they discussing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could grasp each word, but their conversation seemed like a puzzle, the pieces not quite fitting together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through the rde. Daniela started to think Cedric had given up on conversation entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cedric exhaled sharply, turning to face her more fully. &#34;Why did you only claim 51 percent of Harper Group&#39;s shares? Why weren&#39;t you surprised about Caiden&#39;s condition? And why did you confront Katrina in such a manner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was bombarded with questions, each one striking with increasing intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver,eavesdropping with a mix of curiosity and confusion,found himself pondering the same things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stole another glance at her through the rearview mirror. This time, Daniela remained silent, her usual poise replaced by a visible unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, she seemed genuinely troubled,sparking a flicker of intrigue in the driver. He was about to look again when Cedric&#39;s intense gaze turned from Daniela&#39;s perturbed expression to the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Cedric&#39;s scrutiny, the driver quickly straightened up, his attention snapping forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then...&#34; Daniela began, her voice lacking its usual conviction. &#34;Why do you think that is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know! But there must be a reason you&#39;re keeping from me!&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice brimmed with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As someone who held a high position, he was accustomed to masking his emotions. But now, his fury was unmistakable,coursing through him alongside the sting of betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you don&#39;t need to explain yourself, but until I grasp your intentions, don&#39;t assume you can operate independently. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolute about not leaving her side until he had neutralized any threats. His intuition hinted at the motives behind Daniela&#39;s actions, though he remained uncertain. Clenching his jaw, his grip tightened on his knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to look at her, the interplay of light and shadows from the passing streetlamps casting her features in a dramatic relief. Her eyes,usually vibrant,now appeared dim and weary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight softened his resolve momentarily, and he found himself reluctant to press her further.</p>
