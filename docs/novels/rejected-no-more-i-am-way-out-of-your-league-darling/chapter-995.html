                <p>Brad and Ethan froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, they had their suspicions, but since it didn&#39;t affect them, they had chosen to ignore it. After all, they were gaining from it, so why dig into it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They kept using their father&#39;s final wishes as an excuse to avoid facing the ugly truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They acted like they were innocent bystanders, yet they made sure to enjoy every benefit the McCoy family offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad looked like he was about to explode, his face tight with indignation, but then he stopped himself. His shoulders sank slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at Daniela and said, &#34;Hey, maybe it&#39;s time to move on. Wouldn&#39;t it be nicer if we all just lived peacefully?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small laugh and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking she was agreeing, Brad grinned. &#34;We&#39;re all family here. No need to keep grudges, right? You&#39;ve always been the kind and understanding one, Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to his shock, Daniela said, &#34;If you can bring back the child I lost, then I&#39;ll forgive everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s smile evaporated in an instant. &#34;But that child is already gone. How are we supposed to do that? Isn&#39;t that asking too much from us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned and began climbing the stairs. &#34;Then don&#39;t expect this to end anytime soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad watched her go, completely thrown, then turned to Hamilton with a helpless look. &#34;So what now? Are we expected to pay with our lives for something that happened ages ago? We didn&#39;t even do anything. If anyone&#39;s responsible, it&#39;s Josh and Dad. What&#39;s this got to do with us? Hamilton, you&#39;re her father-in-law.Talk to her. If you don&#39;t step in, Daniela&#39;s going to take us all down with her Hamilton moved to the side and said, &#34;She told me the younger ones won&#39;t be dragged into this. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s easy for you to say. I&#39;ve lost all of my money. Didn&#39;t you see that?&#34; Brad got irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan chimed in, equally frustrated. &#34;Exactly! Our money is in Jules&#39; hands now. Do you think that&#39;s fair? lf Dad were alive, he&#39;d never let this happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stood there quietly for a while, his head bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But eventually, he couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly looked up, his eyes sharp and full of anger as he stared at his two younger brothers. He had held back for too long. All the patience he had left had just run out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fair? Have any of you ever treated me fairly?&#34; he snapped. &#34;Dad promised he&#39;d give the family assets to his first great-grandson. Why did my daughter-in-law&#39;s unborn baby have to die? When the family wealth was being split, did anyone ever say, &#39;Hamilton deserves more for all the years he&#39;s carried this family?&#39; No.When Dad died, he filled the company with roadblocks, all because he feared I&#39;d take over. Did that look fair to me? Who has ever treated me fairly? Tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he pointed upstairs toward Daniela&#39;s room. &#34;It was Daniela. She was the only one who gave me any sense of justice. When Dad passed away, I said I wanted to investigate what happened to the baby Daniela lost.And how did you all respond?&#34; His stare fell heavily on Brad and Ethan, forcing them to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed one finger after another. &#34;Josh said Dad had strictly forbidden any digging into it. And you, Brad?You said it was all in the past, and uncovering the truth would only bring more shame to the family. Jules?He brushed it off by saying it was just a baby, and that we could always have another. And you, Ethan? You wouldn&#39;t even meet with me. All of you acted like none of this mattered. Like this had nothing to do with you.But did you ever stop to think a day like this would come? Even if Dad were still alive, I&#39;d say the same thing now. Someone from my family was lost. That matters. Someone should be held accountable. Luckily,Daniela is smart and strong. If she hadn&#39;t fought back, that child would have died for nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamnilton had never spoken so openly before. In a family where he was always the afterthought, he had spent his whole life swallowing his pride and pushing through, just for a sliver of recognition. He still didn&#39;t know what crime he had committed to deserve such disregard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he ever wanted was warmth and love from,his family. But the sad part? He forgot that the very thing he was chasing... was the one thing his sons had never had, either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had sacrificed a lot for the McCoy family over the years, even letting his own sons suffer broken marriages for the family&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even gone to look for Cedric..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shame of it all weighed heavily on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, because of Daniela, he finally had a chance to let out all the anger he&#39;d been holding in for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, he might still be here, pretending everything was fine-still playing the fool.</p>
