                <p>Daniela cleared her throat and quickly took the shrimp back from Cedric&#39;s plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes followed her every move. She coughed again and muttered, &#34;Peel it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Caiden and the rest kept quiet, not daring to come down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the dining room emptied out that Caiden&#39;s door finally opened. Joyce stepped out of her room too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught sight of the half-eaten dishes and immediately fumed. &#34;Tasha, are you confused about who owns this place? Who told you it was okay to let them eat here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack broke into tears. &#34;Daniela&#39;s just some evil woman &#39;showing up to eat our food!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden flinched. He feared Daniela just as much as he feared being sent to the mental institution again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to Tasha and snapped, &#34;Next time Daniela shows up, throw water on her. This is my house!&#34; Tasha stood her ground. &#34;I&#39;ve seen the news. This place belongs to Daniela. She&#39;s always lived here,even before the explosion. This is her home,not yours. I had no reason to stop her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face turned red. &#34;How dare you talk back?You&#39;re just a servant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha didn&#39;t blink. &#34;Being a servant doesn&#39;t mean1′m not human. If you were so sure of yourself, why didn&#39;t you come downstairs and say that to her face instead of leaving me to deal with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Daniela had been patient and polite with her. If it had been someone else, they would have taught her a lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela had been there, Caiden and Joyce hid upstairs like frightened kids. Now that she was gone,they tried to act like they weren&#39;t scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce raised her hand in a rage, but Caiden stepped in and grabbed her wrist. &#34;WVhy are you arguing with a servant? Figure something out. Daniela won&#39;t back &#39;down, and if she&#39;s serious, we&#39;re not staying here for long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha added, &#34;She said she&#39;s moving in tomorrow and told me to ask you both to move to the guest rooms downstairs. And just so you know, I&#39;m done. I&#39;ll be leaving tomorrow.&#34; She&#39;d already been thinking about quitting, but Caiden had begged her to stay because he liked how she cooked. They treated her like she didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her experience, Tasha could get another job anytime. Why should she put up with this kind of treatment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she walked back to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was barely a livable space. Once a storage room, it had no windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were plenty of better rooms in the house.Joyce made sure she stayed in the worst one-because she believed that was what servants deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was still muttering angrily outside the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock came on Tasha&#39;s door not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean up the guest rooms tonight. We&#39;re moving downstairs,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha lifted her brow, surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t look like much-slight, quiet-but they acted like she had them cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha didn&#39;t argue. She was getting paid,so she went straight to work. Meanwhile, in the livingroom, Joyce stood with her hands planted on her hips. &#34;Why does Daniela act like she&#39;s better than us? She can&#39;t even have kids. And now she wants me in a guest room? Downstairs?What if Jack grows up and refuses to take care of her?&#34;Her voice was sharp with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the point of having money when there&#39;s no son to carry her name? Who&#39;s going to look after her when she&#39;s old? Who&#39;ll even show up at her funeral?She&#39;s rich and still wants to live here with us? Honestly,that explosion should&#39;ve ended her three years ago!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha caught the whole thing.Without thinking twice,she hit record. Neither Caiden nor Joyce noticed a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden let out a heavy sigh. &#34;She&#39;s a disgrace. I still don&#39;t understand how I raised such an ungrateful daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to him. &#34;Dad, you have to help me.Jack&#39;s too fragile to stay in some cramped guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha chimed in, &#34;That guest room downstairs? It&#39;s actually pretty big. It&#39;s over fifty square meters. Most families live in a hundred-square-meter apartment with three people. That guest room is fully furnished and way above average. Isn&#39;t that enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce rolled her eyes. &#34;What would you know? Jack is meant to inherit everything. Hes the future of Elite Lux. How can he stay in a place like that? Dad, you have to stand up for us tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s face went pale. He couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the mental institution. &#34;Just deal with it for now.Don&#39;t push her.&#34; With that, he disappeared into the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her fists. Her eyes narrowed like she was planning something. She bent down beside Jack and whispered, &#34;Jack, you&#39;re my only hope now.&#34;</p>
