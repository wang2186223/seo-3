                <p>On that day, Caiden returned from abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating at Daniela&#39;s kitchen, he finally settled onto the living room couch. &#34;If you want a divorce,fine. But splitting the family fortune? Not on my watch,&#34; he declared flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina hadn&#39;t genuinely intended to pursue a divorce. At her age, starting anew was not on the cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat of divorce was merely a gambit to coerce Daniela into rescuing Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Katrina hadn&#39;t anticipated was Daniela pulling Caiden into the fray to confront the issue head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a panic, Katrina fell to Caiden&#39;s feet. &#34;Honey, I know this mess is Joyce&#39;s doing, but can&#39;t you find it in your heart to save her? Please?&#34; Caiden flicked her hand off his knee with disdain.&#34;Save her? How about you save me for a change?Look at the havoc you&#39;ve wreaked on this family!can&#39;t step outside without whispers that I fathered a disgraceful daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina dissolved into tears. &#34;I know. It&#39;s all Joyce&#39;s fault. But you&#39;ve doted on her for so many years.Please, she&#39;s still your daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of regret crossed Caiden&#39;s face. &#34;Had I known Joyce would turn out like this, I would never have welcomed her into our family! I pushed away my own daughter for her, and now I&#39;m filled with remorse. I&#39;ll make it clear to the public that I have only one daughter-Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Caiden shoved Katrina aside and stormed out into the yard, where he promptly called his lawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Caiden issued a public statement severing all ties with Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The statement also declared his intention to divorce Katrina, consolidating the Harper family&#39;s control under him and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This announcement was not merely a step to distance the Harpers from the scandal wrought by Katrina and Joyce, but also a strategic move to ingratiate himself with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the topic of mending his relationship with Daniela arose, Cedric was quick to interject.&#34;There&#39;s no fixing what&#39;s irreparably broken. Daniela has all the care she needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Daniela glanced up at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood before her, much like a guard dog protecting its territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was taken aback by the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Cedric had always shielded Daniela, yet he&#39;d maintained a respectful distance, never overstepping his boundaries or speaking out of turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now? Cedric appeared empowered, advocating for Daniela without a second thought. What was the nature of their relationship now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they an item?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, their united front would be a formidable force in the nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a level of influence that could intimidate the most stoic observer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s demeanor softened as he turned his gaze to Daniela, his voice almost pleading. &#34;Daniela, my dear, our blood ties are undeniable. Regardless of past events, think of the money I took as merely a father&#39;s due support from his daughter. Can we agree on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had long become immune to Caiden&#39;s audacity.However, Cedric was seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fury was almost tangible as he stepped closer,his presence imposing. &#34;Taking what&#39;s not yours and labeling it a freebie? The world doesn&#39;t operate on your whims, Caiden. Let&#39;s be clear-you&#39;ve burned this bridge.&#34; Cedric had once given Caiden a chance to prove himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Caiden last departed, he must have sensed Katrina&#39;s brewing schemes. A single word of caution to protect Daniela would have sufficed, yet Caiden remained silent. Instead, he chose flight over fight,preoccupied with his own safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a man was unfit to be called a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric didn&#39;t wait for a response. He took Daniela by the hand and led her to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed, and as Cedric held her, she patted his back. &#34;Why waste anger on someone like him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, still fuming, replied, &#34;Daniela, I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re still smiling. My heart breaks for you!&#34;</p>
