                <p>&#34;Richard, I appreciate your time, so I&#39;ll get right to the point. You see, after Alexander and Daniela&#39;s marriage -which, frankly, was less than ideal-they ended their union just days after the ceremony,&#34; Katrina explained, her smile unwavering. &#34;I admit, some of the blame falls on Caiden and me. We failed to guide Daniela appropriately. Her temperament really isn&#39;t cut out for domestic life. We could see Alexander and Joyce are a match made in heaven. Their chemistry is undeniable, and frankly, I&#39;m quite fond of Alexander.I&#39;ll be blunt since everyone&#39;s here. Alexander is the perfect fit for my daughter, and I&#39;m not settling for less.Richard, wouldn&#39;t it make sense to let him and Joyce be together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was visibly stunned by her frank approach. He thought Katrina would wait for him to bring up the topic, but she mentioned it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the eyes of everyone around the table bore into him, he felt the weight of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred by Richard&#39;s silence, Katrina continued, &#34;Of course, our approval isn&#39;t enough;your blessing is essential. But I know you have the foresight to look beyond our family&#39;s superficial prestige. Take Daniela,for instance. Despite her wealth, what does it truly amount to without her family&#39;s support? Does she even have anyone left to lean on? Any parents? Wealth is fleeting, and Daniela&#39;s fiery spirit hardly makes her manageable. Even during her time with Alexander, she maintained her distance. Did Alexander ever truly get close to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard pivoted, catching sight of Alexander&#39;s furrowed brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s laughter held a sly undertone as she teased, &#34;No hand-holding, no kissing-what sort of romance is this? Merely Platonic? Despite her strong feelings for Alexander, she never wavered from her beliefs.There was a time when she had nothing to her name. Now, as the head of Elite Lux, she commands respect from hundreds of employees. Do you think she&#39;d bother listening to you? Bennett Group&#39;s performance this year isn&#39;t even a third of what Elite Lux has achieved. In a family, the main earner often holds the reins. Had Alexander remained with Daniela, he certainly wouldn&#39;t be the one making decisions today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes flickered with triumph as she observed Richard&#39;s hardened gaze and pressed on. &#34;However, Joyce is a different story. She&#39;s been nothing but sweet and endearing since her youth, maturing gracefully like fine wine.&#34; Her stare intensified as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was on the verge of responding when Katrina leaned forward to fillhis glass once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My daughter now stands as the sole heiress to the Harper famil. You grasp the weight of that, don&#39;t you?Unlike Daniela, Joyce isn&#39;t idly waiting. Should today pass without a resolution, we will seek alternatives. As the heiress to the Harper family, she&#39;ll have no difficulty securing a match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile and a look of sly confidence, Katrina&#39;s expression was enigmatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was stuck in a tricky situation with no easy way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was keenly aware that Daniela&#39;s burgeoning success might tempt the Bennett family to mend fences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she simply stand by and watch Daniela&#39;s and Alexander&#39;s lives remain intertwined?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolved, Katrina had determined that should the Bennett family spurn this chance, she would seek alternatives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was resolute: Joyce&#39;s golden years would never be sacriiced for a worthless, unfaithful fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard raised his glass to his lips, savoring a brief sip before attempting to set it down, only to find Katrina proffering her glassright in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an unwavering smile, she suggested, &#34;Shall we toast to new beginnings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard perceived Katrina&#39;s gesture as a call to take a stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The allure of the advantages Daniela offered was strong, yet thoughts of Joyce lingered...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a sidelong glance at Alexander, who was absorbed in his phone and detached from the unfolding drama,Richard exhaled a resigned sigh, his fingers poised to clink glasses with Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as their glasses were about to meet, a disruptive retching noise halted the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze followed the near-touch of their glasses, thwarted unexpectedly. Richard placed his glass back on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, is everything alright?&#34; he inquired, his tone laced with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had been straining to tolerate the discomfort, yet the pervasive fishy odor overwhelmed her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flapped her hand in front of her face, her complexion ashen, and suddenly shoved her chair back,bolting towards the restroom of the secluded dining area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud,gut-wrenching retch echoed from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward hush descended over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The continuous sound of gagging stripped the appetite from everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brow creased in concern. &#34;What could she have eaten to react like this? What&#39;s happening?Everyone, please, keep eating.&#34; She stood, attempting to smooth over the disruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Ronald&#39;s wife leaned closer to him and murmured,&#34;Why is Joyce so violently ill? Could she be pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she voiced the thought than a chilling silence fell over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to the sudden focus on her, she went on, &#34;When I was expecting my first, the morning sickness was dreadful. Didn&#39;t Joyce mention the fish smelled particularly strong today? Though she&#39;s usually fond of it. If she&#39;s turned against it, perhaps she is indeed pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speculative whispers triggered a vivid memory among the Harper family members.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had once remarked with absolute certainty, &#34;Joyce is the epitome of innocence, never so much as held hands with anyone. She&#39;s never dated anyone at all.&#34;</p>
