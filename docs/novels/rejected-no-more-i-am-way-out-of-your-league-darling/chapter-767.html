                <p>Hamilton&#39;s office was packed, with five people standing inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same five who had been trapped in the elevator just moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them, Nikolas&#39; secretary, was among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon seeing Nikolas, the secretary glared at him with a mixture of bitterness and sorrow, before hiding his face in his hands and quietly sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, unfazed, ignored the secretary&#39;s reaction and turned his attention to Daniela. She sat on the sofa,casually chatting and laughing with Hamilton, as if the calamity had never occurred</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with Nikolas, Daniela asked, &#34;Surprised to see me here, safe and sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression hardened, his mood shifting instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of Nikolas&#39; ambitions, his dreams of victory.evaporated the moment he stepped through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Nikolas demanded, unable to mask his disbelief He couldn&#39;t comprehend how they could still be alive The sound of the elevator plummeting had been deafening, and the impact had been catastrophic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela should have been dead. There was no possible way she could have survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bHow could she possibly be sitting here now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was completely incomprehensible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was frosty as she responded, &#34;If I Hweren&#39;t here, where do you think I should be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas almost blurted a response but caught himself when he met Hamilton&#39;s cold, menacing stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together and,with a resigned sigh,muttered, &#34;I just found out about the accident.I thought something happened to you, so l hurried here to inform Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a slight smile.&#34;Nikolas, you didn&#39;t even bother to check the scene,yet you were so sure we were all gone. And when you walked in just now, you looked almost pleased. But now, you seem disappointed. You&#39;re upset that we didn&#39;t die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said it with complete certainty. Nikolas ground his teeth together &#34;Daniela, stop talking nonsense! My brother was in that elevator! How could I be happy if something happened to him? I was just eager to report what happened. Your twisted ideas are just a reflection of your own malice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela chuckled. &#34;Oh, really? So now you&#39;re claiming to be kind-hearted? Then why did the elevator malfunction? Was it an accident or negligence? For McCoy Group, failing to properly maintain an elevator points to eitherincompetence or intentional sabotage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at the elevator technician standing near the door behind Hamilton. &#34;So, which one is it?Negligence or sabotage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician shook with fear at her words. He retorted, &#34;It&#39;s not my fault. I&#39;ve been doing regular maintenance, and I have the records to prove it. This has nothing to do with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze to Nikolas. &#34;Then whose fault is it? If you can&#39;t explain, you won&#39;t just lose your job There were five people in that elevator, and I won&#39;t let you off the hook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician didn&#39;t recognize Daniela, but he noticed her confidently sitting beside Hamilton,and the fear in her commanding presence made him tremble. &#34;Mr. McCoy, I swear it wasn&#39;t me! The moment the accident occurred, I was ready to rush to their aid,but Nikolas trapped me in the surveillance room. I couldn&#39;t get out! I had no control over this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression shifted into one of immediate anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a thoughtful nod, her voice dripping with sarcasm. &#34;So, this is your doing, Nikolas? I&#39;m puzzled.Didn&#39;t you mention earlier that your brother was in that elevator? You couldn&#39;t care less about us,but you didn&#39;t even care about your own flesh and blood? If your brother means nothing to you, what about the McCoy family&#39;s reputation? What will the world say about McCoy Group if this comes to light? Will they claim that McCoy Group can&#39;t even handle basic elevator upkeep? How will anyone trust the company&#39;s competence? You haven&#39;t even taken control of the company, and yet you&#39;re turning on your own family? So, what happens when you finally take over? Will you eliminate everyone in your path?This is your own brother, the one who grew up alongside you.How can you be so cold and calculating?I&#39;m truly impressed today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had brought Daniela in to discuss Cedric&#39;s return to the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after Daniela&#39;s biting words, Hamilton was left in complete embarrassment. He couldn&#39;t manage even a single word in reply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do was force a strained, insincere smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela and the others departed, Hamilton slammed his cup onto the desk, the sound echoing through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot a cold, furious glare at Nikolas. &#34;Are you an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This marked the second time since Daniela&#39;s arrival in Oiscoll that Nikolas had been labeled an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands balled into fists, his body coiled with tension.Anger and shame surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you persist in this madness, there will be no place for you in McCoy Group or our family. How could I have raised such an idiot?&#34; Hamilton continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas dropped to his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened, his heart heavy.He couldn&#39;t deny that he had always favored the children who remained by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Nikolas kept down this reckless path,Hamilton would undoubtedly reconsider the succession</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nikolas, I&#39;ve told you before-fight for the inheritance if you must, but never harm your siblings  Did my words fall on deaf ears?&#34;</p>
