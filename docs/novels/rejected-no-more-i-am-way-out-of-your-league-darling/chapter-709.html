                <p>Lately, Daniela had been showing up at the office less often.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was making a bomb. Daniela&#39;s presence at the company could pose a risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a strong feeling that Natalie&#39;s planned explosion would happen within a day or two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t see coming was Alexander showing up at that exact moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was at the gate, walking her dog, when Alexander stepped out of his car and walked toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had intentionally pulled back security at the gate to allow Natalie through, but running into Alexander hadn&#39;t been part of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela.&#34; Alexander rushed over, clearly uneasy. &#34;There&#39;s something I need to explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling her dog in her arms, Daniela settled onto a chair beside the garden table. &#34;I really ddon&#39;t think there&#39;s anything left for us to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after she spoke, Daniela noticed an unfamiliar car slowly pulling into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus shifted completely to the vehicle approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, are you even paying attention to what I&#39;m saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave Alexander a quick look. &#34;You should go. I&#39;ve got a few things to handle today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; Alexander&#39;s tone sharpened with frustration. &#34;I need to explain everything. There&#39;s been too much confusion between us. If I don&#39;t clear it up now, you&#39;ll keep thinking the worst of me, and we&#39;ll never fix this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela listened to him with quiet frustration, feeling cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed and said, &#34;There&#39;s nothing to misunderstand. I really don&#39;t have time for this today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far off, Natalie appeared to notice the presence of someone and chose to remain inside the car,not stepping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in his own emotions, Alexander didn&#39;t notice that Daniela wasn&#39;t even focused on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went on, &#34;Just hear me out. I never meant to work with McCoy Group. I know they&#39;re after you and Cedric. I don&#39;t care about Cedric, but if they&#39;re coming for you, I won&#39;t stand by and let that happen. This deal between Bennett Group and McCoy Group is all a big misunderstanding. I&#39;ll go back and end it. Daniela,I lost you once. I&#39;m not making that mistake again. I won&#39;t give you up over business or money. Daniela,l meant every word when I said I&#39;d give my life for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after he stopped talking, Alexander felt the presence of someone quickly moving towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever it was, they were closing in faster by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned and saw Natalie, the woman who should&#39;ve still been behind bars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sprinting toward them, clutching a bomb tightly in her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes flew wide in disbelief as cold sweat instantly formed on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very next moment, he saw Natalie yank the detonator cord from the bomb with no hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting purely on instinct, Alexander turned and bolted without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela flashed throughhis mind, but there was nothing he could do except keep running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela watched with an icy stare as the man who had just vowed to die for her now ran off faster than a missile launch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint laugh escaped her lips. She knew men&#39;s promises were nothing but empty words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of her thoughts, a sudden force grabbed her and hurled her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze, her senses overwhelmed. She caught a familiar scent, then felt the weight of a body shielding hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head found rest against a solid chest. The rhythmic thump of a heart reverberated in her ear, loud like a drumbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lifted her gaze, her eyes meeting Cedric&#39;s jawline, taut with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay,&#34; Daniela whispered. &#34;The explosives in the bomb were swapped with flour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric froze for a moment, his gaze softening as he looked down at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear and panic hadn&#39;t completely left his face, and his heartbeat remained uneven and wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; Cedric asked, his doubt clear in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a nod, her voice firm. &#34;Yes, and if you doubt me, just look at her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned his head and saw Natalie being restrained by Carol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep sigh of relief escaped him, as cold sweat trickled from his forehead, landing on Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch was cool, a stark contrast to the heat of his panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped him, raw and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the face of danger, fear was a natural response for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet despite his fear, Cedric had charged forward without a second thought, placing himself between her and the threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t help but feel a flicker of surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she realized that Cedric&#39;s feelings for her might run deeper than she had imagined.</p>
