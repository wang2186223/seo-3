                <p>The reporters exchanged uneasy looks, unsure whether they should stay or leave the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Caiden, who had come in with confidence, now seemed eager to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Katrina wasn&#39;t ready to let it go. She subtly tugged at Caiden&#39;s sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d dropped nearly twenty thousand to bring these reporters in. If they left now, it would be a total waste of all that money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, they hadn&#39;t yet accomplished what they came for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina leaned in and whispered to Caiden, &#34;Do you want to fix things with Daniela or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden bit his lip, clearly wanting to say something, but after catching a glimpse of Cedric&#39;s expression,he held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I shouldn&#39;t have slapped you yesterday. I&#39;m here to apologize. Katrina and I got up early today and made this soup just for you. Eat it, and let&#39;s put everything behind us. Yesterday was a mistake. Please don&#39;t hold it against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters behind him were snapping photos, capturing every word and every exaggerated gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina smiled warmly. Rather than passing the insulated lunchbox to the secretary behind Daniela,she opened it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rich scent of soup filled the air, and the reporters began snapping shots of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, darling, just take one little sip, and we can forget all about what happened. Take a look around-there&#39;s a whole crowd here watching us. Even though you&#39;re the CEO of Elite Lux now, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to show a bit of respect to your dad. And as for those things you said yesterday about cutting ties, those shouldn&#39;t be said again. Do you have any idea how much it hurt your father? He sighed all night. Look at him; he&#39;s even got a white hair now, all thanks to the stress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words depicted Caiden as a caring, regretful father who deeply regretted losing his temper and slapping his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden didn&#39;t hesitate to jump in, his voice dripping with self-importance. &#34;Daniela, listen to me-you have to realize that everything I do is for your benefit. You&#39;re my daughter. If I don&#39;t look out for you, who else will? When you mentioned cutting ties yesterday, do you even understand how deeply that cut me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at Daniela&#39;s unfeeling, distant expression, then quickly shut his eyes for a moment, cursing her silently in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out to her, his insincere smile growing wider as he spoke. &#34;Come here, sweetheart.Did I hurt you too much yesterday? Let me check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a step back. That look-intense and unforgiving-made a knot form in Caiden&#39;s gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a look he recognized instantly. The same one her mother had given him years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold. Unforgiving. Relentless. A headache. Just like her late mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden knew Daniela wouldn&#39;t fall for threats or compliments. But did it really matter? With all the reporters here,what could she do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already pretended to regret his actions. If Daniela dared to challenge him, the next day&#39;s headlines would be shouting, &#34;Daniela Harper: The Ungrateful Daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that label stuck, not even the top PR team at Elite Lux would be able to fix her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reputation was the core of any business. No one would back a company led by a CEO accused of being cold-hearted toward her own family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of triumph rushed through Caiden. Being her father gave him the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened his jacket, his chest puffing out with newfound confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Cedric? Who cared? He was just another man. Sure, Cedric might scare some people, but not Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t invincible, and today&#39;s little showdown made that crystal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A self-satisfied grin crept across Caiden&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, noticing his smug expression, gave his arm a gentle tug, a reminder to tone it down. Caiden quickly wiped the smugness off his face and replaced it with a mask of warmth and concern. He turned back to Daniela and said, &#34;Sweetheart, can you just forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood motionless, her cold, unflinching stare locked on Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time Caiden had used that word in years, not since she was five.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweetheart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, she had convinced herself that she wasn&#39;t worthy-like she hadn&#39;t done enough to deserve his love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed that if she worked harder, achieved more, and made herself irreplaceable, maybe, just maybe,she would finally hear him say &#34;sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had waited for that word endlessly. Even when she topped her class, it never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she skipped grades and joined the elite gifted program, still nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when she passed her exams at fifteen, becoming the youngest doctoral candidate in her field, it remained absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had finally accepted that, no matter what she achieved, she would never hear that word come from her father, not in this lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, there it was. Caiden, with a forced grin, had finally said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony was almost too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter laugh escaped Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes gleamed as he turned to the reporters, beaming while pointing at Daniela. &#34;See? She&#39;s smiling. That means she&#39;s forgiven me,&#34; he said, his focus entirely on how the reporters would see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face lit up, spotting her chance. &#34;Sweetheart, you&#39;re right-your father and I messed up yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shouldn&#39;t have put that pressure on you. The mix-up is all our fault. Joyce shouldn&#39;t have acted like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce couldn&#39;t stay silent and whined in objection, &#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Joyce&#39;s outburst, Katrina kept her calm and overly sweet demeanor, turning back to Daniela. &#34;You know, Joyce really looks up to you, Daniela. You&#39;ve been her role model. But, you know how she is. She struggles with everything, poor thing. At her age, still staying at home, it&#39;s been such a concern for all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stared at Katrina, her mouth hanging open, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Caiden furrowed his brow, confused by Katrina&#39;s sudden criticism of Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela saw through it. Katrina wasn&#39;t just throwing Joyce under the bus-this was the beginning of her real request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And, as expected, Katrina didn&#39;t waste any time before unveiling her true agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re still family, right? And as family, we&#39;re supposed tohelp one another. Joyce is young and has a lot to learn.Why not take her under your wing? Let her join you at Elite Lux, help her gain some hands-on experience. She looks up to you so much, Daniela, and has always admired everything you&#39;ve built with Elite Lux.Just offer her a director&#39;s role. It&#39;s no big deal-just a way for her to dip her toes in the water. I promise you, she&#39;ll give it her all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Joyce&#39;s face lit up instantly. The pout and the anger from before vanished in an instant. In their place, her lips curved into a smug, victorious smile as she looked at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already imagining all the perks that came with such an impressive title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,she thought, tossing aside the idea of running a tinyclothing store-becoming a director at Elite Lux?Now that was real prestige and allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was determined to become a director at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was just as thrilled by Katrina&#39;s suggestion. Her plan was pure genius. If Joyce could figure out how to earn money like Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t have to worry about relying on Daniela&#39;s generosity as he aged. Joyce could support the family just as easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning with excitement, Caiden quickly turned to Daniela and added, &#34;Yes, exactly. Just give her a director&#39;s role.&#34;</p>
