                <p>When Joyce came to visit her mother the following morning, her posture radiated arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, on the other hand, walked in with a grim expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The farce at their wedding had thoroughly embarrassed the Bennett family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Alexander hadn&#39;t intended to accompany Joyce. However, her dramatic outburst, complete with tears, screams, and threats of suicide, had pushed Richard to his limits, prompting him to insist Alexander escort her. Reluctantly, Alexander had complied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before their departure, Joyce had raided several valuables from the Bennett family&#39;s storeroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s expression was a show of displeasure as  he bid them farewell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s union with the Bennett family had been anything but beneficial; it had been a catastrophe.Richard&#39;s restraint was fueled solely by the hope that future profits from the robotics company might salvage the struggling Bennett Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s mind was far from such financial considerations. He was thoroughly disillusioned with Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweet,compliant woman he had known had become a domineering spouse, embodying every negative trait imaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrutinized his every action, demanded access to his personal phone, meddled in his secretary&#39;s duties, and dictated his social life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Merely one day into their marriage, Alexander was filled with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reflected on his previous marriage to Daniela,the differences were unbearable. Daniela had respected his independence, loving him quietly for a decade without ever attempting to curb his freedoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the drive, Joyce seemed to pick up on his distant mood. With a taunting smile, she said, &#34;I monitor you because I love you. Alexander, you&#39;re lucky to have such a devoted wife. Appreciate what you have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s mood remained dark throughout the journey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce gripped his phone tightly, making the cramped space of the car feel even more oppressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself thinking about what life might have been like if he had never divorced Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bennett Group wouldn&#39;t be in this mess. And if trouble had arisen, Daniela would have handled it,just like she always had in the past. She wouldn&#39;t try to use it as a way to gain control over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each passing moment, Alexander&#39;s regret  deepened. By the time they reached the Harper family&#39;s residences, the pressure seemed unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unconsciously, his steps led him towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s reaction was immediate; her hand gripped Alexander&#39;s arm with cold precision. She stared into his eyes, her voice sharp. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s gaze drifted to Daniela, and Joyce&#39;s eyes followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, seemingly unaware of their presence, was absorbed in the TV. Beside her, Cedric offered her a slice of orange, which she accepted and ate from his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, let&#39;s be clear,&#34; Joyce said, her voice slicing through the tension. &#34;Daniela has moved on.You&#39;re lucky I&#39;mn still here. You&#39;ll have to make do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words pierced Alexander, leaving a stinging sensation. Joyce turned away, dismissing him. Cedric stood by Daniela, the contrast between him and Alexander stark and evident. Daniela&#39;s choice,should she ever have to make one, seemed clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina pulled Joyce aside into her room. &#34;So,how was the first day as a married woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her dress, Joyce replied indifferently,&#34;It was disappointing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, her voice filled with worry. &#34;What do you mean? What went wrong? Was it the bedroom?&#34;Her expression was one of utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out a sharp, mocking laugh. &#34;He didn&#39;t even touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s eyes opened wide in surprise. &#34;What?&#34; She hadn&#39;t anticipated such a response. &#34;Alexander dislikes you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He never verbalized it, yet the signs were clear,&#34;Joyce said with a chill in her voice. &#34;As soon as we went home, his family avoided me completely.They  accused me of causing a debacle at the wedding,claiming | drove away significant, long-standing clients. Alexander showered and left for the office. It was nearly morning when he returned.&#34; As Joyce spoke, her irritation intensified. &#34;All night, I waited.Yet, the moment he arrived, he went straight into the study. In a rage, I shattered everything there.Without my outburst this morning, he wouldn&#39;t have bothered returning with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina looked at Joyce in utter disbelief. &#34;Your outbursts are excessive, Joyce. Our indulgence has clearly gone too far. You must understand, you&#39;re married now. Such behavior is unacceptable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s anger peaked. &#34;Do you believe Ienjoy this?Did you notice Alexander&#39;s expression when he glanced at DDaniela? It was filled with regret and longing. He clearly regrets marrying me. He never intended to marry me so soon. Alexander was taking a risk, hoping that Daniela would intervene and put an end to the wedding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the pace of events outstripped his expectations. The wedding concluded before Alexander could grasp the situation fully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just now, his gaze was fixed on Daniela, unwavering and intent. He seemed to have forgotten he was a married man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger brewed in Joyce, and Katrina&#39;s expression was one of deep concern. The gravity of the situation had caught her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;However, this changes nothing,&#34; Joyce said,her voice brimming with assurance. &#34;The Bennett family wouldn&#39;t dare cross me. With my control over the robotics shares, they&#39;re forced to appease me. And Alexander? He might as well make the study his permanent bedroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs, Joyce unexpectedly greeted Daniela before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing at the doorway, she turned sharply and called out to Alexander, &#34;Come on! Why are you still staring? No matter how much you look, she will never return to you.&#34;  Her words sliced through the air, a testament to Joyce&#39;s cruel precision in delivering verbal blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the top of the staircase, Katina observed the scene, her brow furrowed. Her eyes caught Daniela&#39;s fleeting,mysterious smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t quite understand, Katrina&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling thought suddenly crossed her mind, one she hadn&#39;t considered before, but now couldn&#39;t push aside.</p>
