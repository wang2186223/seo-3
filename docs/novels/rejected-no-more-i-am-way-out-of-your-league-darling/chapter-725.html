                <p>Charles studied Daniela&#39;s face, noticing a brief flash of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned smugly. &#34;Daniela, I know what you&#39;re looking into. It&#39;s not just the explosion, but the truth behind your mother&#39;s death. If you back me, I can help you uncover it. Furthermore, whatever is rightfully Cedric&#39;s-whether he decides to return to the family or not-l will make sure he gets it as long as I&#39;m in control. Also, while the McCoy family may seem peaceful, it&#39;s full of danger. Cedric doesn&#39;t care for family fortune, and you wouldn&#39;t want him caught up in this mess. If you pick me, I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed Charles, realizing how shrewd he truly was. She hadn&#39;t shown any bias toward Cedric,yet Charles had brought him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles chuckled. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re too smart to settle for working with fools. Controlling a pawn is dull- partnering with someone as sharp as me is where the real fun lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a sip of water, offering no clear response. &#34;I hear you. You can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles smiled as he walked out, adding, &#34;I&#39;llbe waiting for the good news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was full of confidence, seemingly certain that Daniela would pick him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he left, Carol came down from upstairs.&#34;Charles is too clever. People like him are hard to control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;It&#39;s more rewarding to deal with intelligent people. I can&#39;t achieve anything with fools.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol quickly realized Daniela had made her choice-Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated,remnembering how cheerful Cedric had been yesterday. &#34;What about Cedric? What&#39;s your plan for him?&#34; Daniela, usually so composed, felt a headache begin to form at the thought of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol said, &#34;I have a feeling Cedric&#39;s wrapping things up at the company. I saw him packing his bags this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol added, &#34;He&#39;s convinced you&#39;ll choose him for sure. If he finds out you&#39;ve chosen someone else,it will break his heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brow furrowed slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gazed at Daniela. &#34;Whether it&#39;s the McCoy family or anywhere else, we can protect Cedric.What are you truly afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned icy. &#34;You don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol replied, &#34;When I first met Cedric, I didn&#39;t like him.I thought he lacked ambition. But now I see he&#39;s responsible-a real man. He cares for you deeply. He was so happy yesterday. Can you bear to see him sad?&#34; Daniela didn&#39;t want to continue this conversation. But Carol pressed on. She believed Cedric was a good man. It was only when Cedric was near that Daniela seemed less distant, her coldness softening with a touch of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed and looked at Carol. &#34;If we could truly protect him, how did he end up with an injured leg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol pouted. &#34;That was an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela retorted, &#34;One accident almost took his life.People are fragile and can&#39;t handle too many accidents. He&#39;s lame now. I lost a child. We&#39;d been bedridden for three years. Do you get it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was left speechless for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed into the distance. &#34;There&#39;s a destined connection between people. When it&#39;s over, it&#39;s time to part ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol wanted to speak more but couldn&#39;t find the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was organizing the assets of Phillips Group, preparing to hand over control of the company to a professional manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary sighed helplessly. &#34;Boss, I can&#39;t believe it. You&#39;re the only CEO I&#39;ve ever seen who&#39;s always looking to retire. You&#39;re the CEO, the founder. If you leave,what will happen to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other companies feared that poor performance would result in layoffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Phillips Group was thriving, the CEO was unreliable, constantly thinking of running away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made them fear that the CEO might disappear one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary said, &#34;Boss, you need more ambition.We need to lift our spirits! What will you even do at home? Your wife has her own matters, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary felt drained, as if he&#39;d aged years overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained unfazed. He packed the documents into a box. &#34;I&#39;ll transfer everything to the professional manager. You&#39;ll stay as chief secretary, and the company&#39;s structure will remain the same. Your salary will increase by ten percent every year. Don&#39;t you want a house in Olisvine? Consider it a gift for your loyalty over the years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary wasn&#39;t sure whether to feel grateful or heartbroken. &#34;Boss, are you truly leaving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded. &#34;Yes. It&#39;ll be in the next few days.Have someone clear out what I won&#39;t be taking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary struggled to accept it, but Cedric walked away with an easygoing demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela was going over the new quarterly reports, the villa door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped inside, carrying a box, and with a cheerful grin, announced to Daniela, &#34;Everything&#39;s settled. When do we leave?&#34;</p>
