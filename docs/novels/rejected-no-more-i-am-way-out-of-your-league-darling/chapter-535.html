                <p>Daniela and Cedric arrived, only to find that Hackett&#39;s group had already made themselves comfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending not to notice Daniela, they remained clustered together, murmnuring in hushed, secretive tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curved into a mocking smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Hackett act as if he had just noticed Daniela.With exaggerated surprise,he exclaimed, &#34;Ms.Harper! What a rare sight! It&#39;s been ages. I&#39;ve been trying to invite you to dinner,but you keep turning me down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time in delivering a lighthearted reprimand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held her smile, unbothered by Hackett&#39;s remarks. But Hackett barely acknowledged her reaction,turning his attention to Cedric with a sudden change in attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone turned deferential. &#34;Mr. Phillips, it&#39;s been too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s companions exchanged glances, eyeing Cedric before briefly glancing at Daniela&#39;s small frame. Chuckling, they stood up, offering Cedric warm and polite greetings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear they saw Cedric as the true power behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, Daniela, with her youthful appearance,hardly seemed capable of making waves in the business world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paying no heed to their flattery, Cedric pulled out a chair for Daniela, his voice soft as he said, &#34;Have a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight men chuckled,exchanging knowing glances.&#34;Mr. Phillips, you truly dote on your wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett joined in, laughing. &#34;That&#39;s how it should be!A happy wife means a happy life, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc added with a smirk, &#34;No wonder your company thrive in business. We should take notes from you, Mr.Phillips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they talked, Hackett politely gestured for Cedric to take a seat. ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric settled into his chair, prompting the eight men across from him to do the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric sat with a straight posture, while Daniela&#39;s chair was slightly askew,making it appear as though Cedric alone faced the eight men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her petite frame almost swallowed by the oversized chair,Daniela faded into the background,easily ignored by the eight men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric poured a glass of water for Daniela, but she shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not thirsty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the glass in front of himself, Cedric offered,&#34;Want to go for a walk later? There&#39;s a new shopping plaza, and I heard they have great snacks. You&#39;ve been craving something sour lately, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod. &#34;Let&#39;s go once this is done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight individuals on the other side observed their conversation,exchanging glances as if they weren&#39;t even present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was known for being difficult to deal with,yet his attentiveness towards Daniela was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric stayed firm, their backup plan was to target Daniela instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, women could always be won over with jewelry,designer clothes,and lavish gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Modern women were all gold diggers anyway. Daniela couldn&#39;t possibly resist the temptation of wealth. That assumption put them at ease, making them believe the night wouldn&#39;t be a total loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They could only hope this business feud would end soon, or the entire association might fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back any longer, Farley spoke up first.&#34;Mr. Phillips, we&#39;re here not only to reconnect but also to discuss some pressing business matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting upright with an unreadable gaze, Cedric asked evenly, &#34;What business matters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the eight of them exchanged uncertain glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey let out a small chuckle, took a sip of water, and said, &#34;We&#39;ve met before, haven&#39;t we? At the last charity auction, we both had our eyes on a piece of jewelry,and you eventually...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,Huey was attempting to butter Cedric up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric lifted a hand to cut him off. &#34;Apologies, but l have plans to take my wife for a walk later. I&#39;ll give you fifteen minutes. Will that be sufficient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight men across the table froze in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifteen minutes?&#34; Hackett choked out. That wasn&#39;t even enough time for introductions. They had prepared extensive arguments and even planned to invite the couple to a private club later. But faced with Cedric&#39;s detached demeanor, Hackett swallowed his frustration. &#34;Fifteen minutes it is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a slight nod of acknowledgment. Even in casual attire,he carried himself with an air of authority that commanded respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s grin stretched wider, becoming even more obsequious. &#34;There was a minor misunderstanding recenty, Mr. Phillips,&#34; he said, pulling a pre-filled check from his pocket. &#34;I acted too rashly, and for that,I take full responsibility. The eight of us are here today to see if we can settle this matter amicably.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze flickered briefly towards the check resting on the table. His lips curled into a smirk. &#34;Do you take me for a beggar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno, ever the one to obsess over money, widened his eyes in disbelief. &#34;Mr.Phillips,did you look closely?That&#39;s two hundred million! Since when does a beggar receive that kind of sum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno had spent the entire night agonizing over the exact amount to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, a veteran in the business world, lounged back in his chair,tilting his chin slightly as he regarded them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture was casual, but the sharp glint in his eyes carried a silent challenge . &#34;This money isn&#39;t for me,&#34; Cedric said smoothly. &#34;My wife has a kind heart. There are countless homeless children in impoverished regions, and she hopes to unite charitable businesses to fund schools worldwide -working toward a world where poverty no longer exists.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s statement sent a chill through the eight men,leaving them uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A world without poverty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc let out an awkward chuckle, clapping hesitantly.&#34;Eliminating poverty worldwide sounds a bit ambitious.Perhaps we should start on a smaller scale? Maybe in Olisvine first? And your wife&#39;s vision is quite idealistic.Mr. Phillips, don&#39;t you think it would be wiser to take things step by step?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eight pairs of eyes turned to Cedric, waiting for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head effortlessly. &#34;That won&#39;t do.Kindness shouldn&#39;t have borders. And considering that you all are at the helm of the domestic business world,don&#39;t you think two hundred million is a little underwhelming for such an ambitious project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s thoughts raced as he hesitated before asking, &#34;Then, what would be an appropriate amount?&#34;</p>
