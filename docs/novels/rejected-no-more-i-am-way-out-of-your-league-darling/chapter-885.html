                <p>Hamilton mustered all his strength, prying his heavy eyelids open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the princess and said softly, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, but I&#39;m not feeling well today. Cedric just stepped out to find a doctor. I won&#39;t be able to host you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess glanced around, noticing Cedric was nowhere to be seen. A faint trace of disappointment flickered across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she had been digging into Cedric&#39;s life, reading everything she could find about him. She understood he was talented and fiercely loyal to his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to ask-if Cedric treats his wife so well, why did they end up divorcing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded, &#34;They lost a child, and that haunted Daniela deeply. She lost control and even became violent towards Cedric. Don&#39;t let her looks fool you-she&#39;s dangerous. You can check with anyone. Cedric gave up his career to dedicate himself completely to her. She even insists he cook for her daily. Burdened by lost dreams, Cedric is nearly broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he managed to squeeze out a few tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, standing close by, was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess listened, her eyes soft with sympathy. &#34;Cedric&#39;s a good man. He shouldn&#39;t have to go through this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the princess&#39;s kindness, Nikolas stepped forward to speak, but Hamilton jerked him back sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess looked confused. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Did he want to say something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shoved Nikolas toward the door, voice harsh. &#34;Stop daydreaming. Haven&#39;t I told you? The princess isn&#39;t interested in you. She likes Cedric. I tried to help, but it didn&#39;t work. Her heart&#39;s made up. Let her go. lf you cross her, I won&#39;t go easy on you. Now, get out!&#34; The princess gave Nikolas a regretful nod. &#34;My heart belongs to Cedric alone. I won&#39;t marry anyone else Please don&#39;t waste your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was left utterly speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess excused herself with grace, saying she wished to speak with Cedric privately soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton nodded brightly and waved her away with eager energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car disappeared, Hamilton&#39;s fake smile faded, replaced by a sharp, icy glare at Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you mess up my plans, I swear I&#39;ll kill you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s face contorted into a cruel sneer, making him look truly terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was filled with deep disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric has no feelings for the princess. I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so set on splitting Daniela and Cedric. Didn&#39;t you catch that flicker of admiration Cedric had when he looked at Daniela? How can you be so heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton waved him off. &#34;So what? What counts is cash, power, and ultimate fame. I don&#39;t get what you&#39;re saying. You&#39;ve been with Daniela too long, losing your mind and talking rubbish to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sighed, &#34;Having been with Daniela so long, I&#39;ve learned to hold on to integrity, dignity, limits, and self-respect. Some things in life mean more than money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton sneered, &#34;Oh really? Then forget about asking for any part of my inheritance later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His arrogance hung thick in the air, impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas answered firmly, &#34;Own up to what you&#39;re doing. Daniela has no clue about your scheme to match Cedric with the princess. She seems calm, but if she finds out, she won&#39;t forgive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot back with a glare, &#34;What did I do wrong? I&#39;m doing what&#39;s best for Cedric. If Daniela really cares, she&#39;d step aside. That&#39;s what&#39;s best for him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas knew then that Hamilton was hopeless. He sighed, turning away. &#34;I hope you&#39;re only faking illness today. You&#39;re my father, and I do wish you well.But I pray today&#39;s mess never happens again. Cedric stayed here for my sake. Now he&#39;s my friend. Don&#39;t use me to control him; that would shame me.&#34;&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying this, Nikolas walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes followed him, cold and filled with dark intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without bending Cedric, how else would the McCoy legacy keep its fortune alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolved to lock in the bond with the princess no matter what.</p>
