                <p>As Daniela sank into silence, Kohen stood stiffly, his nerves barely contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, believe me-I&#39;m the best choice you have. I might not have the elders&#39; favor like Nikolas, Charles&#39;sly wit, Damon&#39;s influential in-laws, or our father&#39;s favor like Duran. But what I do have is loyalty. I came looking for you in the middle of the night. Isn&#39;t that proof enough of where I stand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, Kohen slipped a black card from his pocket and offered it to Daniela. &#34;Two hundred million-a small gesture of the respect I have for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Hamilton kept his sons&#39; purse strings tight. That two hundred million? It was nearly all Kohen owned. If nothing else, this was a bolddisplay of sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go. I&#39;Il think it over,&#34; Daniela said, her tone frosty but calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen nodded eagerly. &#34;Of course. I&#39;ll go and wait for your good news!&#34; He backed away with a courteous bow, a polite smile plastered on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced at Daniela. &#34;So are you actually considering supporting him? Two hundred million is no small show of generosity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at the card, then spoke flatly. &#34;The ones who smile the most often hide the deepest shadows. Kohen&#39;s ambition isn&#39;t as harmless as he makes it sound. If it were, he wouldn&#39;t be the first to knock on my door-or have a network of secret intel hubs already running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol blinked, surprised. &#34;Do you think he&#39;s worth backing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the window across the room, Carol spotted Cedric. She turned back to Daniela. &#34;I honestly think Cedric is the best option.If we&#39;re talking smarts, none of the McCoy brothers can match Cedric. And when it comes to obedience, they don&#39;t even come close. There&#39;s no reason to build up a rival just to gain a foothold in the McCoy family. The brothers might be green, but the power behind them is real. If you put Cedric in charge, you wouldn&#39;t just have access-you&#39;d control it all. You&#39;d be holding the reins of the global economy.Isn&#39;t that a cleaner win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Carol&#39;s eyes, it was the perfect play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world&#39;s wealthiest man had joined forces with the second richest. In their wake, everyone else was powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze stayed steady, her eyes fixed ahead. &#34;You&#39;re simnplifying this far too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol turned to Daniela, a confused frown creeping across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice broke the silence, sharp and pointed. &#34;Do you really think Hamilton can be so easily deceived? He wouldn&#39;t just hand over the family fortune like that. Do you honestly believe the high-ranking families care about children born out of wedlock? It&#39;s always been about weighing interests and calculating the right gains. The McCoy brothers have been puppets in Hamilton&#39;s grasp for years, their finances held under tight lock and key. If Cedric joinedthe McCoy family, Hamilton would tighten his hold over him in the same way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice remained even, betraying.no emotion. &#34;It&#39;s unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol absorbed Daniela&#39;s words, and that all-too-familiar feeling returned. She always sensed that Daniela wasn&#39;t as detached from Cedric&#39;s fate as she let on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Carol opened her mouth to speak, she saw Cedric rise from his seat and head straight toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Carol stepped aside, giving him space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression soured as Cedric drew nearer, his steps sure and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew the words that were coming. But she wasn&#39;t ready to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, she turned on her heel and headed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, his voice cut through the nightair, deep and resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to fight for the McCoy family&#39;s fortune,&#34; Cedric declared, his words unwavering. Daniela frowned slightly, a swirl of emotions passing through her. She stopped, her thoughts heavy and tangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a conscious effort to ignore him, her pace quickening as she moved forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric&#39;s voice rang out again, louder, more insistent. &#34;I said I want to fight for the family fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela could no longer feign ignorance; his words had reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze chilled, and she slowly turned back to face Cedric. &#34;You don&#39;t need to fight for something you&#39;ve never desired just because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela understood him completely. His only ambition had always been her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met her gaze, unwavering, and said, &#34;I know exactly what I&#39;m doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela hadn&#39;t lost her memories, he would have poured out the truth he&#39;d been holding inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing he&#39;d ever truly fought for was her. But if Daniela chose to support others, to grow close to anyone else, he couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t fighting for the McCoy legacy or its wealth. He was fighting for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had always been certain of his desires, of what he was meant to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, he could say it without hesitation because Daniela had cared for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he couldn&#39;t speak it aloud, because Daniela would only feel burdened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter whether Daniela remembered the last three years or not, she would always be the one he was determined to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his partner in every sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his guiding star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever Daniela stood, that was where Cedric&#39;s heart would call home.</p>
