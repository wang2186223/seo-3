                <p>Daniela and Cedric stepped out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had meant to take a walk, but when the rain started pouring, Cedric grew concerned for her and decided they should head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car soon reached their destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once quiet and empty, the place now glowed with lights and pulsed with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the yard, strings of small lights twinkled while someone grumbled, &#34;Why did it have to rain? I was planning to have a barbecue out hee!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s voice thundered from inside. &#34;Are you out of your mind? This is Daniela&#39;s house. She likes things clean and can&#39;t stand the smell of smoke. If you want a barbecue, do it at your own home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran called back, &#34;Dad, I asked her. She said it was fine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton barked, &#34;No way! Daniela&#39;s pregnant. The smell from the grill is too strong. What if it makes her sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon sighed. &#34;She&#39;s about to give birth. She&#39;s not going to get morning sickness now.&#34; Hamilton was firm. &#34;Enough! No barbecue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole family was swept up in the noisy argument</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The front door of the villa was left wide open. From a distance, Daniela spotted several children sitting on the floor, building towers with blocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Cedric, and he met her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;They sure are a lively bunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression stayed stoic. &#34;Indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone noticed them and yelled, &#34;Hey, you two!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton barked, &#34;Show some respect!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela saw Hamilton coming out of the house. &#34;Where did you go for your walk? I&#39;ve been looking all over for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had meant to bring them an umbrella. His clothes were slightly damp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said, &#34;It started raining, so we just drove around for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton urged, &#34;Hurry up and get inside. Go take a hot shower.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went in while Hamilton kept talking non-stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room was crowded with people. As soon as Daniela and Cedric entered, everyone greeted them warmly, their faces bright with smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric headed upstairs to take a shower.From below, the sound of kids laughing mingled with the TV blaring and the McCoys talking about a drama on screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of warmth was unfamiliar to both Daniela and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After showering, Daniela sat down in a chair, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric came over, picked up the hairdryer, and gently dried her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled at him, and he returned the smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their reflections met in the mnirror.Daniela said,&#34;See?You should smile more. When you don&#39;t, they all think you&#39;re too stern and get scared of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had been tense all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s first pregnancy had not ended well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,he was overly careful, almost keeping everyone at a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to blame him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper who caused them to lose the baby had been someone Cedric had trusted. The guilt still weighed heavily on him. Naturally, his guard was higher now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed close to him, quiet and gentle, while the noise from downstairs filled the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally spoke again. &#34;It&#39;s all behind us. The babies will be healthy. Cedric, we&#39;ll have a happy family.Don&#39;t be sad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt his throat tighten. He lowered his eyes,letting a flicker of sadness show-something he never did in front of others. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low hum of the hairdryer filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cross-legged on the chair, Daniela said, &#34;Neither of us grew up in warm families, but we can give our children a home full of love. They&#39;ll grow up kind and good.We do have a future to look forward to, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric brushed his hand through Daniela&#39;s hair. &#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned her head slightly, eyes drifting toward the night sky. &#34;If my mom were still around, I think she&#39;d really like you as my husband. You&#39;re steady, good-looking, and dependable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really did have a lot going for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spoke with him, there was a freedom in her words that didn&#39;t appear around anyone else.Sometimes she rambled without much direction, but he never seemed to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They simply talked. Just the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their tones were soft and unhurried, floating gently through the stillness of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that quiet space, they both found peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s usual sharpness would melt away in these moments. She brought out a part of him no one else ever got to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That side of Daniela-he loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And more than anything, he loved not having to pretend when he was with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Cedric dried her hair, they ended up sharing a long kiss that neither wanted to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,Cedric mentioned she could go downstairs and grab some fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Daniela opened the door, Nikolas was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t caught off guard. She glanced once in his direction and walked past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHe quickly followed after her. &#34;Hey, wait up! I realy do need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed.&#34;Help? From the way you&#39;re standing there,I figured you just wanted to give me a headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sighed to himself. Seriously? Nobody was going to mess with her now. She was the family&#39;s favorite, and crossing her now was just asking for trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nikolas followed her into the kitchen. With a lowered voice, he said, &#34;Please. I need a hand with something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela picked up the fruit Cedric had set aside earlier and started eating as she asked, &#34;What are we talking about?&#34;</p>
