                <p>Daniela&#39;s rapid-fire questions rendered the group speechless, theirexpressions a mask of utter disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could easily discern their deceit and selfish apathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a cunning grin, she probed deeper, &#34;So,Winslow was behind this, wasn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured towards the surveillance camera perched above. &#34;You mnight want to choose your words carefully. I&#39;ve captured everything on video,just so you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as those words escaped her mouth, their complexions paled dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was the first to rise, his laugh tinged with anxiety. &#34;Well, we were merely engaging in some light conversation, nothing serious intended. Whether it involves Winslow or not, that&#39;s for you to unravel, isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re merely here for a bit of a chat.And, as you can see, we&#39;re under surveillance. So,perhaps we should leave things here for today. We&#39;ll take our leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group quickly stood, their heads down, and only slowed their pace once they were a good distance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, visibly upset, burst out, &#34;What are you so frightened of, Hackett? You could&#39;ve simply told Daniela it was Winslow earlier. What&#39;s the harm in that? Why push her to unravel on her own? What if she uncovers something that points back to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno mopped his brow, exasperated. &#34;Exactly. The car was right by the entrance, and yet we fled so far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marc grumbled, &#34;We&#39;re just painting targets on our backs at this point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett returned their worried looks with a piercing glare. &#34;What are you even talking about? There was surveillance there just now. If Daniela gets her hands on that footage and takes it to the police, then what?Do any of you have anything to defend yourselves</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the group once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the uneasy quiet, Huey asked, &#34;So, what&#39;s our next move? Do you think Daniela bought our story earlier? My company&#39;s teetering on the brink as it is.If this blows up any further, I might as well climb up to the top of the building and just jump.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s face contorted with frustration, a scowl etching deep into his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing his eyes, Hackett continued, &#34;Daniela&#39;s sharp. Whether she believes us or not, she&#39;s going to dig deeper. And when she does, she&#39;s bound to uncover Winslow&#39;s schemes. That should give us some room to breathe. Once Alexander gets back and kicks off another nationwide business offensive,it won&#39;t be so easy for Daniela to corner us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped the group once again, the gravity of their situation bearing down heavily on them. They hoped for a moment of respite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Daniela afforded them no such luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already taken each of them out, one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she didn&#39;t even have to try that hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their last encounter, it was painfully obvious-they were utterly outmatched by her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, boiling with fury, whipped around to face Hackett. &#34;You promised she&#39;d lay off for a while.Now what&#39;s our plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders, shut his eyes tightly, overcome by defeat.In a hoarse voice, he admitted, &#34;How was I to predict this? Daniela is merciless, beyond any possibility of negotiation! Why pin this on me? You just boasted about jumping from the building. Go on then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his harsh words, a genuine plea laced Hackett&#39;s tone, a faint hope clinging to the possibility that a drastic act could sway Daniela. He glanced sideways at Huey, noting the quick temper and restlessness that always seemed to simmer just beneath his surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a sinister thought slithered into Hackett&#39;s mind, stubborn and unshakeable. &#34;Huey,why not gather everyone for a meeting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the group assembled, each member&#39;s face shadowed by anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Positioned at the head of the table, Hackett projected a semblance of control, as though he still wielded his former clout as president of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat, he began, &#34;I have a proposition.It&#39;s still unpolished, yet I think it&#39;s worth discussing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining six members instantly snapped to attention at his words, their eyes igniting with a flicker of tentative hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey, barely able to hold back his eagerness,exclaimed, &#34;It&#39;s irrelevant if it&#39;s still unpolished. Out with it already! Are you really aiming to torture me wwith this unbearable suspense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett clenched his jaw, his hesitation artfully masked by a pretense of caution. &#34;Well, the plan is somewhat precarious. I fear it may spiral out of control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey threw his hands up in exasperation, his voice laced with frustration. &#34;Seriously, Hackett! Has Daniela intimidated you to such an extent that you&#39;ve completely lost your daring spirit? This isn&#39;t like you at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno glared at Hackett. &#34;Enough with the evasions.We need to hear it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley nodded. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s get to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face twisted with internal conflict as he reluctantly began, &#34;Alright, here&#39;s the raw truth. Elite Lux is swiftly ascending. It&#39;s painfully obvious that we stand no chance in a direct confrontation. If this trend persists, our downfall is inevitable. Huey&#39;s wild idea of jumping from the building... Well, that sparked a rather daring thought in my mind...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trailed off dramatically, letting the suspense build,his eyes scanning the room as realization slowly dawned upon each face.</p>
