                <p>Hamilton instructed his secretary, &#34;Get the car ready.I&#39;m going to see Daniela right now. Daniela and Cedric couldn&#39;t even protect their own child before.This time, I dare anyone to lay a finger on my grandchild.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some said the McCoy family carried a curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time after time, families in their circle hoped for boys, yet every new baby turned out to be a girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They watched other powerful clans celebrate sons while they swallowed their envy in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton&#39;s father lay dying, he lingered on,heart heavy with regret that he never saw a great-grandson carry the name forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His longing for a male heir ran so deep that he once vowed-the first great-grandson born to the McCoy family would inherit McCoy Group without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, that very promise made the child in Daniela&#39;s belly a target, sparking the explosion that stole the baby&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Daniela lost that child, the McCoy family tried everything but still failed to have a boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a shadow over them-no son, no matter how hard they prayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Daniela was carrying again, jealousy among the family was a given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton barked at his secretary to pack a truck with gifts and health tonics before climbing into the car himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton radiated pure resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While on the road to Daniela&#39;s place, he dialed the princess of Loglil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Your Highness. Forgive me, but Cedric won&#39;t be able to marry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess&#39;s voice turned soft and hurt.&#34;Why not?Does he dislike me? Or is Daniela holding him back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton forced a sorrowful sigh. &#34;No. Daniela knoWS she&#39;s not good enough for Cedric and agreed to step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to his own family, Hamilton protected them fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, he had no plan to accept Daniela and didn&#39;t care about ruining her name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now though, things had changed. With Daniela carrying his grandchild, Hamilton wouldn&#39;t let gossip tarnish her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a tone of heavy regret, Hamilton added, &#34;Daniela&#39;s always been reasonable. Just when they were about to finalize the divorce, she discovered she&#39;s pregnant. With a baby on the way, neither of them could bear to end it. So, Your Highness, I truly apologize. I&#39;ve spoken with your father too. He agrees-if a child is involved, Cedric doesn&#39;t deserve you.&#34; The princess refused to accept it and bit her lip.&#34;What if I&#39;m willing to accept the child too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Hamilton completely off guard. He hadn&#39;t imagined she liked Cedric enough to bend this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced a sigh and said, &#34;What a shame. Daniela only agreed to keep the baby on one condition-no divorce. The child should grow up with both parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked me to pass along his apology to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess&#39;s voice turned soft. &#34;So this is really what Cedric wants?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s chest tightened. She was royalty,yet here she was, being pushed aside because of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a breath and forced the words. &#34;Yes. This is Cedric&#39;s choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The princess whispered, &#34;Can I see him? I want to hear it from him myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, who had been listening, blinked so hard at Hamilton that his eyes nearly watered. Hamilton hesitated. &#34;Well...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t worry, Mr. McCoy. I just want to ask him about it. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton gave in with a tired nod. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary said nothing, though his face said plenty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary cleared his throat. &#34;Cedric will never let anyone insult his wife. If they meet, the truth will spill out fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shut his eyes for a second. &#34;Do you understand what I just did? I rejected a royal marriage. That stings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary looked at the deep lines on Hamilton&#39;s face, seeing how they trembled slightly.He could he not know? &#34;Sir, once you have a plump grandson in your arms, none of this will feel like a loss anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brows drew tight. &#34;We don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s a boy yet. And I&#39;ve already given up a princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary let out a low laugh. &#34;Trust me.Daniela&#39;s carrying a boy. Didn&#39;t you see it? Unlike the others, she brings good fortune wherever she goes.She&#39;ll bring blessings to your branch too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s spirit snapped back. His eyes lit up as he stared out the window. &#34;It has to be a chubby little boy!&#34;</p>
