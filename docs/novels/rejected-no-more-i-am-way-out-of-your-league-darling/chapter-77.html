                <p>After a protracted silence, just as Lillian believed Cedric was on the verge of leaving, he broke the quiet unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Alexander say? Do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian wished he hadn&#39;t asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of the topic seemed to ignite a fire within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed with anger as she erupted. &#34;That scumbag! Completely shameless! I&#39;ve never encountered someone so vile!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, maintaining a composed demeanor as he absorbed her tirade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had let off steam, Lillian elaborated, &#34;Alexander insists that if Daniela wants to break things off completely, she needs to hand over the North District renovation contract as a trade! Can you believe it?The contract with Tyler is already signed, construction has started! Daniela has devoted years of love to him,supported him through thick and thin, even ended her first marriage for him! And now, he demands this contract as the price for their separation? Are we just supposed to comply? Who does he think he is-a king?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hands tensed, opening and closing as he fought the urge to react more strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s pause, he asked in a level tone, &#34;Does she really want to cut ties with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian answered without hesitation, &#34;Absolutely! What&#39;s the point in prolonging this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quick response made Cedric pause, considering the potential impulsiveness of her answer. Gathering his thoughts, he proposed, &#34;Do me a favor. Check on that. If she truly wishes to end things with him, I&#39;ll handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked at him, bewildered. &#34;What are you suggesting? You mean to say you&#39;d let go of the North District contract? Cedric, I might not know every detail, but I do know the enormous effort you&#39;ve invested in that project. Over 500 design revisions! Are you really considering giving it up to Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Cedric stated resolutely. &#34;I won&#39;t hand it over. There&#39;s another way to handle this. Alexander is only after profit, right? I&#39;ve just secured a deal for a new international airline route. I&#39;ll offer that to him instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was visibly shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An international airline route was a major asset, a lucrative investment that could generate immense profits over decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s far too generous for Alexander!&#34; she protested, her voice tight with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric looked down at the calluses on his hands, his face composed, masking the storm of emotions within.In a steady voice, he affirmed, &#34;I believe it&#39;s worthit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was prepared to sacrifice anything to extricate Alexander from Daniela&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed the construction rights for the North District building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Articulating this, Cedric felt the full weight of his resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply wanted Daniela, the girl from his childhood memories, to have a joyful, serene life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He envisioned her living in a space he crafted, a place where her laughter would echo, free from any burdens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that dream, he was ready to relinquish anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Cedric&#39;s determined gaze, Lillian gave a resigned nod. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric had more instructions. &#34;Just find out if she truly wants to sever ties. If she does, I&#39;ll take care&#39; of the details. And don&#39;t let her know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked puzzled. &#34;You&#39;re going to all this trouble and you don&#39;t want her to know? What do you gain from this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dismissed her concerns wwith a wave and went back to the construction site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he stand to gain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Cedric, it was all about securing Daniela&#39;s happiness and peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was resolute, prepared to do whatever it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he headed back, his mind churned with anxiety. He was plagued by the fear that Daniela might not truly wish to cut ties, and the possibility that Alexander might reject the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary, riding alongside him, voiced his disbelief bitterly. &#34;Alexander won&#39;t turn this down. Do you realize the value of this deal? It could set the Bennett family up for generations! You&#39;ve invested so mnuch into this airline-think of the contacts you&#39;ve used, the countless meetings over drinks to secure it. And you&#39;re just going to give it away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes stayed glued to the landscape fleeting past the car window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the airline route was more than just a business venture. He had conceived it amidst learning of Daniela&#39;s divorce, even naming it &#34;Daniela Line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was intended for her-a way to offer escape and discovery if she ever felt adrift post-divorce.He dreamed of showing her the world, a gesture to help her shed her sorrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Daniela, Cedric had meticulously crafted countless plans for her, detailed and carefullylaid out, yet he had always hesitated to reveal them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t solely insecurity. It was also fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was so admirable, so impeccable, that he often felt unworthy of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric chuckled mirthlessly. In the presence of the woman he loved, he felt like a coward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned to his refuge at the construction site, immersing himself in work, all the while eagerly awaitng a response from Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Joyce had already arrived early at the hotel for the family dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting at the table, her anticipation radiating from her, she eagerly pulled out her phone and texted Alexander. &#34;Alexander, are you on your way yet?&#34;</p>
