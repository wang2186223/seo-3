                <p>Keith arched an eyebrow at Alexander, a teasing smile creeping onto his face. &#34;Daniela can&#39;t really play,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She can&#39;t,&#34; Alexander answered coolly, his voice steady but sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at his watch and adjusted it with careful precision. &#34;You know how these things go. Daniela&#39;s in charge of Elite Lux now, and everyone wants to get on her good side. She owns this concert hall as well, SO it&#39;s only natural that her people will be showering her with compliments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of disdain flickered in his eyes. Playing the cello wasn&#39;t something one could just fake. Without at least ten years of solid practice, what could she really be capable of? It would be a joke, plain and simple.This kind of mindless flattery was totally out of place for the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith laughed, clearly entertained by everything happening around him. He wasn&#39;t all that into the concert-he just loved the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Alexander, he asked, &#34;Looks like everyone&#39;s kissing upto Daniela these days. What about you,Alexander? Here to join in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing, Keith slapped Alexander on the shoulder.&#34;What&#39;s it like? The girl who used to run after you is now the one you&#39;re after. Must sting a little,huh? But hey, no judgment, man. We all do what we gotta do for money and power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face went cold, his jaw clenched as he shook off Keith&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His already icy expression grew even darker with Keith&#39;s blunt words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stepped onto the stage, Alexander&#39;s face stayed as cold as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people assumed this was a performance they&#39;d have to sit through just out of politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were quiet whispers as Daniela walked gracefully toward the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down in front of the cello, adjusting it with care. After testing the strings quickly, she began to play, no flashy introduction, just starting in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first note sounded-rich and full-cutting through the soft murmurs in the room, instantly quieting everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, which had just moments ago been filled with quiet doubt, now sat utterly silent. Every single eye was locked on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the soft glow of the stage lights, shesat with an air of elegance, her posture perfect and her hands moving with effortless grace. Her long hair gleamed in the spotlight, and her calm, serene expression gave her an almost otherworldly presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed like an angel who had descended from the heavens, exuding both peace and authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers danced over the strings, and the music flowed-deep, emotional, and hauntingly beautiful.The melody filled the hall, surrounding the audience and drawing them in completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall was utterly quiet, except for the sound of her cello.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience, spellbound, couldn&#39;t look away. All the whispers, doubts, and judgments faded. Nothing mattered now except the music and the woman behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this really be Daniela? The same woman they had dismissed as a shallow,love-struck fool?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last note dissolved into silence, Daniela rose from her chair, turned to the audience and offered a graceful,deep bow. &#34;It&#39;s been a while since I last played. I hope it wasn&#39;t too disappointing. Thank you all for listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall exploded into applause, so loud and intense that it caught her off guard for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a smile, her eyes softening with warmth. With elegance, she said, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith clapped so energetically that his hands turned red. He turned to Alexander, eyes wide with excitement and disbelief. &#34;Did you hear that? Daniela actually played the cello! And not just played it-she crushed it! Can you believe this? Alexander, how did you not know she was this talented? How could you have been such a clueless ex-husband?&#34;-	4</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s dark eyes stayed locked on the stage, his face betraying a mix of emotions he couldn&#39;t quite process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had genuinely never known this side of her. All this time, he had believed she was naive, obedient, and shallow-just another woman obsessed with status and appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the woman he had seen just moments ago was nothing like the person he had imagined. She had sat there with a quiet, commanding presence, her confidence shining through in every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really Daniela? The audience erupted into whispers that quickly grew louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first to speak were the young elites, their voices full of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoever called her a fool-come say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m in love with Daniela! I&#39;ll woo her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa, take it easy. What makes you think you&#39;ll be the only one? Let&#39;s be fair here. Everyone&#39;s in this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the general crowd couldn&#39;t hold back their chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, isn&#39;t that the CEO of Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her performance was amazing. I&#39;ve heard so many cello pieces, but this one spoke to my heart. It was perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I recorded the whole thing and posted it online just now. My notifications are exploding-hundreds of likes and comments already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of admiration and praise surged through the concert hall, sweeping over everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith turned to Alexander, still clapping excitedly &#34;Hey, Alexander, if you&#39;re not planning to win her back,I&#39;m stepping in. Daniela is too amazing to just let go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sat quietly, a growing irritation gnawing at him as he listened to the constant stream of praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he lifted his gaze. &#34;Amazing? I don&#39;t understand what all the excitement is about.&#34;</p>
