                <p>Lately, Nina had been working late into the night,hoping to cross paths with Cedric in Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Natalie mocked her for it, but soon enough,she found herself inventing reasons to stay late as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina couldn&#39;t hide her irritation at Natalie&#39;s sudden change of heart. With a sneer, she said, &#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who said if a man truly likes you, you don&#39;t have to chase him? That women who go after men are fools?So what now? You&#39;re playing a fool too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, calm and composed, remained seated at her desk,her eyes fixed on the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true-she&#39;d said those things before. But Cedric was different. His politeness was impenetrable,and he never seemed to notice her attempts. Frustration simmered inside her, and she realized she needed a new strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you see it? Cedric and Daniela had a fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina curled her lip, unimpressed. &#34;Of course,I noticed. t&#39;s hard to miss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Nina&#39;s tone, Natalie continued, &#34;Look, we&#39;re not enemies. I&#39;m not going to let Daniela take the lead.One of us deserves to rise above, and as sisters,we should support each other. Can&#39;t we deal with Daniela together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina paused, her mind turning over the offer. Then she said, &#34;I know what you and Mom are planning. I can work with you. Daniela&#39;s wealth means nothing to me.All I want is Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, Natalie cursed Nina for being so easily swayed.She smiled and said,&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shot her a suspicious glance. &#34;That was fast, even for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t it be? Men are a dime a dozen. Once you have wealth, you&#39;ll find plenty who are both handsome and obedient. You could easily land someone better than CCedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s doubt was evident in her eyes. Yet she held back, deciding not to argue. &#34;So, what&#39;s the plan?How do we make this work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin appeared on Natalie&#39;s lips. She motioned for Nina to come closer, and Nina leaned in without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere,Daniela wrapped up her work and prepared to leave. Cedric remained at his desk, lost in his own world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a week since Daniela&#39;s conversation with Cedric about making a decision. He still hadn&#39;t responded, and their interactions had become scarce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to monitor her meals three times a day,but once she finished eating, he would walk away without uttering a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Harper family villa had long since lost its appeal for him. Now, he seemed settled in the lounge at Elite Lux, as if planning to make it his long-term base.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed her laptop, her gaze drifting to Cedric,who sat absorbed in his work.&#34;Are we going to talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without lifting his eyes from the screen, Cedric replied,&#34;I&#39;m tied up today. Maybe later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, Cedric&#39;s schedule was packed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His ambition in the corporate world seemed boundless,and rumors swirled about the competitor who had pushed him so hard that there was no room left for retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s influence was growing swiftly, easing the worries of seasoned employees who had feared that a woman might distract Cedric from his relentless  drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighing, Daniela stood up. &#34;Alright. Don&#39;t stay up too late,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know how to approach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she excelled in business, when it came to personal connections, she felt completely out of her depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart longed for reconciliation, but Cedric was distant and unyielding. For the moment, she couldn&#39;t find a way through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to leave, a knock echoed on the door of the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina entered with a bright smile, her voice smooth as she spoke. &#34;Daniela, Mr. Bennett from Sunny Pharmaceuticals is hoping to have dinner with you to discuss a new round of cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name Mr. Bennett referred to none other than Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Alexander had made waves in the pharmaceutical industry, his sudden financial surge raising more than a few eyebrows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t see the need for dinner. Tell them to come to my office tomorrow,&#34; Daniela responded without a flicker of hesitation. Nina maintained her cheerful expression, adding,&#34;Understood, but he made it clear that this is a straightforward business collaboration. He hopes you won&#39;t let past issues cloud the bigger picture. If it&#39;s possible, he&#39;d prefer a more informal setting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina understood Daniela&#39;s stance well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business and personal matters never mixed in Daniela&#39;s world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina continued, &#34;Also, Misael Wayne will be attending.He&#39;s highly influential, and with his presence, they&#39;re confident the agreement can be wrapped up smoothly over dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Misael had long-standing business ties with Daniela.Recognizing his importance, Daniela knew she would have to honor his position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to give her consent, Cedric,who had been absorbed in his work, slowly raised his gaze.&#34;Weren&#39;t you going to talk to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken off guard, Daniela blinked. &#34;Now? You want to talk now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm, almost detached expression, Cedric shut his laptop. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her attention back to Nina. &#34;In that case, tell Mr. Wayne I&#39;ll meet them in my office  tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lip and didn&#39;t want to leave just yet. After a while, she managed a smile. &#34;All right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,Alexander&#39;s secretary waited patiently.Having pulled a few strings to ensure Misael&#39;s attendance,Alexander hoped for a dinner meeting that evening.He stood ready in a newly purchased suit, exuding confidence and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has another engagement tonight. Please return at eight tomorrow morning,&#34; Nina said to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander also appeared caught off guard. It didn&#39;t take long for him to accept the situation, knowing it wasn&#39;t entirely a surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always suspected that Daniela would be reluctant to accept a dinner invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, playing with a strand of her hair,flashed a coy smile. &#34;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea. Daniela was about to agree,but then Cedric asked to speak with her. So she decided to stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Alexander&#39;s expression darkened noticeably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle sigh escaped Nina as she continued, &#34;This happens often. She is deeply focused on her work, but Cedric gets possessive and needy. It&#39;s caused her a lot of trouble. But, of course,she will always protect those close to her, even at the expense of her own peace. We just have to hope Elite Lux won&#39;t suffer because of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let her words linger in the air before turning to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened further, a hint of bitterness creeping onto his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Cedric was nothing but trouble, and Daniela,still caught up in her own romantic fantasies, was only making things worse. Some aspects of her would never change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Alexander&#39;s mind, he alone had the power to break through her stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of frustration washed over him, and for a fleeting moment, he imagined storming upstairs to confront Daniela, to shake her out of her foolishness.</p>
