                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh. &#34;Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, this doesn&#39;t add up.&#34; Cedric rarely spoke so seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all their time together, he had always been gentle with Daniela-patient and considerate, never raising his voice, let alone challenging her like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, his expression was grave,his face stripped of its usual warmth or even a hint of a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although there was only a sofa separating them,Cedric suddenly felt as though Daniela was an ocean away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he realized he might not know her as well as he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re completely convinced that Katrina killed your mother. If you wanted to take action against her,there are countless ways you could&#39;ve ensured her death-or even made her suffer a fate worse than death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela listened quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was steady and deliberate as he  continued, &#34;But you never made a move. It wasn&#39;t out of fear-fear has never held you back. You&#39;ve always known that some things are worse than death, like a life filled with misery. You made sure Caiden saw who Katrina truly was, exposed her real self to Joyce,and let everyone witness her selfishness. You cut her off from everyone, leaving her utterly alone. You wouldn&#39;t have gone to such lengths just for her story to end so abruptly today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a soft, almost playful chuckle.&#34;But she&#39;s gone now, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The open window let the curtains dance in the breeze,giving the room an almost haunting atmosphere and making the figure near the doorway seem otherworldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric felt a sharp twinge of sorrow. &#34;Yes, Katrina is dead,but you don&#39;t seem surprised. You&#39;re not unsettled, and it&#39;s clear her death hasn&#39;t thrown off your plans. That can only mean you knew this was going to happen all along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched a brow, caught off guard by Cedric&#39;s perceptiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was more than just warmth in her gaze-there was a quiet admiration as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela explained, &#34;I didn&#39;t kill Katrina.&#34; Cedric responded without hesitation, &#34;I know. If you let Katrina die, it means there&#39;s a bigger plan at play.It has to tie back to the conspiracy surrounding your mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the carefully guarded layers of Daniela&#39;s secrets were stripped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a soft smile. &#34;Anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was steady as he asked, &#34;What do l mean to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hnad braced herself for a biting remark,expecting Cedric to unleash his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, his tone softened, losing its usual sharpness, as he asked quietly, &#34;Daniela, what am I to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile faded completely. She stood rooted in place, unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the stillness of the villa, bathed in harsh lights,Daniela could almost feel the vulnerability hiding beneath Cedric&#39;s usually impenetrable exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had laid his heart out for her to see. His voice,though soft, carried an edge of pain.&#34;I&#39;ve never tried to control what you do. You&#39;ve always known the only line I draw is your safety. I thought you understood that,but now I see you don&#39;t. You never value your  own life. Whether it was confronting Katrina on the rooftop, putting yourself at risk with the real culprit,or chasing after that man in black alone tonight-it&#39;s always the same. Daniela, I don&#39;t ask for much, but l need to know this. What do I mean to you, Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip, her hand at her side tightening into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to brush it off, like she always did, but this time, she couldn&#39;t bring herself to smile or pretend it didn&#39;t matter. Cedric&#39;s words were too heavy, too honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed silent, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, watching her, nodded slowly, as if the truth was already settling in. &#34;You won&#39;t even give me a fake answer now, will you? You&#39;ve always left me with a way out. That&#39;s why our relationship is a secret.When it&#39;s just us, you let me be with you however l want, but the moment anyone else is around, you keep me in the shadows. People think I&#39;m just some guy chasing after you. But is that what it is, Daniela?Are you so good at hiding your feelings for me, or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a shaky breath, his eyes dark with sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s heart clenched at the rawness in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the sharp, mocking edge in Cedric&#39;s tone. &#34;So,what am I to you? Am I just someone who can be discarded whenever you choose? Do you see me as your husband, or am I just someone you feel obligated to show affection to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words had been buried deep inside him,festering for too long. Cedric had told himself countless times that as long as Daniela stayed by his side, nothing else mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t want to talk about it, he wouldn&#39;t push.If she didn&#39;t want to go public with their relationship,he would quietly remain her hidden partner, happy to be in the background, seen as nothing more than a friend by everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it had ever bothered him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing Daniela continue to put herself in danger,he could no longer keep his feelings contained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the questions left his lips, he regretted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the villa stretched on, and Cedric&#39;s heartbeat thundered in his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was terrified of the answer he might hear. The thought that Daniela might end their relationship made his stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he felt her about to speak, panic hit him. For the first time ever, Cedric turned and ran, too scared to face what might come next.</p>
