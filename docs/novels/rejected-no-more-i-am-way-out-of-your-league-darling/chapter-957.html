                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;Authority over operations in the restructured McCoy Group won&#39;t be distributed. To clarify, Cedric alone will retain complete control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan&#39;s widened gaze, initially startled, gradually softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, that wasn&#39;t anything extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why even emphasize this detail?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Cedric&#39;s leadership ever questioned?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It was practically a guaranteed source of profit,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chewed on his lower lip. &#34;If I&#39;ve got funds, is it possible to contribute even more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed missing out on such a prime chance would be foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lara had once pointed out that early participation was straightforward, but after the business gained traction,additional involvement would prove challenging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan interjected, &#34;Brad, have you lost your mind?You&#39;re about to pour 28 billion into this, and that&#39;s insufficient? Are you not saving anything for Lara&#39;s future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad casually dismissed him with a gesture. &#34;This was Lara&#39;s own proposal.&#34; He intended to remain aligned with Daniela to ensure success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad asked Daniela, &#34;Would that be acceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;It is.&#34; She fully understood that regardless of Brad&#39;s efforts,his ownership could never exceed a fifth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. I&#39;ll pledge one villa along with fifteen real estate assets to the corporation. Using your estimates,with McCoy Group&#39;s accumulated value, my daughter helped calculate a ratio.&#34; Brad handed over a slip filled with numbers to Daniela. &#34;It equates to roughly 18 percent-just above 17 when precise.Could I receive a marginal increase in equity under this arrangement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scanned the paper and gave her consent. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,Daniela summoned a legal representative to prepare the paperwork, and Brad placed his signature at the topmost space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the signed agreement, Brad experienced a wave of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan eyed the official paperwork, a flicker of envy flashing across his face. &#34;You&#39;re placing that much faith in Daniela? Don&#39;t forget-she will settle scores with us eventually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad knew Ethan was referring to Daniela&#39;s mother&#39;s death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gingerly tucked the file inside his vehicle and addressed Ethan. &#34;Daniela once told me she&#39;d settle scores with us, but business is business. What do you think we work hard for? It&#39;s all for the sake of our families. Now that she&#39;s ensured a flourishing tomorrow for my family, I can finally breathe easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan murmured, &#34;Are you sure she&#39;ll actually make you wealthy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a firm nod. &#34;Lara said Daniela used Cedric&#39;s name to gain control of McCoy Group. So what&#39;s the risk? Cedric is her everything. She won&#39;t sabotage him to get back at anyone. This venture is destined to thrive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan stood motionless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, beneath the descending sun, his mind felt like a furnace of racing thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that juncture, he realized he had been the blind one all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any company launched under Cedric&#39;s banner, fortified by Daniela&#39;s influence, would inevitably succeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should Daniela have a son, then this business would serve as a gift offering from Cedric and Daniela as parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would she gamble recklessly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad returned for the evening meal, and as he stepped in,Ethan struck his thigh, jumped into his car, and accelerated away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad called after him, &#34;Ethan! Where are you headed?We&#39;re about to eat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan was trembling uncontrollably, convinced he had just uncovered the road to abundance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was rushing to Josh&#39;s residence to retrieve the money he had previously given away.</p>
