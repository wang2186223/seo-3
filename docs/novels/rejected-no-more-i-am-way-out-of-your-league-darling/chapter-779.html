                <p>Hamilton&#39;s hand struck Nikolas across the face again</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is what you&#39;ve learned from me after all these years? Pathetic,childish tricks! Nikolas, you&#39;ve become nothing but an embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas clenched his jaw. &#34;It&#39;s not my fault-it&#39;s Daniela. She&#39;s too cunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that your excuse? Why not just admit you&#39;re completely outmatched?&#34; Hamilton looked disgusted.&#34;She flipped your trap into an advantage. And you&#39;re still standing here, trying to defend yourself? If this is your idea of leadership, I fear McCoy Group will be doomed under your lead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas opened his mouth, ready to explain, but Hamilton had already lost patience and refused to listen to another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched helplessly as Hamilton headed to the building across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t alone. Behind him walked a team of design consultants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood by the entrance. Hamilton gave her a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>polite smile. &#34;Mind giving me a tour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Carol stepped in fast. &#34;The place isn&#39;t done. There&#39;s nothing to show you. Your games didn&#39;t work, so now you show up trying to act friendly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else had ever dared to speak to Hamilton like that. His face darkened. But he didn&#39;t snap. He kept his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still curious. How did Daniela manage all of this using just a domestic team? Frankly, he didn&#39;t buy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building looked incomplete to him. It didn&#39;t make sense. Hamilton gave a small nod toward the experts trailing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They understood and began moving through the site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let them roam freely while she kept her focus on the documents in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short inspection, Hamilton asked, &#34;What&#39;s your take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The experts traded looks. Then one spoke. &#34;Hard to say. It&#39;s too early. The structure&#39;s too bare. Without the design drafts, we can&#39;t make a real assessment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest nodded in agreement. Hamilton pressed his lips together and turned to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked thinner than usual. Fully absorbed in her work, she didn&#39;t even seem to notice them. She gave off the impression that their presence didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton glanced to the side and asked someone nearby,&#34;Where&#39;s Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pointed to an upper floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton looked up and saw Cedric standing near the stairwell, wearing a safety helmet, a white shirt,and dark trousers. He was giving clear instructions, calmly managing the crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His commands were sharp,his team assignments made sense, and he spoke with steady confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people around him followed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton watched in silence before walking over to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His shadow stretched across her desk. She glanced up,slightly curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you need something?&#34; Her voice was even, but there was a trace of interest in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton studied the scene. &#34;Not bad. It takes skill to coordinate a group like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pointed to Cedric. &#34;They&#39;re here because of him,not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton didn&#39;t buy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother to explain further</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured she was just trying to build up Cedric&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he returned daily. No experts followed him anymore. His hands were always behind his back,his steps unhurried. He didn&#39;t speak much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he was just curious-wondering what a man with a limp could really do. But the more he saw, the clearer it became. Cedric was a man who built his own future. He was clever, capable, and dependable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore button-down shirts or work gear, depending on the day. It didn&#39;t matter-he blended right in. But when it counted,he took charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Hamilton started to believe Daniela&#39;s words. The team wasn&#39;t here for her. They were here because of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Cedric one last look, then turned to Daniela.&#34;If you&#39;re free, come home for dinner.&#34; She looked up and gave a soft laugh. &#34;That offer came too late. When Cedric needed you, you weren&#39;t there. You see what he&#39;s become now. He&#39;s not the president of Phillips Group. He&#39;s not my husband. But that doesn&#39;t stop him from shining. He didn&#39;t need favors or shortcuts. He built himself from scratch. You don&#39;t need him, and truthfully, he doesn&#39;t need you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew-Hamilton wanted a decisive, ruthless heir. But that wasn&#39;t Cedric. Cedric wasn&#39;t cold or ruthless. He was full of warmth and feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;Didn&#39;t you once say you lost your memories? Strange, because the way you stand up for Cedric-it feels like you&#39;ve known him forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t hide it. &#34;When children don&#39;t get love from their parents, they&#39;ll always find someone who loves them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton went quiet for a moment. Then he said,&#34;Feelings are precious. But without money,they fade fast. You and Cedric are both capable. But no one ever minds having more. If you&#39;re willing to work with McCoy Group, I&#39;ll make sure you both have what you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her eyes. She chose not to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, someone like Hamilton would never understand what she truly meant-no matter how much she explained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Hamilton stood there thinking the same thing -Daniela didn&#39;t understand him at all</p>
