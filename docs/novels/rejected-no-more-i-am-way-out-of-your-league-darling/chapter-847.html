                <p>The new building was still without an elevator, so Daniela took her time climbing the stairs, her pace unhurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric strode ahead, shooting an impatient look over his shoulder. &#34;Pick up the pace, will you?&#34; he snapped at Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was sharp, causing Kohen to be momentarily stunned. He jolted, hurrying after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the group ascended, Damon stepped in front of Daniela, blocking her path with a quick hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She arched a brow, amusement flickering in her gaze.&#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon leaned in, his voice low. &#34;It&#39;s not safe up there.Maybe you should stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive flick, Daniela brushed off his concern. &#34;I&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t worry about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon hesitated, then fell into step behind her,unable to shake his unease. Halfway up, a sudden scream cut through the air, sharp and chilling. Damon&#39;s face tightened, dread twisting in his gut Without thinking, he broke into a run, fear for Cedric knotting his chest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the 15th floor, and Damon&#39;s breath caught in his throat at the sight before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood at the very edge of the unfinished floor,one hand clamped tightly around Kohen&#39;s neck,dangling him outside the unguarded railing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s body dangled in the open air, feet kicking helplessly,the city yawning beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face blanched, panic tightening every muscle in his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood frozen for a second, then shouted down the stairwell, his voice cracking, &#34;Daniela! Daniela-come quick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain Cedric had lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen,catching a glimpse of the barren construction site below-nothing but hard-packed earth, the promise of death in a single slip-tried to bluff his way out, his voice trembling. &#34;If I die here, this whole project goes under. You&#39;ll all be ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela appeared at the landing just then, her stride unhurried and her expression unreadable. &#34;It&#39;s only a project. If it costs your life, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a fair trade.&#34; She moved past the chaos, picked up a discarded piece of cardboard, and began to fan herself, acting as if she&#39;d wandered into a sunlit courtyard rather than a life-or-death standoff</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen sputtered, sweat streaking his face, realizing in that instant how powerless he truly was. &#34;You can&#39;t do this,&#34; he murmured, his hands shaking as he clung to Cedric&#39;s wrists</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning desperate, he called out, &#34;Damon, what are you waiting for? Get over here-help me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon took a halting step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move another inch and I&#39;ll drop him,&#34; Cedric remarked, his voice flat but dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a terrifying second, his grip loosened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t come any closer!&#34; Kohen wailed, his heart hammering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Damon swung around to Daniela,pleading, &#34;Please, I&#39;m begging you-no matter what happened, he&#39;s still my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned back on the railing,utterly at ease, the cardboard waving lazily in her hand. &#34;No one&#39;s dying today. This is just a warning. Go home and tell Hamilton-this is only the beginning.&#34; With that, she swept past Kohen without so much as a backward glance and disappeared down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment hung heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s gaze darted to Cedric, whose face was twisted with a rage that shattered his usual mask of detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, pure fear clawed at Kohen&#39;s chest-he was certain Cedric truly meant to kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You get one life, Kohen. One chance. If you ever pull something like this again, you&#39;re done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric shoved Kohen into a heap of debris and stalked away, never sparing him another look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence on the fifteenth floor was suffocating,stretching on long after Cedric&#39;s footsteps faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon hurried to Kohen&#39;s side and knelt down, his voice tight with concern. &#34;Kohen, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s hands shook uncontrollably, and even with Damon&#39;s help, he could barely steady himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally managed to stand, bitterness twisted his features. He swore through clenched teeth, &#34;I&#39;ll make them pay for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon just rolled his eyes as he huffed, &#34;Revenge? Look at you-you can barely stand. Don&#39;t kid yourself,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen. Just drop it and go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kohen&#39;s pride burned too hot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never been favored by his father, and now was his only chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Going home now would mean surrender, and he simply couldn&#39;t accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to inherit the McCoy fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he refused to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely acknowledged Kohen&#39;s existence-she had never intended to waste her time on someone so insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he trailed behind her all the way to the office,stubborn and unwelcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a sideways glance, her tone dripping with contempt. &#34;You&#39;re not scared out of your mind yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen forced himself to keep his voice steady &#34;You&#39;re mistaken about me. I&#39;ll prove myself.I swear,I have no hidden agenda where you&#39;re concerned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do whatever you want,&#34; Daniela replied evenly,already climbing the stairs without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all her reputation, Daniela was unexpectedly nonchalant,which only made Kohen&#39;s next task more daunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Explaining himself to Hamilton would be another ordeal entirely. He hadn&#39;t uncovered a single useful detail-only humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father wouldn&#39;t spare a shred of sympathy. He would only sneer, belittling him for coming up short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Hamilton&#39;s voice rang out with its usual steel,Kohen braced himself and answered, &#34;I brought Daniela to the construction site.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Hamilton&#39;s expression eased-a rare moment of satisfaction in weeks of disappointment. &#34;Does she have a fear of heights?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen swallowed hard. He hadn&#39;t a clue. Daniela hadn&#39;t even gone near the edge that day; she&#39;d stayed well inside, giving him nothing to report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, faced with Hamilton&#39;s expectations, Kohen had no choice but to scramble up an answer.</p>
