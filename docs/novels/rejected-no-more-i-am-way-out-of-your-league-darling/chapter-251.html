            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s aunt spat, &#34;Either live together peacefully or consider an early divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was stunned. Divorce? Joyce and Alexander had only just wedded, and already the possibility of divorce loomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors circulated among their friends that Alexander felt no attraction towards Joyce. He found her undesirable and had never been intimate with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Divorcing now would only validate the rumors that Joyce was difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking ahead, if Joyce wished to remarry or find a compatible partner, the prospects would be significantly tougher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, the Harper family&#39;s financial situation had deteriorated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed unlikely that Caiden would offer further support. Without financial means, a divorce would leave Joyce with nothing, potentially leading her to a mismatched marriage with a divorced man.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina considered her options carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she looked at Joyce, a brief moment of uncertainty passed between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joyce offered a small smile. She recognized the necessity of enduring the day&#39;s indignities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina then addressed the room. &#34;We are all family, and we should forgive and forget, but that does not excuse violence. Alexander, your actions were unacceptable, and I must express that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Alexander with a meaningful look. She meant to demand an apology from him to Joyce, but the words faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,she hesitated. &#34;Well, shall we leave it there for now? Joyce, take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she finished speaking than Richard and Alexander rose, disregarding Katrina entirely. As they headed out, Richard said to Joyce sharply, &#34;Aren&#39;t you coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce trembled, then turned her gaze to Katrina. Her eyes conveyed deep sadness and a silent plea for understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pain gripped Katrina&#39;s heart. She moved her lips as if to speak but instead turned away, resigning herself to silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce prepared to leave, she spoke icily. &#34;Mom, this is all on you! Everything bad happening is because of you! If you hadn&#39;t pushed me to sabotage Daniela&#39;s wedding, they wouldn&#39;t have split, and I wouldn&#39;t be trapped in this violent marriage. This is all because of your schemes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Joyce exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s head drooped, tears streaming down her face before she was overcome by sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent years manipulating events, never foreseeing such a tragic outcome for her daughter.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina went back to home, appearing visibly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spent several days confined to her bed, leaving Caiden to speculate about her demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, however, was indifferent. He was quite content. He filled his days with securing sponsorships and deals for Harper Group, making a modest income and enjoying social outings. His life continued pleasantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since neither Katrina nor Joyce viewed him as family, his efforts seemed pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless, he had the villa, and Daniela, showing compassion, had not evicted him. He believed she would arrange a proper funeral for him if he died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden never talked to Daniela about this, but he was very confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Caiden concluded that their familial connection was the reason Daniela would never abandon him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought, he felt at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times, glimpsing at Daniela reminded him of Brylee. Initially, Brylee had intimidated him, but now he was thankful to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was thankful for the capable daughter she had brought into his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After resting for three days, Katrina&#39;s resolve hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden continued to ignore her. She purchased many gifts and went to see Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning, her eyes swollen and red, Katrina retreated to her room for another day of rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela spent her days casually watching television, with Cedric keeping her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing them whispering together, Katrina turned to Shirley and advised, &#34;You can&#39;t just sit there idly. You need to learn how to attract a man&#39;s interest.&#34;</p>
