                <p>Doug&#39;s eyes roamed over Natalie, his look turning unpleasantly suggestive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie introduced herself with a smile. &#34;Good evening, Mr. Fairburne. I serve as the chief secretary at Elite Lux. My name is Natalie Dury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk crept onto Doug&#39;s face as he licked his lips.&#34;Really?&#34; Interest sparkled in his eyes. &#34;You&#39;re with Elite Lux? Impressive, especially for someone as young as you to be in such a senior role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s smile remained, cool yet distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s fascination grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fairburne, perhaps we could have a discussion in private?&#34; Natalie decided to be straightforward in her approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug&#39;s laughter was tinged with cunning.&#34;Absolutely! I couldn&#39;t possibly decline an offer from such a lovely lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a light, flowing gown, Natalie moved elegantly, throwing a tempting look over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug was thoroughly charmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to a secluded pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had they arrived than Doug tried to draw her close, wrapping his arm around her waist and leaning in for a kiss. Natalie deftly blocked him with her handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Fairburne, I was hoping for a genuine conversation. Why the rush to get physical?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Natalie&#39;s playful defiance only fueled Doug&#39;s desire even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew closer, his breath on Natalie&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smell wonderful. What did you want to discuss?We can talk just like this.&#34; In the dim garden light, Natalie moaned and held Doug&#39;s head, their gaze locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Daniela stood on the balcony with a wine glass in hand, her expression detached as she observed the scene below with a disdainful eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nina, Joyce has changed her outfit,&#34; Nina said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, bring her down,&#34; Daniela instructed calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina looked where Daniela was staring, noticing Doug&#39;s hand slipping inside Natalie&#39;s dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit early to send Joyce down?&#34; Nina asked, hesitating. &#34;Should we delay Joyce until they&#39;re finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;People always want what they can&#39;t have. Since Natalie is maintaining her distant demeanor, let&#39;s use that. Doug can look but not touch, heightening the tension for what comes next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina understood and nodded. Then, Daniela added, &#34;Have your media friend take pictures, but hold off on releasing them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina turned to look at Daniela with a start. She had not revealed to Daniela her plans to involve the media to tarnish Natalie&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, while it&#39;s wise not to show mercy to our enemies, we must also prevent them from striking back. Natalie isn&#39;t out of moves yet. Why rush?&#34;Daniela warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina remained quiet for a moment. &#34;Do you mean Linden?&#34; she finally asked. Linden had long harbored feelings for Natalie. If Natalie chose to get rid of Linden after securing Doug, Linden might well turn violent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were to happen, they wouldn&#39;t need to lift a finger. Others would be eager to remove Natalie from the equation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether through Linden or Joyce, their strategy would be merciless and calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina came to the harsh realization that her approach had been far too naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself drawn to Daniela&#39;s sharp intellect and undeniable cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina led Joyce, dressed in Elite Lux&#39;s finest, from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Doug was missing, Joyce narrowed her eyes and demanded, &#34;Where is my husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina gestured towards the dimly lit pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The muffled sounds of Doug and Natalie breathing heavily echoed from the secluded spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stern expression, Joyce approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found Natalie and Doug intimately entwined,sharing a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie! You brazen woman! How dare you seduce my husband!&#34; Joyce exploded, startling Natalie into stumbling out of Doug&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug, annoyed by the interruption, stood and straightened his attire. As he helped Natalie to herfeet, he told Joyce, &#34;What are you upset about?We&#39;ve both had our affairs for some time. I&#39;ve never meddled in your fling with Alexander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce clenched her jaw tightly. Doug had many women outside their marriage, but she was never bothered, knowing none of those women held a candle to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Natalie wasn&#39;t like the others. She carried ambition with her, setting her sights on becoming Doug&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both women could easily discern the other&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casual flings were tolerable, but a direct threat to her status as Doug&#39;s wife was not, only over her dead body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of fierce resolve swept over Joyce&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached Doug and kissed him in Natalie&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the scene, Doug&#39;s passion remained undiminished. He embraced Joyce, his breath ragged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a hushed tone, Joyce murmured into Doug&#39;s ear,&#34;Ask Natalie to leave! She&#39;s related to Daniela.Daniela won&#39;t approve, and it could complicate your relations with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doug momentarily froze, his actions halting. His gaze, still lustful, met Joyce&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce added, &#34;Hold off. Alexander is working on something bigger. Why settle for less when the genuine article is within reach? Natalie can&#39;t compare to Daniela,can she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Doug resumed holding Joyce tightly, their kiss resuming with renewed enthusiasm in the pavilion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s cheeks burned with both shame and fury,feeling completely degraded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced over, her smile smug as she caught Natalie&#39;s eye. Breathlessly, she mocked, &#34;Still here? Planning to watch us all evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a teasing smirk, Joyce turned back to Doug.He shot a glare at Natalie before snapping sharply, &#34;Get lost!&#34;</p>
