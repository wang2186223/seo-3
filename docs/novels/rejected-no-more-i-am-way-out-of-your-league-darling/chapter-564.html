                <p>&#34;Should I call a doctor for you?&#34; Alexander inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gestured for the waiter to open the window.As the crisp air flooded the room, she let out a slow breath. Bit by bit, the color returned to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander instinctively lifted his hand,ready to summon a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela dismissed the gesture with a wave. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. Just some digestive issues. Speak your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander studied her with a doubtful gaze. Could it really be just digestion problems? His voice carried concern. &#34;Have you at least consulted a doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, and oddly, that silence put Alexander at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, he had thought she was pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took a measured sip of water,her expression unreadable. &#34;You have ten minutes. Make them count.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message was unmistakable-she wasn&#39;t here for idle chatter. Alexander let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Only ten minutes?Come on, we&#39;ve known each other for years. Cedric won&#39;t get jealous over a simple conversation,will he?I mean no harm. Just thought we could talk set the past aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took another slow sip of water,her expression calm yet unreadable. &#34;I deal with countless matters every day and firmly believe in avoiding unnecessary conflicts unless someone gives me a reason to act. As long as you steer clear of those I care about, I&#39;ll have no reason to stand against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warning, clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander caught the message loud and clear but he pretended not to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled. &#34;We were close once, weren&#39;t we? If you&#39;re so protective, why haven&#39;t I ever been on that list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left his mouth, Daniela felt that same nauseating sensation stir again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I have no bad intentions. We both have a place in Olisvine, in the business world. Peace fosters success, don&#39;t you agree? We&#39;re both at the top. It makes more sense to trust each other than to waste energy on suspicion. I&#39;m offering an olive branch,nothing more. Why not stand together instead of apart?&#34; As he spoke, Alexander lifted his glass and tapped it lightly against Daniela&#39;s. &#34;The past is behind us, not worth dwelling on. Why not start fresh-as friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t move, her silence speaking volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips curled into a confident smile. &#34;As the newly appointed president of the commerce association, I now have control over 99% of businesses across the country. I understand that you have no interest in joining, and I won&#39;t pressure you.But you need to operate in this environment. Working with me means working smoothly with all these enterprises. Doesn&#39;t that make things easier for everyone? I don&#39;t know your reasons for going after those eight individuals, but if you intend to proceed,just say the word. You won&#39;t have to lift a finger-I&#39;ll handle them for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a dry scoff. &#34;Oh? I prefer taking care of things myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shook his head, a nostalgic smile tugging at his lips. &#34;Still as stubborn as ever, just like when we were kids. But now that I&#39;m the president of the association, any move I make against them is considered restructuring. However, if you take action,it will be seen as a failure on my part. Daniela,the last thing I want is to stand against you. I give you my word -within a year, those eight will be gone, and no one will even realize it happened. Just stay out of it, alright? If not for me, then at least for Chace. He&#39;s my friend now, and if this turns into a public mess,it won&#39;t be easy for him either, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chace Truman had been Brylee&#39;s friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brylee died, Chace oversaw the arrangements and hosted the funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had Chace step in as a mediator.Chace had said to Daniela, &#34;If your mother were watching over you,she&#39;d want you to be happy. If she knew her death was keeping you shackled, it would break her heart. A mother&#39;s only wish is for her child&#39;s happiness.You might not see it now, but one day, you will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Daniela had thought she wouldn&#39;t have to wait long. She&#39;d understand sooner than they realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Daniela said coolly. &#34;You have a month. If they&#39;re still standing after that, don&#39;t blame me for handling it my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes gleamed. &#34;Deal! Give me a month,and they&#39;ll be gone without a trace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela rose from her seat,ready to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sighed with mild regret. &#34;Had I known you weren&#39;t feeling well, I would&#39;ve rescheduled. My apologies. Once this is settled, I&#39;ll host a banquet-you have to be there.&#34; As Daniela stood, a gust of air carried the scent of steak towards her, making her wrinkle her nose in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction hit before she could suppress it.</p>
