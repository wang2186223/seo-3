                <p>As Josh expected, Brad, Jules and Ethan began to discuss how to get rid of Daniela&#39;s child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad remarked, &#34;Josh is already advanced in age,and Mason is disabled. For the moment, we should entrust Josh with McCoy Group and focus on dealing with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules nodded. &#34;I agree. Josh isn&#39;t likely to get far anyway, so giving him the reins for now won&#39;t hurt.I&#39;m on board!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added, &#34;Same here. He won&#39;t make waves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With everyone concurring, the arrangement was finalized: Josh would temporarily oversee all affairs concerning McCoy Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Josh obtained the official insignia of McCoy Group, a sinister smirk crept onto his face. That same afternoon, the primary investor associated with McCoy Group abruptly redirected their capital toward a mysterious corporation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, sipping on a glass of juice, observed the shift with silent calculation in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stepped into the space, gently draping a blanket over Daniela&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he adjusted it, she studied his expression and inquired, &#34;Who has authority over McCoy Group now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric secured the blanket, then responded, &#34;Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took another sip, murmuring, &#34;Josh, huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedricquestioned, &#34;Is something bothering you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nudged her laptop toward him. Cedric skimmed the screen briefly. &#34;Damn! Is he plotting to siphon off everything from McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pulled the device back and asked, &#34;Where do you suspect the redirected funds ended up?&#34; Cedric&#39;s demeanor hardened, jaw clenched. &#34;That sly devil! Want me to blow the whistle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could reply, a knock echoed from the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was already ajar, and Carol gestured from outside, addressing both Daniela and Cedric.&#34;The McCoy family is downstairs. They came bearing a pile of presents, claiming they&#39;re here to visit you,Daniela.Want me to send them packing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused briefly before answering, &#34;No need.I&#39;ll go and face them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the steps, Daniela spotted the McCoy family bossing Carol around, demanding beverages and śweets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol watched them coolly from the side, her face blank, her expression clearly unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; Brad barked, clearly irritated. &#34;What kind of behavior is that from a servant? Do you even know your place? One might think Daniela&#39;s staff lacks  etiquette.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules mocked, &#34;Exactly! Carrying yourself as if you own the place. Newsflash-you&#39;re a servant, nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan, mistaking Carol&#39;s silence for submission,jabbed a finger right in front of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before a word escaped his mouth, a sharp crack rang out. His finger had been snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze in disbelief as Ethan stared blankly at his twisted hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Ethan seemed paralyzed by shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, he howled-a shriek so loud it could split stone-raw pain filling every note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol retracted her hand, standing rigid, her stare frost-cold. Calmly, she stated, &#34;I don&#39;t tolerate orders. If you&#39;re looking to throw your weight around,I&#39;m not the one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family members stood rooted in place, thunderstruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad moved forward cautiously, lifting his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look from Carol made him recoil in terror. Still, he said stubbornly, &#34;You&#39;re just a lowly servant. How dare you lay a hand on us! Do you have any idea who we are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s face remained unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stiffened his spine, trying to maintain pride.&#34;We represent the McCoy family. We sit on the board of McCoy Group. We demand an apology-now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stayed put, the contempt in her smirk deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family bristled with rage but hesitated,wary of triggering Carol&#39;s fury again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, they resorted to yelling. &#34;Daniela! Daniela!Your servant&#39;s out of control! Come down before she tears us apart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela heard the uproar from the upper floor. She descended at a measured pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family looked relieved at the sound of her steps, but upon noticing Cedric by her side, his gaze like a blade, they fell mute.</p>
