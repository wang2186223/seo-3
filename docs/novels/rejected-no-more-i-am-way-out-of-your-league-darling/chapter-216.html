                <p>Cedric no longer bothered with the careful attitude he used to have around Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he stood up straight, looking serious but still showing some of the excitement from earlier. &#34;Daniela uses me to needle me? Alexander, you give yourself way too much credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked to Alexander&#39;s ribs. &#34;What? Back in shape already? Did you show up just to get hurt all over again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Alexander instinctively stepped back, his voice trembling. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re out of your mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t wrap his head around Cedric&#39;s obsession with Daniela. The man had given all his wealth to her.It was absolute lunacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Daniela really be worth such a wild leap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Alexander, the answer was crystal clear-she wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a moment later, his thoughts clouded with a subtle sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had lied to Cedric. Daniela hadn&#39;t seen him just now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t know when it had started, but somewhere along the line, he had become invisible to her-just another face in the crowd she no longer cared to recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d uttered a clumsy lie without understanding why he&#39;d even said it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it just because Cedric&#39;s presence grated on his nerves? Yes, that had to be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood motionless in the room. The health monitor on her wrist blinked unevenly, a silent echo of the tension filling the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander retreated to the empty garden and dialed Richard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure we don&#39;t need Marlin&#39;s help?&#34; Richard asked. &#34;Yes. Daniela has granted Cedric the chance to woo her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Richard asked, &#34;It&#39;s just a chance to pursue her. Why does he need her permission for that? If he wants to go after her, heshould just do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stared at the city lights far in the distance, his tone steady but laced with thought.-&#34;Do you really think anyone could approach Daniela if she didn&#39;t want them to? Since Elite Lux came into power, how many people have tried to win her over? And how many has she ever given the time of day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stayed quiet for a moment before finally asking, &#34;So, do you really think there&#39;s no point in asking Marlin to step in for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes wandered towards the faint outlines of the grassland in the fading light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt the urge to respond firmly,′′NO1, it&#39;s not necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But deep down, he wondered if saying that might mean he and Daniela would end up drifting apart, just like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s pause gave Richard the chance to chime in. &#34;Give it one last shot. Caiden&#39;s pushing for your marriage to Joyce, and with Elite Lux now aligned with Harper Group, their future looks promising.People are already asking Katrina about Joyce. In our world, alliances and gains always take priority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a composed tone, Alexander replied, &#34;Fine. Make the arrangements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marlin wasted no time and showed up at Daniela&#39;s office the following day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was tending to a plant in Daniela&#39;s office, having sent Huntley off on an errand earlier that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked visibly pleased with himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marlin stopped in his tracks when his eyes landed on Cedric, surprise flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips? What brings you here?&#34; Marlin asked, visibly stunned. Could Cedric and Daniela be in a relationship?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that were the case, speaking up would be a challenge. Besides, next to Cedric, Alexander didn&#39;t even come close to matching his stature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric recognized Marlin immediately; he was a man held in high regard. He flashed a polite smile and declared, &#34;I&#39;m here because I&#39;m courting Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, feeling invincible, was bursting with pride, ready to tell anyone and everyone that he was pursuing Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, courting someone wouldn&#39;t warrant such a grand proclamation, but Cedric&#39;s enthusiasm made it sound like he&#39;d already swept Daniela off her feet and they were preparing for their wedding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...courting,&#34; Marlin echoed thoughtfully, glancing at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a smile and asked, &#34;Marlin, was there something you wanted to talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could respond, Cedric passed Daniela a glass of water and reminded her, &#34;You haven&#39;t had anything to drink this morning. Take a sip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod, took a sip from the glass, and then turned her gaze to Marlin.11|sthere something you want to talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marlin suddenly felt out of place. The way Daniela and Cedric interacted didn&#39;t feel like casual courting-it carried the ease and understanding of two people already in a relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marlin found himself at a loss for words. After sipping his water and forcing a polite smile, he decided to get straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Bennett family asked me to pass along a message,&#34; Marlin began.&#34;Alexander would like a chance to pursue you, Daniela. What&#39;s your opinion on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s grin disappeared in an instant. It was as if the whole universe had set its sights on the woman he held dear.	J</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Marlin finished, he could feel the icy intensity of Cedric&#39;s glare. It was uncomfortable, especially for someone his age, as he&#39;d rarely been in such an awkward position before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an uneasy laugh, he stood and said, &#34;Well, I&#39;ve done my part. The decision is yours. My apologies for the sudden visit today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying no more, Marlin hurriedly left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at the closed door for a brief moment, her expression unreadable, before glancing at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there holding the plant, his gaze downcast as if deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander regrets it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had always known it would come to this. He&#39;d seen it on the horizon long before now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was filled with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wasn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t have swallowed his pride and had Marlin act as his messenger.</p>
