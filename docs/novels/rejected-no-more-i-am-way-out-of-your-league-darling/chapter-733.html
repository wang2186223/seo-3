                <p>Cedric was momentarily paralyzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts ceased to function, leaving him in a numbing void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just five minutes later, under the weight of Joyce&#39;s sympathetic look, he rushed upstairs and flung open Daniela&#39;s room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was impeccably tidy, preserved just as Daniela had left it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Cedric, this neatness suggested that Daniela might still return, casting doubt on Joyce&#39;s claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved quickly to the safe and unlocked it. Inside,all the crucial documents were, intact, except for Daniela&#39;s identification and personal documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had come up behind him. &#34;Daniela has signed everything here. She&#39;s transferred all her domestic companies, including Elite Lux, to you.&#34; Cedric remained motionless, his back rigid as he faced away from her. Joyce watched him silently for a few moments before extending a document toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the divorce agreement. Daniela has already signed it. You just need to sign it. Once that&#39;s done,your marriage is officially over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce could see Cedric&#39;s frame shudder slightly as the reality of her words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Despite everything, she was good to you,&#34; Joyce said, her voice low and soothing. &#34;She left you this villa too. It belonged to her mother. Daniela would return here whenever things with Caiden turned sour.This place was the last piece of her mother she had,and now, it belongs to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had run the numbers on what she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assets from Elite Lux alone totaled more than ten billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone positioned Cedric among the global elite in terms of wealth. Their marriage had lasted only three years, during which they had spent much time apart, and Daniela had even suffered from amnesia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering these circumstances, her generosity was nothing short of remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Financially, marrying Daniela had proven a windfall for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was about to continue when Cedric interrupted her. &#34;Did she leave any message for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Joyce paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, Cedric&#39;s interests had never centered on wealth or property; his heart had always been with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trembled as he asked, &#34;Did she say anything when she left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt a wave of empathy wash over her. After a brief silence, she replied, &#34;She asked me to tell you to take care of yourself. She hopes you find the right person. She said you&#39;re a good man, and that you both just weren&#39;t meant to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words cast a deep silence over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce noticed Cedric&#39;s shoulders began to tremble,followed by his mocking laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t say anything at all, did she? You are lying to me. She didn&#39;t leave any message, just this divorce agreement...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was at a loss for words. Cedric had guessed it right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep sigh, Joyce said, &#34;Both of you are t00intelligent for your own good. She didn&#39;t need to spell everything out. The villa she left you-that was her final message. She&#39;s not coming back. No matter how much you hold on, it won&#39;t bring her back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce felt that Daniela had been exceptionally harsh this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been strict with others, and even stricter with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying her piece, Joyce silently withdrew from the room, leaving Cedric alone with his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, on the airplane, Carol kept glancing over at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they climbed higher, the city below seemed to fade away into nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, we&#39;ve left the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed out the airplane window, the view obscured by dense clouds. She acknowledged Carol&#39;s comment with a simple &#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol paused, her voice tinged with concern. &#34;Is it fair to leave things unresolved like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his seat behind them, Charles studied Daniela&#39;s profile intently, pondering her feelings for Cedric. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder whether she loved Cedric or not. Probably not. Otherwise, how could she leave him like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t love Cedric, perhaps...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles&#39; gaze lingered on Daniela&#39;s face, illuminated by the soft light that painted her with an aura of kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought crossed his mind momentarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Daniela...&#34; but stopped as Daniela turned to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her piercing, cold stare halted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His romantic musings dissipated instantly, like a bubble vanishing into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles was struck by the realization that Daniela was not the tender soul he imagined. Her cool,penetrating eyes suggested an unsettling depth, as if she could see right through someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The discomfort was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hastily regained composure and chose silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had predicted Cedric would crumble after Daniela&#39;s departure. Yet, the expected breakdown never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, after spending a mere thirty minutes alone upstairs, he headed straight for the airport to where Daniela&#39;s plane was scheduled to leave. There, he stood in solitary vigil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained there until dawn crept across the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing from afar the entire time, Joyce captured a poignant image of his solitary figure with her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to his assistant beside her, she asked,&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to say something to him? He&#39;s been immobile for over ten hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric appeared as unmoving as a sculpture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, the assistant replied, &#34;Life&#39;s thrown many challenges at Mr. Phillips. Yet, his marriage seemed the one constant. Perhaps this separation is their way of discovering what truly matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, taken aback, questioned, &#34;Cedric hasn&#39;t figured that out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant exhaled deeply. &#34;He&#39;s certain of his own feelings. The real uncertainty lies with her. Does she feel the same?&#34;</p>
