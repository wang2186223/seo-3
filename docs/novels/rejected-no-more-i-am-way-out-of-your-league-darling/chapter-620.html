                <p>Caiden&#39;s curses echoed from downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,within the building, his outbursts seemed to bother no one anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce turned to observe the occupants, her expression one of confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer to Caiden and asked, &#34;Dad, doesn&#39;t something seem strange here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated with his legs crossed, Caiden awaited the arrival of the building&#39;s buyer. &#34;W/hat seems strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The security guards are not acting like their usual timid selves. Look, they&#39;re even singing! For the past three years, they&#39;ve been nothing but subdued-heads down, shoulders hunched, never talking back. But today, they seem unusually relaxed. It&#39;s strange!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing towards the guards, Caiden was surprised to see the security captain, who was always so serious,now wearing a wide grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you ask about it, Dad? The buyer is coming this afternoon, and we can&#39;t have any disruptions.&#34; Acknowledging her point, Caiden strode towards the security captain and called out dismissively,&#34;Hey,you there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The captain turned his head and cast a glance in his direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden motioned toward him and called out,&#34;Yes,you.I&#39;m talking to you. Come over here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The captain strode forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Caiden saw the captain approaching with that smug attitude, a surge of anger flared up inside him. He had never once dared to behave this boldly before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on at Elite Lux today?&#34; Caiden asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Caiden continued, &#34;You seem awfully pleased with yourself. I&#39;ve told you we&#39;re bringing media and a buyer later. Doesn&#39;t that concern you?You all wanted to stay even without pay. What? Aren&#39;t you worried I might fire you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, the captain had every intention of forcing Caiden to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela pointed out that since they were already bringing in the media, the timing couldn&#39;t be better. It spared Elite Lux the trouble of organizing a press conference on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until then, there had been no reason to inform Caiden that Daniela was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would let Caiden enjoy his arrogance a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would also give everyone a clear look at just how desperate he was to get his hands on his daughter&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shot a furious glare at the captain. &#34;Say something! What game are you playing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The captain shrugged, his expression one of resignation. &#34;What can I say? You&#39;re selling the building. I&#39;m just a security guard. There&#39;s nothing I can do about it. Being happy or not doesn&#39;t change anything, so I choose to be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden laughed and responded, &#34;That&#39;s a wise approach!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disdain flickered in Caiden&#39;s eyes as he instructed,&#34;Inform everyone inside that as of tomorrow, this place will no longer be known as Elite Lux. Don&#39;t bother showing up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The captain smirked, watching Caiden&#39;s departing figure. &#34;It&#39;s simple,&#34; said Caiden, returning to Joyce. &#34;They&#39;ve accepted the situation. Once the buyer finalizes the deal,we&#39;ll quickly secure the money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce agreed. &#34;Yes, we might have to accept a lower price, but we need to sell it quickly. Cedric isn&#39;t someone we can easily handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden scoffed at her remark. &#34;No matter Cedric&#39;s capabilities, would he really dare to claim Daniela&#39;s assets? Daniela is my daughter, and what&#39;s hers is mine.Besides, Elite Lux was her property before marriage, so it naturally belongs to me. Cedric has no stake in it.Unless Daniela is somehow alive, everything at Elite Lux belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce smiled slyly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could Daniela be alive? The explosion was sO severe that not a trace of her was found, just a piece of her clothing left in her grave. The idea of her being alive is ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s tone took on a mocking edge. &#34;Daniela&#39;s two followers didn&#39;t survive the blast either. Cedric only escaped because a bodyguard miraculously saved him.He was incredibly fortunate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sighed, a note of regret in his voice. &#34;If only Cedric had met the same fate. Then every last bit of Daniela&#39;s fortune and Phillips Group&#39;s assets would have been mine without question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce laughed at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of the captain&#39;s smug expression crossed Caiden&#39;s mind, stirring a flickerof unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fell silent, and when Joyce looked at him doubtfully, he murmured, &#34;Daniela is definitely dead,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chuckled. &#34;Yes, of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden&#39;s words lingered in the air, his unease deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The haunting memory of the mental institution&#39;s decayed corridors remained etched in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the unknown benefactor who had unlocked the door that night, providing his escape.A return to that place was something he vowed to avoid at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he considered himself fearless, the ordeal at the institution had instilled a profound fear of Daniela within him, a fear that penetrated his bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clung to the hope that Daniela was indeed gone,utterly destroyed in that explosion with no possibility of survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Caiden&#39;s ashen complexion, Joyce attempted to calm him. &#34;Relax, the entire world believes Daniela is dead. If she were alive, would Elite Lux be in such disarray? You&#39;re worrying unnecessarily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a more subdued tone, Caiden expressed his fears.&#34;I truly hope I&#39;m just being paranoid. Regardless,this afternoon, we need to finalize the sale of Elite Lux,whatever the cost, and secure the funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce offered reassurance. &#34;There&#39;s no need for concern. The buyer is both influential and dependable.He hesitated initially, fearing Daniela might still be alive, hence his inaction. Now, convinced of her demise after three years, he&#39;s made his move and reached out to me.&#34;</p>
