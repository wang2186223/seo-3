                <p>Natalie jerked her hand free from Elyse&#39;s tight grip.&#34;Go ahead and leave if you must, but I&#39;m holding on to Daniela, my source of wealth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, if capturing Cedric&#39;s heart was beyond her reach, surely she could sway Cormac? Despite Nina&#39;s interference, she refused to concede defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nina came back, Cedric was in the kitchen,meticulously preparing fruit for Daniela, who was comfortably nestled on the couch, her eyes glued to the television screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Head bowed, Nina quietly stepped in, casting a fleeting glance at Daniela before stopping at the kitchen entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, my mother and Natalie caused a scene today. I&#39;m sorry for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric kept his attention on the task at hand.The kitchen was engulfed in a deep silence, broken only by the rhythmic sound of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina observed Cedric as he washed the cherries and arranged them in a basket, then turned the faucet off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The abrupt silence left nothing but an icy stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s discomfort grew, a nagging unease that had followed her on her journey back. She dreaded becoming a burden to those around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she tangled with her anxieties, Cedric&#39;s voice,low and soothing, cut through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela sees you as family. Her childhood was filled with hardships, and though she might appear reserved, she genuinely enjoys the warmth of company. She doesn&#39;t regard you as an inconvenience. I hope you can find joy here, as part of our family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to Nina, his expression softening.&#34;You know, since we&#39;re all family here, causing chaos isn&#39;t a concern,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried the casual ease of a simple truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for her response; instead,he walked over to Daniela, presenting her with the fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina watched him go, a surge of emotions swelling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be considered part of the family-this was a novel and heartwarming experience for her.She had never before felt such a profound sense of belonging and affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, within the walls of Daniela&#39;s home, it was taking place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had previously given Alexander a month to deal with the eight members of the commerce association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, she hadn&#39;t paid attention, just waiting to see the results in a month. However, Alexander would send updates. While Daniela was watching TV, she received a message from Alexander. &#34;Quick update-Winslow has stepped down from the association; that leaves seven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused, the name &#34;Winslow&#34; sparking a faint memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once approached her, offering a large sum of money, an action she had barely acknowledged at the time. Now, his name resonated with newfound significance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next two weeks, Daniela heard nothing from Alexander, a clear sign that matters were deteriorating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela did some investigating herself. Previously,during the acquisition, several people had been dealt with. Now that she had stepped back, they were eager to make a comeback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan presented the latest market shares to Daniela,highlighting that Bennett Group&#39;s progress had stalled since aligning with the association. Lillian, ever practical, remarked, &#34;It&#39;s to be expected.Those seven individuals are tight-knit. Alexander stands little chance against their united front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fool!&#34; Daniela responded with a dismissive sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian continued, &#34;Winslow&#39;s reaction is peculiar,though. He sensed the adverse tides and promptly backed out. I hear he&#39;s even prepping his immigration papers. Didn&#39;t he claim to be uninvolved? Why the sudden rush to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s tone was nonchalant as she spoke, but the news visibly surprised Daniela, and Lillian caught the shift in her demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shared a knowing look, silent yet potent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a piercing gaze, Daniela commanded, &#34;Dig into this. If needed, press Caiden or Elyse for details about this man&#39;s involvement in my mother&#39;s death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian wasted no time and sought out Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Lillian&#39;s stern stare, Elyse shivered,confessing, &#34;Winslow was a latecomer to the association. I hadn&#39;t much dealings with him. He&#39;s always so introspective and reserved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression turned colder. &#34;Had Daniela&#39;s mother ever mentioned him before she died?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse shook her head. &#34;No, never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian tucked her dagger away and made to depart.Elyse followed her. &#34;Lillian, considering that the nation&#39;s foremost entertainment enterprise bears Daniela&#39;s name, could you possibly unearth some resources for Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian cast a sidelong glance at Elyse, whose smile was tinged with hope. &#34;You should speak to Cedric about that. He&#39;s entitled to all of Daniela&#39;s assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Daniela consent to that?&#34; Elyse pressed, her voice tinged with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian replied curtly, &#34;Indeed,she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Elyse was momentarily at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to converse with Daniela, Lillian relayed Elyse&#39;s response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t even mention Winslow?&#34; Daniela&#39;s voice trailed off into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What troubles you, Daniela?&#34; Lillian inquired, noting her distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated, her tone reflective. &#34;I can&#39;t quite articulate the feeling. It&#39;s unsettling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Persisting, Lillian added, &#34;Caiden mentioned he would remain silent unless you visit him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slow nod. &#34;I&#39;ll pay him a visit this evening.Please fetch Linden for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian observed Daniela closely. &#34;Are you concerned that Nina lacks the strength to manage Natalie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela exhaled sharply. &#34;Nina&#39;s approach is too mild. I doubt she&#39;ll be able to handle it properly.Luckily, with Linden there, Natalie won&#39;t get the chance to make a mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chuckling, Lillian exited to call Linden. Upon Linden&#39;s arrival, Daniela instructed, &#34;I need you to take care of Nina on the set. What are your thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linden, quick to grasp the underlying implication,assured her confidently, &#34;You can count on me.I won&#39;t disappoint you.&#34;</p>
