                <p>Nikolas was livid, his jaw tightening as he ground his teeth in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Richard shot him a calming glance. Nikolas forced a crooked smile and muttered, &#34;Alright, let&#39;s eat first,then we&#39;ll talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas waved the waiter over to begin serving the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the table was piled high with an array of dishes. With a broad grin, Nikolas turned to Daniela and said,&#34;Come on, Daniela, give it a try. It is the signature dish in the restaurant. Cedric, you too. And Carol, don&#39;t just sit there, dig in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was brimming with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol reached for her fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she was about to take a bite, Daniela reached out and stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol paused, tilting her head in confusion, her eyes drifting to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze remained calm as she looked at Carol. Turning to Nikolas and Richard, she said, &#34;If there&#39;s something you wish to say, just say it. We came straight from home, and we already ate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard clenched his teeth tightly, barely containing his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;ve already eaten, a little more won&#39;t hurt,&#34; Nikolas said, gesturing toward the beef Carol had been eyeing. &#34;Carol, don&#39;t mind Daniela. The beef here is unbelievably tender!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a mocking laugh, her smile laced with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slowly turned her gaze from Carol to Nikolas, then gestured at the dishes in front of her. &#34;Why don&#39;t you eat first?&#34; Nikolas froze. Earlier, he and Richard had slipped something into the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas chuckled dryly. But he&#39;d expected Daniela to be wary, so he didn&#39;t lace every dish. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, you&#39;re way too suspicious. We&#39;re family, aren&#39;t we? Are you really accusing me of poisoning the food? You&#39;re hilarious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Nikolas picked up a slice of cucumber and crunched into it, smiling with exaggerated satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he set his fork down, Daniela asked casually, &#34;Is that all you&#39;re going to have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas had never encountered anyone as difficult as Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth behind his smile and reached for some vegetables.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela lowered her gaze, then looked over at Richard. &#34;Aren&#39;t you going to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard gave a light chuckle, obediently picked a fork, and took a slice of radish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, satisfied, and picked up her fork. With Nikolas and Richard watching her closely, she added some greens to her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said, &#34;Come on, Daniela,have some meat!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded a little too eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could make another move, Daniela dropped a piece of beef onto Nikolas&#39; plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I remember you like it too. Go ahead,&#34; Daniela urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere suddenly intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at the beef before him, a chill creeping over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! What&#39;s the meaning of this? I invited you for a meal, but that&#39;s what you are trying to do?&#34; Nikolas was so enraged that veins popped on his forehead, his face flushing red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean nothing,&#34; Daniela replied with a slight smile. &#34;What? Is the beef inedible? Or why else would you be so upset?&#34; Nikolas clenched his jaw again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met his gaze and asked, &#34;So, is this beef edible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had backed Nikolas into a corner. If he didn&#39;t eat the beef, he&#39;d look guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if he did...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a laxative in that dish, and if he dared to eat more than a few bites, he&#39;d be stuck in the bathroom all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas took a deep breath, annoyed and relieved at the same time. Well, at least it was just a laxative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas forced himself to eat the beef.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked and turned to Richard, who calmly followed suit, taking a bite of beef as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas,struggling to keep his cool, cleared his throat. &#34;Alright, Daniela, we&#39;ve eaten. Now you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded with a smile. &#34;Of course we&#39;ll eat it! You&#39;ve been such a generous host, and we wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was overjoyed. Fortunately, he had secretly brought antidiarrheal pills with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt lucky to have come prepared. Otherwise, Daniela would&#39;ve outsmarted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, feel free to eat whatever you like,&#34; Nikolas said before stepping out to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kohen, everything&#39;s going smoothly. Once the laxative kicks in, we&#39;ll move them to the rooftop and toss them off. We&#39;ll say they jumped off the building.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, they wouldn&#39;t arouse any suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen replied, &#34;Okay. In thirty minutes, Charles and I will storm in with a team. Cedric and Daniela must die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes, a grin tugging at his lips. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing his call, Nikolas returned to the room, feeling quite pleased with himself. But the moment he stepped inside, he noticed Richard&#39;s grim face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at the table and noticed a few new dishes while the food that he had ordered had been pushed to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol was digging into a plate of stir-fried lobster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t playing by the usual rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas demanded, &#34;What do you mean, Daniela? Do you think the dishes I ordered aren&#39;t good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said calmly, &#34;How could it be? Carol likes spicy food, so l ordered some. We can still talk now. You can tell me what you&#39;re planning to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was furious. He could barely resist the urge to throw Daniela and Cedric off the building.</p>
