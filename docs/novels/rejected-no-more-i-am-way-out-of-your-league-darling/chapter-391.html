                <p>With a satisfied smile, Nina exited, leaving Natalie frozen in place. Her eyes lingered through the door,fixed on Daniela in the CEO&#39;s office, a sneer curling her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving for a meeting, Cedric had kissed Daniela on the forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie turned to Daniela, her voice dripping with mockery. &#34;I must say, I envy the bond you have with Cedric. Not many men are like him. Even when you insist it&#39;s just about the physical,he still stays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the subtle challenge in Natalie&#39;s words,Daniela chose silence, waiting for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie paused for a few moments, waiting for a response from Daniela.When none came,she smirked and let out a chuckle. &#34;Daniela, I just overheard Cedric planning to meet Nina this weekend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained emotionless. When it came to attraction, she was completely sure of herself. She trusted in her appearance and Cedric&#39;s loyalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt a twinge of disappointment, unable to  sense any emotion from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Daniela truly not care about Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in slightly, Natalie couldn&#39;t resist pressing further. &#34;Aren&#39;t you curious about what they&#39;ll be up to this weekend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited, the silence thick between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze remained locked on the project proposal on her screen, completely ignoring Natalie&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no flicker of concern for Cedric in her expression either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie clenched her jaw in quiet frustration, lowering her eyes as she made her way out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hallway, she called her mother. &#34;Mom, stop trying. I&#39;ve tested her again and again. Daniela doesn&#39;t care about Cedric. If you want to hit her where it hurts,you&#39;ll have to dig into her personal affairs. Cedric won&#39;t work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice crackled with doubt through the phone.&#34;Are you sure? Nina mentioned things were heating up between them. Cedric is Daniela&#39;s weakness, her Achilles&#39; heel. Do you really think you&#39;ve got it right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, do you not trust me?&#34; Natalie&#39;s tonewas tinged with impatience. &#34;I told you, they only have a physical  connection. If she truly cared, she&#39;d be worried about him meeting someone else. Daniela doesn&#39;t care for Cedric at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Elyse exhaled sharply, her voice laced with concern. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;re in trouble.Without a weakness like Cedric, we&#39;ll have to go after herself to get to her assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she spoke with resolve, unease lingered in Elyse&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, she made her decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small gift in hand, she stepped into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile played on her lips as she said, &#34;Daniela, you know, Nina&#39;s getting older. It&#39;s time she thought about marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Elyse spoke, Daniela knew exactly what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even lifting her gaze, she responded casually,&#34;Oh? Do you have someone in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Of course. Nina&#39;s particular,you see. After all this time working as your secretary, she&#39;s taken a liking to one of the men over at Elite Lux. But she&#39;s worried you won&#39;t approve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s lips. &#34;Surely you&#39;re joking. The employees at Elite Lux are free to make their own choices when it comes to marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse took a slow sip of her coffee, her laughter gentle but knowing. &#34;This one&#39;s a bit different, though.Your approval is important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, still engrossed in her work, gave a brief nod.&#34;I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Elyse dropped the name. &#34;Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric?&#34; Daniela&#39;s pen hovered over the contract as she glanced down, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Cedric. I&#39;m here to ask if what you have with him is serious, or just a passing fling. If it&#39;s the latter, I think it would be best to let Nina and Cedric have their chance together.&#34; A knowing smile crept onto Elyse&#39;s face. &#34;Cedric has a lot of potential. If he were to marry into the Dury family, he&#39;d be quite the asset in the future,wouldn&#39;t you agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse was certain her question would make Daniela hesitant, expecting some vague or unclear answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve slept with Cedric,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
