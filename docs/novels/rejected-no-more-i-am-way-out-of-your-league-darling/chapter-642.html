                <p>Daniela was immersed in her reports when the door abruptly swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight before her was jarring-a man drenched in blood,his once-refined suit now a chilling mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stiffened, her gaze locking onto Cedric, the dim office lights casting eerie shadows over his blood -streaked form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric said nothing, his silence stretching into something heavy,almost suffocating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsettled,Daniela frowned. &#34;What happened?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flickered to the clock-past one in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood had dried into dark patches on Cedric&#39;s suit and shirt, even staining the fine arch of his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose instinctively, but before she could move,Cedric was already closing the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A limp in his stride betrayed an injury, yet he moved with urgent determination. Before Daniela could utter a word</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a firm ombrace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was taken aback. &#34;Cedric, what happened</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric held on to his silence, his grip tightening around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressed against his chest, Daniela could hear the steady, powerful thrum of his heartbeat. Each beat echoed through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Cedric. What&#39;s going on?&#34; she pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Cedric felt like a storm barely contained within a man&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way the blood clung to him, it was as if he had just killed someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease gnawed at Daniela. She hesitated,then gently patted his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His erratic heartbeat, once hammering against his ribs,gradually settled in the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela...&#34; Cedric&#39;s lips parted, but the words hesitated on his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to ask-was it true? That she could never bear children?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or did it even matter? Because, child or not, she was the only one he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if fate had stolen that possibility from her, his love for her remained unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the words never surfaced. Guilt coiled in his chest drowning everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he could do was hold her, his voice thick with emotion. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re the only one I love. Only you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s turmoil was so overwhelming that his secretary had to intervene, insisting he see a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela walked him downstairs, Carol intercepted her, phone in hand, displaying the night&#39;s biggest rumor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the pieces click someone had exposed her supposed inability to have children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The source? Bennett Group,&#34; Carol informed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a cold chuckle. &#34;Alexander really outdid himself this time-so reckless. Where is he hiding?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like he went abroad,&#34; Carol answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;The second he sets foot back here, I want to know. He and I have unfinished business.&#34; Carol let out a short laugh. &#34;Got it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, a topic surged to the top of the trending list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela was about to drift off at 2 A.M., Carol burst into the room, phone clutched in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you have to see this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela reached for the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The top headline displayed two all-too-familiar faces -her father and stepsister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One sat before the camera with glistening eyes, while the other sobbed theatrically, as if auditioning for an award-winning role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, ever the actor, sighed. &#34;I had no idea Daniela couldn&#39;t have children.&#34; The smirk threatening to break across his lips nearly betrayed his crocodile tears. &#34;Daniela, my dear daughter,you know l love you.It truly shatters my heart to hear such devastating news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce chimed in, &#34;Daniela, my dearest sister, I know you&#39;re still upset about Alexander, but come on, we&#39;re family. Holding grudges forever isn&#39;t good for anyone.Just come home-to the warm embrace of your loving family. So what if you can&#39;t have children? It&#39;s fine! I already had one, remember? My child is yours too. No need to worry, the Harper bloodline will live on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol clenched her jaw. &#34;Daniela, Joyce&#39;s face practically screams, &#39;Come to me, money!&#39; The Harper family? That woman doesn&#39;t even carry the Harper name!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned sharp as ice, her expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol exhaled sharply. &#34;Joyce gave her illegitimate kid the Harper surname. And now, she&#39;s keeping him out of school, waiting for his oh-so-wealthy aunt to pay for his elite education.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On screen, a small boy stretched out his arms, tears streaming down his face. &#34;Aunt Daniela, I&#39;m Jack!Please come home! I miss you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little boy-Jack-Joyce&#39;s unwanted souvenir from a bar fling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone so young, Jack had already inherited his mother&#39;s cunning nature, a short temper, and a mean streak that flared up whenever things didn&#39;t go his way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s face darkened. &#34;Daniela, the rumors are out of control. People are convinced you&#39;re barren,and now they think Jack will inherit everything. They&#39;re even sending him gifts.&#34; Carol studied Daniela&#39;s eerily calm face. &#34;Daniela, you can&#39;t let them spread this garbage. No doctor ever confirmed you can&#39;t have kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a cold chuckle. &#34;If they&#39;re already fighting over my wealth, I might as well face those vultures myself. Are they living in my villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a sharp nod. &#34;Yeah. After the old warehouse blew up and you were sent abroad, Caiden and Joyce wasted no time moving in. And of course,Caiden never misses a chance to say the villa is his.&#34;</p>
