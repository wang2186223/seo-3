                <p>The McCoy brothers couldn&#39;t believe their ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had done nothing to harm them yet,but betrayal had come first from their own blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Brad dug out the termination letter cutting ties between Maximo&#39;s company and McCoy Group, then spotted Maximo&#39;s fresh deal with &#34;Brilliant Stars,&#34;every last bit of hope caved in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s voice cracked. &#34;Josh, did you do this to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh leaned back, puffing on his cigar, finally dropping the kind mask he&#39;d worn for decades. &#34;Yes, I did.Instead of watching Daniela drain our money dry, l chose to steer the business my way. Father always said the family wealth should stay within the clan. Now I&#39;m just claiming my rightful share. Isn&#39;t that fair? Stop acting wronged. I carried you all for years. Think of this as you paying me back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the brothers see the truth-all those years of Josh&#39;s kindness carried a hidden bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh tapped ash off his cigar. &#34;Don&#39;t sulk too much.I left you scraps. Took the big contracts-the small ones are yours to play with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy brothers stood there gutted, too stunned to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad rasped out, &#34;Josh, McCoy Group was solid.Why ruin it like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added, &#34;Exactly. Why tear it apart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan could barely believe what he was hearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s tone stayed dry, eyes cold. &#34;Why? Think about it. Mason can&#39;t produce an heir. I need to secure my future. You call me good brother to my face but mock my branch behind my back. Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t hear the whispers that I&#39;ve got no heir. You pretended to trust me, handed over the company, thinking l wouldn&#39;t dare fight for it. Well, guess what. I will fight.People say Hamilton&#39;s the capable one, Brad is the smooth talker, Jules is the sharp one, Ethan&#39;s the worldly one. Fine. I&#39;ll show you all that I&#39;m not a fool.I&#39;ve always had it in me. I just hid it well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s stare turned icy. &#34;So this grand ambition of yours is just poaching McCoy Group&#39;s biggest client?How noble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mockery sliced through Josh&#39;s pride like a blade.&#34;Don&#39;t act high and mighty, Hamilton. You think Daniela&#39;s baby will see daylight? Keep dreaming. Mark my words-your luck&#39;s about to run out!&#34; Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed, voice dropping to a chill.&#34;What are you trying to say, Josh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s lips curled in a smug grin. &#34;Exactly what you think. You all knew from the start we&#39;d never let Daniela&#39;s baby be born. Why act shocked now? You&#39;re all hypocrites.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot to his feet, grabbed Josh by the collar,and barked, &#34;What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sneered back, eyes cold as ice. &#34;&#39;If you&#39;re so capable, dig it up yourself. But hear me now-that baby won&#39;t draw a single breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton lunged for the door,but Brad caught his arm.&#34;Hamilton, forget Daniela&#39;s child for now. The family&#39;s about to collapse. Focus!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shoved him aside. &#34;We&#39;ll talk later. I&#39;m heading to Daniela&#39;s place first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed off without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the brothers stood frozen, trading panicked looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad wet his lips, then stepped closer and murmured,&#34;Josh, there&#39;s still room to talk this out, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; Josh didn&#39;t miss a beat. Relief flickered across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad forced a chuckle. &#34;I knew you wouldn&#39;t turn your back on us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, eager, &#34;Yeah, Josh. We knew you cared. So, when do we get the client and the contracts back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh leaned back, voice flat. &#34;When I said we could negotiate, I meant you can talk about handing me even more of McCoy Group&#39;s businesses. I&#39;ll gladly take them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles dropped. Blood drained from their faces all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, Josh gathered his things, walked out of McCoy Group, and moved straight into his new office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brothers scrambled to the finance team, hoping to see what was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh hadn&#39;t spared them-more than half the company&#39;s wealth was gone with him. The once-mighty McCoy Group now sat gutted and trembling at the edge of ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One accountant pushed up his glasses, voice low but urgent. &#34;If word leaks and the few small clients left follow Josh to his new firm, McCoy Group is finished. We&#39;d better choose a new CEO before that happens.&#34;</p>
