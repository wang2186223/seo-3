                <p>Daniela remained silent, her only emotion being pure disgust. &#34;Alexander, are you sure you&#39;re confessing to the right person? I&#39;m married. Are you seriously trying to pursue me? Do you enjoy being a home-wrecker?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s head jerked up, his eyes clouded with hurt beneath the brim of his hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides,Alexander,you&#39;venevertruly understoodme,&#34;Daniela added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned,Alexander protested, &#34;That can&#39;t be! Daniela,we&#39;ve known each other for years. How could I possibly not understand you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you honestly think you know me? I&#39;m not the kind of person who dwells on the past-be it people or things.I married Cedric because I genuinely love him.Haven&#39;t you ever wondered how I can always tell that you&#39;re not Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Alexander asked, his gaze locked on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I love him. The first clue was a scar. Then,there was a habit of yours that didn&#39;t match. And over time, even the smallest gesture of yours was enough for me to recognize that you weren&#39;t Cedric.&#34; Alexander&#39;s eyes went wide with shock. &#34;A scar?Where is it? No way! The plastic surgeon made sure l was an exact replica of Cedric, down to the smallest detail!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed, shaking her head. She had said plenty,yet he only clung to what suited him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander tensed, as though he&#39;d just uncovered a vital secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it-Daniela saw through him because of a scar he didn&#39;t even know existed. If he recreated that scar, he could deceive her once more. He could reclaim her smile, her protection-everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by desperation, Alexander tugged his hat down further, as if trying to disappear from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching the bank transfer device from the table, he thrust it into Daniela&#39;s hand and rushed out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would leave the country, undergo another surgery.He would become Cedric-the man Daniela loved-through and through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before departing, Alexander shot a message to the company&#39;s finance team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter how much is spent, don&#39;t report it to me.My wife is the one using the money.&#34; The finance team confirmed the instruction but couldn&#39;t help feeling confused. His wife? Did he mean Joyce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela brushed Alexander off and headed upstairs to play cards with Ryan and Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days later, A newly formed group of members convened at the commerce association,initiating yet another business embargo against Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they quickly found out their efforts were useless -there was no reaction at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Elite Lux held a groundbreaking fashion show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunning models showcased exquisite designs on the nation&#39;s most prestigious stage, captivating the audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The public remained indifferent to the intense corporate warfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fashion show turned out to be a spectacular triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux celebrated its most remarkable success in years,raking in tens of billions in on-site orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this single move, the association&#39;s embargo became meaningless. One by one, members started silently pulling out of the association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett scowled as he scanned the latest membership report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey slammed his fist down. &#34;Daniela&#39;s going too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno propped his head on his hand,frowning.&#34;What the hell is Daniela up to? Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Farley, visibly frustrated, snapped, &#34;Is there really no one who can step in? If Daniela keeps pushing like this,our business embargo will become nothing more than a laughingstock!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett narrowed his eyes. &#34;I&#39;ve already dispatched someone to track down Richard. He claims he&#39;s with Alexander in another country. Who knows what they&#39;re up to while we&#39;re dealing with this crisis here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno nervously rubbed his hands, his voice dropping.&#34;Is Daniela coming after us because of what happened to Brylee? Why else would she single us out? We&#39;ve always been courteous to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in his chair, Hackett narrowed his eyes.&#34;Caiden lost his mind, Katrina&#39;s dead, Elyse vanished,and Natalie fled the country. Now, Daniela is coming after us. Given all that, it&#39;s highly likely that her sudden hostility stems from Brylee&#39;s dea Bruno&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;So... what&#39;s our move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus lifted a hand. &#34;Let&#39;s not lose our heads. What if we&#39;re wrong? If we act rashly, we might expose ourselves. Let&#39;s invite Daniela to dinner and feel her out first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey shuddered. &#34;Daniela&#39;s brutal-she won&#39;t let us off easy. So many companies have gone bankrupt lately. Who&#39;s to say we won&#39;t be next? I refuse to let my family&#39;s business collapse while it&#39;s under my watch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s face darkened. &#34;Enough talk. We need to gauge the situation. Get ready. My secretary will set up a dinner with Daniela. Stay alert. I hear Cedric means a lot to her. We&#39;ll split up-one group will test Daniela,the other will work on Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey jumped in. &#34;I&#39;ll deal with Cedric. Honestly,Daniela&#39;s cutthroat approach freaks me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another said, &#34;I&#39;ll handle Cedric too. Daniela is too unpredictable, and I don&#39;t want to risk making a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s eyes narrowed in irritation. &#34;Fine! I&#39;ll handle her myself! Huey,Marcus,you&#39;re coming with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Huey&#39;s and Marcus&#39;faces fell instantly.They had hoped for an easier task. Things had been unbearably tense lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, Cedric seemed like the safer bet.</p>
