                <p>Cedric exhibited patience and tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head gently. &#34;That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Cedric reached for Daniela&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sensed her initial hesitation and did not grasp it immediately. Instead, he waited until she loosened her fingers slightly before taking her hand once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; Cedric called out as the morning light illuminated his face, making his eyes sparkle with the reflection of her. &#34;I&#39;m not Caiden; I&#39;m Cedric. You are not your mother; you are Daniela, a remarkable woman in your own right. Your strength doesn&#39;t intimidate me; it makes me want to ensure your happiness even more. Your power doesn&#39;t scare me;it fills me with pride. I&#39;m not without ambitions; I have my pride and my own capabilities. So, Daniela, is it me you doubt, or yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was not one to speak often, but his words always carried weight and assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as he spoke, Daniela found herself unable to dispute his points. She clenched her hand, yet she hesitated to agree outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric asked, &#34;You&#39;re thinking it&#39;s all happening too quickly, aren&#39;t you? Change is always a bit daunting,but don&#39;t let the unfamiliarity deter you from moving forward,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found no words to counter him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling sleepy?&#34; Cedric kept his gaze steady, his smile convincing. &#34;If you&#39;re tired, why not rest here in the living room? If not, perhaps we could go register our marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked in surprise. &#34;Are you in such a rush?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was indeed cluttered at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been buried in paperwork, had a draining discussion with Caiden, and now was navigating this moment with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were tangled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a thorough discussion was necessary to clarify their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was naturally aware of Daniela&#39;s reservations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood her concerns perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, he admitted he would use any means necessary to secure Daniela&#39;s commitment today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he waited until tomorrow, once Daniela had time to think it over, he feared he might lose his chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though anxious, Cedric hid his feelings well, asking smoothly, &#34;Any more doubts? Let&#39;s discuss them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He maintained a calm demeanor while subtly pressing forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a simple, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it the pace that bothers you? Do you think we&#39;re moving too quickly?&#34; Cedric asked further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela confirmed with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too quickly, you say?&#34; Cedric asked. &#34;I&#39;ve made my choice, and you&#39;ve given your promise. It&#39;s inevitable,whether it happens today or tomorrow. Does the timing truly make a difference?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela found her thoughts increasingly scrambled by Cedric&#39;s arguments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued, &#34;If we are destined together, why not fully embrace our future now? You&#39;ll need to come to terms with this eventually, and I&#39;m here to support you as you adjust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela bit her lip thoughtfully. &#34;How much time will you give me to adapt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s for you to decide. Whenever you&#39;re ready,we&#39;ll share the same bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blushed deeply. &#34;That&#39;s not what | was referring to.&#34; Cedric laughed. &#34;Of course, not that. Let&#39;s secure our marriage certificate today. As for the rest, you set the pace. It&#39;s only fair. You once promised me a favor,and this is all l ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Cedric had laid out a strategic plan,and she was inadvertently playing into his hands at every turn.</p>
