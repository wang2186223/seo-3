                <p>&#34;Do you really think you can just stroll in here as if it&#39;s some kind of hotel?&#34; Daniela asked coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood by, watching the scene unfold with a hint of amusement on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hadn&#39;t expected Daniela to say that.He began to explain gently, &#34;Katrina told me she&#39;s been feeling unwell and doesn&#39;t have anyone to look after her. She was hoping I could stay for a few days to help. You don&#39;t mind,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he finished speaking, Alexander picked up his luggage and started walking inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Daniela retorted, &#34;Actually, I do mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander froze for a moment, staring at Daniela in disbelief.&#34;What did you say?&#34; The Harper family&#39;s villa, once owned by Brylee at the height of her wealth, stood as one of the most luxurious properties around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With more than 30 guest rooms, there was pleny of space for Alexander to settle in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander never imagined Daniela would turn him away, not even offering him a single room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I mind,&#34; Daniela repeated, her voice steady and firm. &#34;This is my home, and you have no right to stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was about to speak, but Daniela interrupted her. &#34;Just because I&#39;ve been quiet doesn&#39;t mean Katrina gets to call the shots here. Got it? I don&#39;t agree,so you can&#39;t stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina bit her bottom lip, a touch of embarrassment crossing her face. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t be so bossy. It&#39;s just for a few days. Plus, we all know each other. So,why make it harder for him? What did I do wrong?Tell me, and I&#39;ll fix it. Just don&#39;t make things difficult for Alexander,alright?&#34;  At that, Daniela let out a soft chuckle. &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was momentarily surprised, and then a smile spread across her face. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll let Alexander-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katrina could finish, Daniela continued, &#34;I told you before. If you don&#39;t behave, there&#39;s no place for you in the villa. Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Daniela&#39;s indifferent gaze, Katrina felt a surge of anxiety wash over her. She muttered, &#34;How can you be like this? I didn&#39;t mean anything by it. I&#39;ve already made that clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela picked up her phone to call the moving department of Elite Lux. &#34;Send a team over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, she returned to watching TV,completely ignoring the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking the matter was settled, Katrina told Alexander to head to the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, nearly 100 people arrived, beginning to move Katrina&#39;s and Caiden&#39;s belongings out of the house and into a small shed nearby. Daniela! You&#39;re taking this too far!&#34; Katrina exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze stayed icy as she replied, &#34;I can make things even harder for you. Want to test me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was stunned for a moment, then gritted her teeth. &#34;I&#39;m not moving out of this house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing, her silence heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Katrina stayed or left was never a decision she had the right to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The leader of the moving staff approached Daniela and reported, &#34;Ms. Harper, the move is complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina didn&#39;t have many personal belongings, and the shed provided barely enough room for them. The task was finished quickly, thanks to the large group of movers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pointed at Katrina with obvious hatred and instructed the leader, &#34;Take her away. Make sure to station security at the front door. Don&#39;t let anyone in without permission.&#34; Events unfolded with such speed that Caiden found himself unable to respond before it was all said and done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, he shouted, &#34;Daniela, this has nothing to do with me. You&#39;re taking it out on the wrong person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ignored him, her attention staying fixed on the TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, the villa was enveloped in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Alexander, who stood motionless at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze returned to the TV, and she asked coolly,&#34;Will you be leaving on your own, or should I have someone escort you out?&#34;</p>
