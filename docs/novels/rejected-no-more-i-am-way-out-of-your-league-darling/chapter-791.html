                <p>Hamilton left without another word, a small group  trailing behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind in the aftermath, the rest of the McCoy family stood in tense silence, eyes darting between one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the stillness, Nikolas finally spoke, his tone brittle with uncertainty.&#34;What Cedric said earlier... do you think he really meant all of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;You think he was faking it?He said it to Dad&#39;s face,loud and clear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles exhaled deeply. &#34;Back when Cedric claimed he had no interest in the fortune, I thought it was just an act. But now? I believe him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon rubbed his brow. &#34;Doesn&#39;t that just make us look like fools? The way we treated him... it was a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duran hesitated before chiming in, &#34;Do you think Dad will actually retaliate? He seemed ready to do something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single question landed like a stone, dragging the entire room into silence. After a long moment, Nikolas responded, &#34;I doubt it. I mean, Cedric is family. When I went into Dad&#39;s study earlier, I saw the paternity test report. Cedric is his biological son. You know how serious Dad is-he even brought a lawyer today. He wouldn&#39;t have done that if he had doubts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen crossed his arms, still tense. &#34;Even so, I&#39;ve never seen Dad that furious. Not once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles looked down briefly, then spoke in a low voice &#34;If he decides to come after Daniela and Cedric, what do you think he&#39;ll do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s face darkened. &#34;He won&#39;t hold back.He&#39;ll make Cedric wish he&#39;d never walked away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words landed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas flinched. His expression tightened as a new thought crept in-if Hamilton really unleashed his fury on Cedric, what would happen to his own standing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever brief comfort Nikolas had felt was gone now -replaced by a gnawing sense of dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the brothers drifted off, each lost in his own tangle of worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed quietly-at least on the surface. Then,trouble began to ripple outward. Daniela&#39;s restaurant came to a sudden standstill, struggling to acquire the most basic ingredients</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, their construction froze as well.Materials ordered from Olisvine never arrived. No explanation. Just silence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry etched across his features, Nikolas called an urgent meeting with his brothers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This situation is spiraling,&#34; he said, his voice low and heavy. &#34;If things keep heading in this direction, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Daniela and Cedric fold under Dad&#39;s pressure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s expression turned stormy. &#34;And when that happens, the inheritance gets stretched thinner. One more name on the list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not just one,&#34; Nikolas said sharply. &#34;Cedric has a wife,and she&#39;s not exactly weak. If they ever decide to have a child, that kid would be Dad&#39;s first grandchild -automatically in line for the McCoy legacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of that possibility hit the room hard,draining color from their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have to act now,&#34; Nikolas continued, his tone firm.&#34;We need to force them out of Oiscoll before Dad wins them over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one protested-except Damon. The other four nodded without hesitation. Later that day, Damon happened to run into Daniela,and something about her presence caught him completely off guard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re actually Shim?&#34; All this time, it had felt like some distant dream.Now, his idol was standing right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod.′′|there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon, struggling to keep his emotions in check,said,&#34;You&#39;ve been someone I&#39;ve looked up to for so many years, and that&#39;s wvhy I had to come warn you. You and Cedric need to leave as soon as possible. My father isn&#39;t the type to show any mercy. His tactics are far more ruthless than anything Nikolas would ever do.You won&#39;t be able to handle what he has planned.And it&#39;s not just him-the other brothers don&#39;t want you in Oiscoll either. The McCoy family holds enormous power here. You&#39;ve provoked him, and because of that, there&#39;s no chance you&#39;ll be able to establish a successful business. Please, get out while you still have the chance&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile tugged at Daniela&#39;s líps. &#34;I appreciate you coming to tell me. But I&#39;m not going anywhere. I don&#39;t believe that I will lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a gust of wind swept through the street,catching strands of her long hair and lifting them into  the air like a flag raised in quiet rebellion</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stood there, staring at her unshaken expression, and something settled inside him. There was no longer any doubt-she truly was Shim.</p>
