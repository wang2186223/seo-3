                <p>Katrina watched, stunned, as Joyce knelt before Daniela. Her eyes widened with shock. Struggling to her feet, she cried out, &#34;Joyce! Have you lost your senses? How can you kneel before Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, her own daughter, was kneeling to Daniela, Brylee&#39;s daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Katrina, having battled to surpass Brylee, this was tantamount to a crushing defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a silent confession of her defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! She wouldn&#39;t lose! How could she lose to Brylee&#39;s daughter? Never!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Joyce, stand up!&#34; Katrina yelled, her face contorted with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her throbbing head, she tried to pull Joyce away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joyce held firmly to Daniela&#39;s pants, unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela sit upright with a chilly look, Katrina&#39;s stance faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela looked up and their eyes met, Katrina felt as if she saw Brylee&#39;s reflection in her. Guilt washed over her, and she quickly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce, unaware of the emnotional turmoil, continued to thud her head against the floor.In desperation, she blurted out to Daniela, &#34;These shares are worth a lot! I&#39;ll sell them to you for just twenty million. Hand me the money, and they&#39;re yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose slowly, gazing down at Joyce with clear disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her look was as dismissive as one might glance at an unworthy pet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a calm, measured voice, Daniela responded, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but you can&#39;t alter the past. The profits have already been allocated to a new venture, so withdrawing them isn&#39;t possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela skillfully shifted the blame onto Katrina. For the first time, Katrina witnessed a profound hatred in Joyce&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart quivered as she murmured, &#34;Joyce, I did everything for your benefit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For my benefit? That&#39;s laughable. Where were you when the Bennett family shunned me? Why did you arrange my marriage to Alexander, only to leave me feeling deserted? And now, you alone decide on my shares! Ten years without dividends-what good are these shares to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had less than ten days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t send money to Milo within ten days, he&#39;d leave her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought triggered a surge of panic in Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared losing Milo and couldn&#39;t accept that possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush,Joyce ran off,Katrina&#39;s voice echoing after her into the void.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, everyone in Olisvine was reeling from the robot company&#39;s announcement of a ten-year halt on dividends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Weren&#39;t they making regular payouts before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, I&#39;ve just invested in a villa, relying on those returns. What about my mortgage now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve purchased a luxury vehicle. Without those dividends, I can&#39;t even cover the fuel costs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My entire retirement hinges on these dividends. What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard, who had recently funneled his retirement funds into the company, was awaiting another significant return when the payments abruptly stopped.	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale and unsteady, he contacted the company&#39;s operations manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager courteously explained that the dividend suspension was due to internal business decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard felt something was amiss with Daniela&#39;s management style. As he prepared to confront her, the association that had dealings with Daniela&#39;s company came to a decisive conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, your family has really put us in a difficult position!&#34;</p>
