                <p>As Daniela made her way home from work, she scrutinized the surroundings from her car window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She keenly sensed she was being followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least ten cars shadowed her own, maintaining a cautious distance without making any overt moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching home, Daniela told Cedric, &#34;You head inside. I need a moment to make a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric agreed, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll prepare some fresh fruit for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a quiet nod, signaling her agreement without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Cedric stepped into the villa, Daniela slowly raised her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expressionless,she slowly raised her hand, her fingers forming a mock gun,and pretended to fire it into the air ten times before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in a car, a man hastily dialed an overseas number.&#34;Boss,we&#39;ve run into a problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, icy voice crackled through the phone, dripping with disdain. &#34;Are you all incompetent?I′Vpaid you handsomely, and yet you struggle with a simple task? Cedric is nothing but a crippled loser,a mere businessman. How can he possibly be a problem for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,he&#39;s not the problem; it&#39;s the person around him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who else could be there? A secretary, maybe a colleague? Spare me the excuses. Eliminate Cedric before I arrive in Olisvine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we&#39;ll try our best,but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No &#39;buts&#39;! If you&#39;re incapable of handling someone like Cedric, maybe it&#39;s time I start looking for your replacement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man in the car opened his mouth to protest, but the line went dead, the call ending with a series of harsh beeps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled bitterly to himself, a sense of defeat washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they only known that Cedric&#39;s wife, Daniela, was none other than the legendary mercenary commander Clarinda,they wouldn&#39;t have come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the shadow of Clarinda, they were all rendered powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, Cedric was pacing in the courtyard, phone pressed to his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, watch your back. A bunch of hired guns is after you,&#34; said his subordinate from Lone wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brow furrowed as he asked, &#34;Who could be orchestrating this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unclear. Didn&#39;t you commit us to a clean operation,steering clear of our old ways? I got wind of this and rang you immediately. For now, they&#39;re merely observing-biding their time. Didn&#39;t you say your wife was timid? Perhaps it&#39;s porudent to leave her place for a bit, so that she won&#39;t get frightened. I&#39;ll send people to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the floor-to-ceiling window,Cedric observed Daniela standing at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She faced him, making some gesture. Her form appeared fragile in the dim light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric responded,&#34;Alright. I&#39;m leaving her place today.Arrange for a few people to guard my wife. Continue to look for Natalie and Winslow,but keep my wife out of it. She&#39;s unaccustomed to such situations. We mustn&#39;t frighten her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,boss. Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ve got everything under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela walked in, Cedric was still engrossed in a phone conversation out in the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden lounged on the couch,idly flicking through his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela removed her shoes and stepped further into the house, her eyes lingered momentarily on a certain place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She maintained her composure, casting a quick,discreet glance at Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared detached, seemingly oblivious to her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, Daniela headed towards the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the landing, she called out, &#34;Tasha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, Tasha appeared, wiping her hands.&#34;Yes? What do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you come with me for a second?&#34; Daniela requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha ascended the stairs, and Daniela entered her bedroom, washed her face, and then asked, &#34;There used to be a small clay figurine by the TV stand in the líving room. It seems to be missing today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s words, a look of alarm swept over Tasha&#39;s face.</p>
