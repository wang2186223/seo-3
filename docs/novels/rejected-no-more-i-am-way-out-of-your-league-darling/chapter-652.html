                <p>Joyce shot up from her seat, her shock evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face bore an obedience so unnatural that even his own mother would have doubted her eyes.What in the world was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, will you be home for lunch?&#34; Jack asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela put on her shoes and headed upstairs, with Jack following behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So focused on keeping up, he completely overlooked Joyce standing in the kitchen, watching the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack, being small, usually avoided the struggle of climbing stairs, opting for the indoor elevator instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,he trotted up behind Daniela without a single complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept moving without pause. &#34;I won&#39;t be home for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack huffed as he climbed another step.&#34;Will you be back for dinner?&#34; &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll be back for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack brightened instantly. &#34;Then after dinner, we can watch TV together! I really liked that show you were watching last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stepped into her room, but when Jack attempted to follow, she halted him at the doorway &#34;I need to change. You&#39;re not allowed in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tiny terror who usually bossed everyone around was suddenly the picture of patience. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll wait right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack stood guard by the door, sneaking glances behind him every few seconds as if worried she might slip away unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,after watching in amusement, turned to the utterly baffled Joyce. &#34;And you were just saying she had to convince him to take a walk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shut her eyes for a second, irritation flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a brat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whose kid was he supposed to be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Joyce turned to the stairs, Daniela&#39;s door creaked open, and Jack&#39;s face lit up with anticipation.&#34;Daniela, can I come to work with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine then, I&#39;ll just wait for you to get home after work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela stepped out, Jack hurried over, holding out her shoes. &#34;Be careful out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha watched the exchange, shaking her head. If someone didn&#39;t know any better, they&#39;d think Jack was Daniela&#39;s own kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Daniela and Carol were out the door,Joyce stomped to Jack, her patience wearing thin.&#34;You traitor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,guess what? Daniela is incredible! She knows every single flower in the garden!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce huffed, clearly unimpressed. &#34;I know them too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But she also knows all the myths and legends behind them! She&#39;s amazing! And she told me that even if the kids at school don&#39;t like me, it doesn&#39;t matter.I should love myself first! Once I do that, people will start liking me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s brows knitted together. &#34;What? The kids in your class don&#39;t like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack shook his head. &#34;I told them I&#39;m a rich heir and  that I&#39;ll inherit all of Aunt Daniela&#39;s wealth. They look down on me, push me around, even hit me. But Mom,I was just repeating what you told me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pressed her lips into a thin line. &#34;You&#39;re right,sweetheart. They don&#39;t deserve to play with you. Later,ask Daniela to tell you more stories. And we&#39;ll get you into a private school. The kids there are well-mannered. They won&#39;t ignore you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack&#39;s face turned serious. &#34;But she said she won&#39;t send me to a private school. She said we&#39;re not even family,so she doesn&#39;t have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flared in Joyce&#39;s eyes the second she heard that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot to her feet and turned to Caiden. &#34;Dad,do you hear the nonsense Daniela is filling Jack&#39;s head with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack beamed, completely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela played with him, talked to him, and even promised that if he behaved, she&#39;d teach him how to shatter glass with a single slap-just like she did yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Daniela was a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Daniela was the most beautiful person in the world.Beautiful people could be forgiven for anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce had no clue that her son had a weakness for pretty faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood in the middle of the living room, practically steaming with fury</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jack eyed his mother&#39;s fiery glare, a sigh of regret forming in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Daniela were his mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela would never look this fierce-like an angry lioness ready to pounce.</p>
