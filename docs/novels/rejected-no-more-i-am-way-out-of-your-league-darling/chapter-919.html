                <p>Josh could barely contain his frustration. &#34;Alright,fine! If Hamilton doesn&#39;t show up, so be it. I refuse to believe I can&#39;t fix this mess without him. So the stock dropped a bit? I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s brows drew together in concern. &#34;You&#39;re missing the point, Josh. This isn&#39;t just about your pride; it&#39;s about the company&#39;s finances. We can&#39;t let the stock fall any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules chimed in, &#34;Exactly! Hamilton ran things for years, and the stock never took a dive like this. But now, after just a couple of days with you at the helm,we&#39;re already in trouble. Honestly, if things keep going south, maybe it&#39;s time to bring Hamilton back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot Jules a fierce glare. &#34;What was that? You want Hamilton back in charge? Are you insane?I fought tooth and nail to get here. If I step aside now, you know what&#39;ll happen. Hamilton will just turn around and hand everything to Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes, voice cold. &#34;Let me spell it out. If Cedric gets his hands on the compány,Daniela&#39;s coming for you. She&#39;ll make you pay for what happened to her mother. You&#39;ve seen what Daniela&#39;s capable of. She could crash McCoy Group&#39;s stock overnight if she wants to. If this company falls into their hands, you&#39;ll all be out on the street. Daniela has no mercy. Now that things are tough, you&#39;re suddenly remembering all the good things about Hamilton. Don&#39;t forget that he&#39;s Daniela&#39;s father-in-law. But you are nothing to her.When push comes to shove, do you really think Hamilton would go down with you? Think about that before you run to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Josh stormed out to smoke, leaving a tense silence in his wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad let out a string of curses. &#34;Damn it. If we&#39;d known things would end up like this, maybe we never should&#39;ve killed Daniela&#39;s mother in thefirst place.&#34; Jules just shook his head and sighed. &#34;No use regrettingit now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh has a point. Daniela&#39;s clearly out for revenge. If we put Hamilton in charge of McCoy Group, he&#39;ll just hand everything over to Cedric. And with how Cedric hangs on Daniela&#39;s every word, we might as well give the company to her outright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective sigh went around the room as everyone tried to settle Josh&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, don&#39;t take it personally. We&#39;re still family.We&#39;ve always trusted you, Josh. Just tell us what to do next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh barked, &#34;First thing, I&#39;m calling an emergency meeting.Ask every executive to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh planted himself at the head of the table, hands braced on his hips. &#34;I don&#39;t care how you do it, just make sure the stock stops dropping. McCoy Group pays you well, so don&#39;t just sit there waiting for me to spell everything out.&#34; Running a business was uncharted territory for Josh.In his mind, as long as he put money on the table, he expected everyone to deliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meeting heated up, he went down the line,singling out each executive and tearing into them without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never bothered with tact, and today, his temper flared so much that he ended up calling the marketing manager good-for-nothing..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went dead silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager, who was known for her confidence and steady nerves, actually found herself tearing up. &#34;Mr. McCoy, none of us saw this coming.It&#39;s not fair to unload your anger on us just because things went wrong out of the blue. I&#39;ve spent years working hard for McCoy Group. Not once did Hamilton belittle me or treat the senior staff with disrespect. When we faced setbacks, we tackled them together. Hónestly, your outbursts make me question if you&#39;re really cut out to lead or if you even care about the people who keep this company running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh never imagined anyone would push back against him. His expression darkened as he snapped,&#34;You all claim to be top-tier professionals? If you were as skilled as you claim, McCoy Group&#39;s stock wouldn&#39;t be in freefall right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The marketing manager looked at him in disbelief.&#34;You&#39;re not just attacking me; you&#39;re undermining every executive here. Under Hamilton, McCoy Group stayed steady. Since you took over, everything&#39;s been chaos. Maybe the real problem isn&#39;t with us,but with your decisions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the sharp crack of a slap rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire boardroom was frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the secretary taking notes at the far end of the table flinched, hands hovering over the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could have guessed Josh would actually strike an employee, let alone someone who&#39;d been loyal to McCoy Group for years. No matter what excuses he might have, any man with a shred of decency or proper upbringing would know better than to raise a hand against a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stared, stunned, as the secretary pushed his glasses up and hurriedly documented every word.</p>
