                <p>Nikolas stood outside McCoy Group&#39;s headquarters,jaw tight and eyes locked on the commotion happening across the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a pack of greedy pests,&#34; he muttered, face dark as thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, an older woman pointed straight at him and raised her voice loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that we&#39;re unreasonable. That man over there told us to complain-said your construction was noisy and messy. He wanted us to stir up trouble so you&#39;d shut it down. Now that I say it out loud, that&#39;s just plain dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a soft smile and turned her head to meet Nikolas&#39; glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes burned with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from him, Daniela stood with her arms folded,a smirk tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t hold it in. His face twisted, and he spun on his heel, storming back into McCoy Group&#39;s building. As Daniela watched him go, her smile grew even wider. Then she felt another stare. She glanced up without surprise. Hamilton was watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled again-this time sharper-and without a word,turned and walked into her building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton caught the whole thing. His secretary leaned in and whispered, &#34;Sir, Daniela&#39;s too clever. Nikolas doesn&#39;t stand a chance against her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just one move, Daniela hadn&#39;t only protected her team. She gained public favor and built solid ground for her company&#39;s image going forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton narrowed his eyes. &#34;She&#39;s interesting.Let&#39;s see what kind of cards they play next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric had contacted some of the country&#39;s top designers. Within three days,they delivered a brand-new blueprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The design had been improved. New depth, fresh color, and creative layers brought the previously plain structure to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the final version approved, it was time to break ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the bidding for contractors opened, no companies stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Cedric thought maybe construction wasn&#39;t booming in Oiscoll. Then it hit him-Nikolas had already spread the word. Anyone who took this job would be going against the McCoy family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under that kind of pressure, no one dared make a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric clenched his jaw and was just about to contact a domestic firm when a group suddenly arrived on site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same construction team that had built two of Daniela&#39;s towers in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped out of private jets and gathered at the entrance. Soon enough, the renovation kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; second attempt to sabotage the project had failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stayed focused on the build while Daniela managed everything on the business end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol came rushing in, breathless. &#34;Daniela! The hotels around here are all claiming to be booked, but l checked-none of them are full. I found out it&#39;s Nikolas. He&#39;s the one pressuring them not to take in our crew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed lightly. &#34;Childish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol crossed her arms. &#34;Maybe so, but it&#39;s working. colas still has pull in Oiscoll. People listen when he rs up trouble. We&#39;re stuck without places to eat or ep. You&#39;ve got to fix this.&#34; niela&#39;s eyes moved to the pile of suitcases stacked  the entrance. She turned to Carol. &#34;The upper ors used to be a hotel. Prep the space for our crew.d those folks we paid earlier? Locals. Not tied to 12bibusiness groups. Go to their neighborhoods and quo t hiring for cleaning, meals, and kitchen work. If y don&#39;t cut it, we&#39;ll replace them later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>noi</p>
                
                
                
                <p>enivzpl&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Perfect! I just talked to an older nan earlier-said she used to be a chef. I&#39;ll go get st6 now! Daniela, you always know what to do!&#34;31 904</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the end of the day, the workers were housed 52 of ting from the twentieth floor. The top experts ed in Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>け no ol rallied the locals into a team. They worked fast,id erl the whole place buzzed with energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lrteee again, Nikolas had played his hand-and lost.</p>
