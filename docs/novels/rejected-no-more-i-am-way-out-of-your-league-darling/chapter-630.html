                <p>Daniela slowly turned her head, her gaze sharpening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stood at the doorway, her voice edged with vindication. &#34;You were right all along!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the biting chill of the night, Daniela&#39;s expression turned just as frigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s lips curled in disapproval. &#34;She&#39;s still in touch with Cedric. For the past three years, she&#39;s visited him regularly. Ever since he woke up, she&#39;s been tending to his every need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s voice tightened with anger. &#34;From what I&#39;ve found, she&#39;s been incredibly devoted to him.Daniela,think about it-was that explosion Cedric&#39;s doing?Did he try to eliminate you for Elite Lux&#39;s fortune, only to miscalculate and end up crippled himself? If so, he&#39;s only reaping what he sowed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained by the window, silent and unmoving,lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she turned back, the black car had already vanished into the night&#39;s abyss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, catching the shift in Daniela&#39;s expression,grew restless. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t be swayed by his frailty. The ones who seem the most pitiful are often the most corrupt at heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice hardened. &#34;Let me handle them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela&#39;s tone was final. &#34;You can go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;Daniela, don&#39;t fall for that act! Cedric is no different from Alexander-both cut from the same deceitful cloth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room lapsed into a heavy, calculated silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stormed out, her frustration palpable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day,Alexander strolled in with a bright smile. &#34;Daniela, I know you&#39;re swamped and barely have time for anything, so l figured lunch break was the best chance to catch you. How about dinner with my father tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing that Daniela might still see his father as the cold and ruthless man from before, Alexander quickly added, &#34;He personally asked me to bring you. He insists on cooking himself. Daniela, just this once.Please do me a favor.&#34; Daniela&#39;s eyes flicked up to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s requests were always different from Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in a plea, there was an effortless arrogance in Alexander&#39;s voice, a lingering sense of entitlement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years,Alexander had absorbed much of Elite Lux&#39;s empire. The collapse of the commerce association had worked in his favor, and now, his growing empire thrived-his every move calculated,his demeanor sharp with the cunning of a seasoned businessman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past three years remained a blur in Daniela&#39;s mind,like a story she had never read. And yet the lingering sense of distaste was sharp, unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to refuse instinctively, but Alexander quickly added with a smile, &#34;My father knows he wasn&#39;t exactly polite to you before, and he truly wants to make amends. He&#39;s not been in the best health lately. Daniela, please understand-it would mean a lot to me. Just this once, okay? How about a simple meal downstairs at your cafeteria instead of coming over to my place? Would that be alrigt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Daniela gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s grin widened, satisfaction lighting up his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But by evening,Alexander arrived downstairs, stepping into her office with an apologetic look. &#34;Daniela, I messed up. I forgot to tell my father about the change in plans, and he&#39;s already gone ahead and prepared dinner at home. If you don&#39;t come, I&#39;ll never hear the end of it. Just this once, come back with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained seated, her expression unreadable,her gaze steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Alexander dialed Richard and switched to speaker mode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s exasperated voice burst through the speaker.&#34;Alexander, what&#39;s the matter with you? Why didn&#39;t you mention this sooner? I absolutely have to have dinner with Daniela. I&#39;ll freshen up and leave right away. I should be there by 9 P.M. Can you wait until then? Alexander, I have no patience for you right now -give the phone to Daniela. At least she has a sensible head on her shoulders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sighed. &#34;You&#39;re on speaker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s tone softened instantly, slipping into warmth and familiarity. &#34;Daniela, my dear, I owe you an apology. You know how Alexander is-once he&#39;s buried in work, he forgets everything else. He&#39;s just that dedicated. I&#39;ve spent the entire day preparing a lavish meal. If you don&#39;t come, it&#39;ll all go to waste.You enjoy the food at your cafeteria, don&#39;t you? How about we meet there another day? But tonight, come to our place. You wouldn&#39;t believe how much my cooking has improved.&#34; Daniela&#39;s memories were erased. Yet in the fragments she did recall, there wasn&#39;t a single instance of Richard treating her with kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man she remembered had only ever looked at her with scorn, his eyes filled with derision and contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words still echoed in her mind-sharp, cruel, and unforgettable. &#34;Daniela, your mother is dead. Do you know what that means? It means she&#39;s gone for good.Society might not see you as worthy of Alexander anymore, but I&#39;m sentimental, so you should always be grateful to me. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she had been too young to fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had feared Richard, perhaps even respected him in a twisted way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,the once untouchable man put on a show of remorse. She found his act almost laughable-nothing more than a pitiful display of hypocrisy.</p>
