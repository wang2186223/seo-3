                <p>The secretary didn&#39;t sugarcoat his words. They came out so direct, Nikolas almost expected him to say,&#34;Don&#39;t bite off more than you can chew.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sat there, caught between anger and helplessness. Deep down, he knew Daniela had outplayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he muttered under his breath, &#34;Even if I give up, I doubt Daniela will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary offered a calm reply. &#34;Why not speak to her yourself? She doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas gave a short nod. &#34;Got it.&#34; His voice carried no strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t want more conflict. He was even willing to offer Hamilton a proper apology</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he moved toward the stairs, a car engine rumbled outside the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the window, he spotted the McCoy Group&#39;s asset lawyer stepping out of the vehicle. The butler met the man at the door They exchanged a few words before the lawyer hurried inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas overheard the butler&#39;s voice down the hall &#34;Mr. McCoy is waiting for you in the study.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lawyer walked upstairs and gave Nikolas a brief nod before disappearing behind the study door</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That room had thick walls. Not a sound made it through</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he couldn&#39;t hear what was being said,Nikolas had a feeling the meeting had something to do with the family&#39;s inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uneasy, he slipped out of the house and headed across the street to a small cafe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited there for more than three hours before the lawyer finally left the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sent him a short message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the man joined him at his table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.McCoy,&#34; the lawyer greeted, calm as ever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rose, gestured toward the empty seat,and said,&#34;Have a seat.&#34;He ordered a coffee for the man and spoke plainly &#34;Mr. Kelly, you and my uncle have been friends for years. He once said I could come to you if I ever had questions. So I won&#39;t waste time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul Kelly sat back and waited a moment before saying, &#34;Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas leaned in. &#34;Did my father ask you to make any changes to the original inheritance plan while you were here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul pressed his lips together before speaking with care. &#34;I can&#39;t give specifics, but I can say this-your father does consider all his children. Thatmuch,Iknow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message wasn&#39;t loud, but it hit hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lowered his eyes, his voice flat. &#34;Got it. Thank you,Mr.Kelly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raul got to his feet, then placed a hand on Nikolas &#39; shoulder. &#34;You&#39;ve got potential. If the path you&#39;re on feels tight, then carve your own. You&#39;ll go far, trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t need it spelled out. His father had never meant to hand him the legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew it was coming. Still, it burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed seated long after Raul left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally stood, his elbow bumped the coffee cup. It tipped over, spilling across the table and dripping to the floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, he went to Daniela&#39;s company. From the outside, he spotted her on a windowsill, sorting through data. Upstairs, Cedric was directing the team at the site. The skyscraper they&#39;d taken over was full of movement now. The future felt close enough to touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas felt all kinds of emotions swirling inside him.None of them were simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked up and called her name. &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up and met his eyes. &#34;I was hoping you had a minute,&#34; said Nikolas. &#34;There&#39;s something I&#39;d like to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the usual pride in his tone. &#34;I&#39;m not going to fight Cedric anymore. I&#39;m stepping back. And whatever I did to you before-I hope you can leave it behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t respond right away. Her eyes scanned his face, sharp and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she smiled. It wasn&#39;t kind. &#34;Do you really think you&#39;re in any place to bargain with me? Haven&#39;t you figured out who I am by now? I&#39;m miles ahead of you,Nikolas. And none of this was ever about you.&#34; She was never one to sugarcoat the truth. &#34;You&#39;ve misunderstood your role here. You&#39;re not even in a position to negotiate&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the one holding the power gets to make deals</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood there, not yet realizing how far behind he truly was</p>
