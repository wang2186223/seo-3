                <p>For some inexplicable reason, the childlike handwriting on the paper struck a chord of familiarity within Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt hauntingly familiar, as if he had encountered it somewhere in the past, yet he couldn&#39;t pinpoint exactly where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Joyce watched Alexander prepare to leave, a wistful sigh escaped her lips. &#34;When are you going to marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preoccupied, Alexander merely climbed into the car,leaving her question hanging unanswered in the chilly air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his vantage point next to the car, Richard caught sight of Joyce&#39;s reddened eyes. He offered a sympathetic comment. &#34;Go back inside. Don&#39;t worry.This will sort itself out soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, inwardly, he harbored a deep aversion towards Joyce.He thought her utterly foolish, behaving like a petulant child. Did she really believe the universe orbited around her whims?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Richard asked, &#34;Did you manage to get the sketchbook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s disdain for Joyce only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lack of prudence was astonishing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had let Alexander into Daniela&#39;s room without hesitation and allowed him to take whatever he wished without batting an eye. Could she really be so ridiculously naive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting her into the Bennett family was as good as inviting burglars to raid their treasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown, Richard sighed deeply. After a moment,he turned back to Alexander, decisiveness in his voice.&#34;Hand over the sketchbook. There&#39;s no need for you to seek out Daniela. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was still preoccupied with the handwriting,racking his brain to recall where he had last seen it,but the memory remained elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the Bennett family pulled away, their car disappearing into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No assurances came from Caiden; his silence said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s cries echoed through the living room, her shoulders trembling with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With frustration evident, Caiden called the driver,who immediately came to pick him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Caiden stepped into the waiting car, Katrina&#39;s voice cut through the air from behind. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paying no mind to Katrina, Caiden waved the driver forward, urging him to start the car and drive off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the rearview mirror, the driver inquired,&#34;Where are we headed, sir?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Caiden muttered, &#34;Elite Lux.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver nodded subtly, pressed the accelerator,and the car sped off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached Elite Lux, droplets began to speckle the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from a banquet, Daniela emerged in a flowing silver-white gown that accentuated her elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A security guard offered her a tissue. With a warm,genuine smile, she accepted, murmuring, &#34;Thank you Her smile reflected a deep, genuine warmth reminiscent of her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of regret washed over Caiden. Realizing his shortcomings as a father over the years, he impulsively swung the car door open and called out,&#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, adorned with long earrings that delicately grazed her cheeks, turned to find Caiden under the somber, drizzly sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hesitated briefly before stepping out, her tone calm and courteous. &#34;Do you need something, Mr.Harper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gazed at her intently, the realization dawning on him that the little girl who once perched on the stairs munching on her meals had blossomed into a poised young woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words came at last, but a slight quiver betrayed his composure. &#34;I remember Katrina used to laugh about how you&#39;d never sit at the table, preferring the stairs instead.Was she right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening air wasn&#39;t particularly brisk, yet Caiden&#39;s words whisked Daniela back to a childhood tinged with solitude. Her smile dimmed a touch as she murmured,&#34;| don&#39;t remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those days, she&#39;d been overlooked, invisible. And now,she was unwilling to entertain belated regrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By holding on to her grudge, she risked being seen as utterly void of compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Josie had prepared a steaming pot of soup,and the ringing of a phone call pierced the quiet night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After disconnecting, Daniela maintained her composure and nodded towards Caiden, her voice steady. &#34;The past is behind us. I&#39;m fortunate now to have people who care about me. Mr. Harper, goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Daniela pivoted and strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, a profound melancholy enveloped Caiden. He watched her receding figure, yearning to call after her, yet she vanished into the distance,beyond reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attempts at reconciliation now seemed futile to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the rain began to fall, the driver unfurled an umbrella over Caiden, who asked in a hushed tone,&#34;Does she still harbor resentment towards me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, a thoughtful man in his fifties, replied cautiously, &#34;Ms. Harper is compassionate by nature.She might be hurt, but at the end of the day, you&#39;re</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her father. Blood ties are enduring, a connection that&#39;s difficult to sever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, choosing his next words carefully. &#34;In some families, emotions aren&#39;t always laid bare immediately, particularly if they wish to avoid stirring up conflict.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden regarded the driver with a hint of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tilting the umbrella against the wind, the driver spoke with quiet conviction. &#34;You see, when someone joins a new family, they tend to tread lightly and avoid stirring trouble. Yet, when they&#39;re among their own family, they&#39;re more inclined to express their true thoughts. Do you know the reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a thoughtful pause, he went on, &#34;It&#39;s because with one&#39;s own family, there&#39;s a greater latitude for openness. With in-laws or outsiders, however, people are more guarded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked over at Caiden, adding,&#34;The same principle applies to your family, Mr. Harper. Observe carefully,and over time, you&#39;ll discern Daniela&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s genuine selves. You&#39;ve ascended the ranks through sheer effort, assuming others have endured similar trials.Yet,human nature is fickle. Ultimately, everyone prioritizes their own interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, having served under Daniela&#39;s mother for many years, had witnessed much and was unafraid to share his insights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the ride home, Caiden was deep in reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina lingered in the living room,awaiting his return.Upon his entry, she offered him a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caiden made his way upstairs, Katrina glanced at the driver with a hint of unease. &#34;Where did he go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm demeanor, the driver responded, &#34;He went to his office, reviewed some documents, then returned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had suspected he might have developed a sudden sense of duty and set off in search of Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out her fears were unfounded.</p>
