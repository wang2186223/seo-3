                <p>Richard was displaying an unusual level of politeness at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s status had changed dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a softer tone than it had in previous days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Lillian&#39;s eye, Richard chuckled and said, &#34;I&#39;ve come here in a complete rush,worried sick. Alexander is concerned too. Yet, it seems Cedric isn&#39;t worried at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian picked up on the subtle insult. It was a clear swipe at Cedric,though it was far from discreet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no desire to engage in a lengthy conversation with Richard and responded briskly, &#34;I get what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ll relay your message to Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then rose to leave. However, after a few steps,she paused and turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before I go, let me offer you some friendly advice.Daniela holds him in high regard and won&#39;t appreciate anyone speaking ill of him. Moreover,she has both the means and the desire to keep him content.&#34; The people at Elite Lux were fiercely protective of their own people. They might criticize Cedric themselves, but external criticism was not welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard remained still for a moment, his mind slowvly catching up as he realized that Lillian was talking about Cedric. His face quickly turned sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried out and dialed Alexander&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Alexander found out Richard was at Elite Lux, he became anxious. &#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you I was still considering it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still considering it? Hackett and his associates are gearing up for a move. If they act, it will lead to an economic showdown nationwide. If it reaches that point, and you&#39;re forced by the business community to choose a side, what then? Fairburne Group&#39;s core business is mining, but you&#39;re expanding into other sectors. You&#39;ve just started making inroads there.What&#39;s your plan if the situation escalates because of Daniela? Cedric doesn&#39;t appear trustworthy, and the same goes for Lillian. Should things take a turn for the worse, they are likely to be the first ones to flee.When that situation arises, it will be just you and Daniela left. Do you genuinely believe you can support her and face the entire world alone? That&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;Alexander remained quiet for an extended period.Undeterred, Richard added, &#34;Lillian brushed off my comments. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll seize another chance to speak with Daniela soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Richard was on the verge of ending the call,Alexander abruptly said, &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, if it comes to that, I will be there for her, and together we will face the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have lost her once before,&#34; Alexander continued.&#34;She ended up with someone else, and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I won&#39;t step back this time.I&#39;m determined to stay by her side, no matter the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard frowned. &#34;Have you lost your senses?Consider all you&#39;ve had to endure to achieve what you currently hold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To secure his position, Alexander faced humiliation and disgrace while associated with Joyce. He had even undergone plastic surgery to make himself look like Cedric.Was he reatly willing to risk everything now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, I&#39;m sorry.&#34; With those words, Alexander disconnected the call.  Richard remained standing, exhaling deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a complicated situation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela&#39;s strategy to expand her influence was progressing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett had mustered the support of the entire business community, readying them for a collective attack on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Richard approached Hackett. &#34;Just grant me a bit more time. I believe I can persuade Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett narrowed his eyes at him. &#34;You&#39;ve had all the opportunities I could offer, and you&#39;ve wasted each one. Daniela&#39;s behavior is so reckless and arrogant. If I don&#39;t put her in her place, she&#39;ll assume we&#39;re all pushovers. She has already provoked considerable outrage,and people are prepared to confront her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard pleaded, &#34;Just give me one hour. I need to speak with Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Richard made his way into Daniela&#39;s office, he found her observing Cedric arrange some flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of breath, the security guard offered an apology to Daniela. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but he was just too quick for us to stop.&#34;Daniela stood up, fixing her gaze on Richard. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard entered with urgency, casting a disapproving look at Cedric. &#34;Daniela, there&#39;s a major issue at hand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with composure, &#34;Are you referring to the matter you discussed with Lillian yesterday? I&#39;m already aware of it and have devised a strategy of my own. I&#39;m puzzled as to why you&#39;re so agitated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard,having rushed up the stairs, caught his breath,and Daniela noticed his effort, which made her tone a bit gentler. Otherwise, she could have easily responded with, &#34;It&#39;s none of your concern. Why are you getting so upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was taken aback, momentarily speechless. He briefly wondered if his concerns were unwarranted.Should he just leave?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; Richard faltered, his earlier urgency deflated by Daniela&#39;s calm demeanor. &#34;Doesn&#39;t this situation worry you? Hackett mentioned that if you continue to acquire companies from the association,they will band together against you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela merely nodded. &#34;So?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was surprised by her casual reaction. &#34;You aren&#39;t worried at all?&#34; &#34;Worried about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The association!&#34; Richard stepped forward. &#34;Are you even aware of what the National Commerce Association entails? There isn&#39;t time to go into depth now, so I&#39;ll simplify it for you. The association is a powerful alliance of individuals each with a net worth of at least ten billion. They combine their resources,connections, and influence to safeguard their collective interests. When one member faces a threat,they unite to confront the challenge as a united front.&#34;</p>
