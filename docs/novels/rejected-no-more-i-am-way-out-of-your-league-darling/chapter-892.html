                <p>Carol&#39;s brow shot up. &#34;Wait, Daniela. Are you seriously telling me Hamilton wasn&#39;t involved in your mom&#39;s death? That sounds pretty far-fetched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle sharpness crept into Daniela&#39;s gaze. &#34;But the other shareholders of McCoy Group were responsible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It clicked for Carol right away. &#34;So, you&#39;re gunning for the whole McCoy Group? But Hamilton&#39;s aligned with McCoy Group, which means he&#39;s one of your targets as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret that Hamilton had practically built McCoy Group from the ground up. The recording even claimed he&#39;d given up almost everything, including his own family, to get where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela set her sights on McCoy Group, Hamilton was bound to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged, her voice nonchalant. &#34;Guess I&#39;ll have to say sorry in advance for whatever&#39;s coming,&#34;she said, not bothering to look the least bit sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Hamilton hadn&#39;t been directly involved, he was still in charge, and now that the chaos had reached him, there was no escaping responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me something, Daniela. When are you planning on taking back the &#39;world&#39;s wealthiest&#39; title?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Daniela answered, &#34;Get our projects moving. Cedric can oversee everything.Give me a month, and I&#39;ll be back on top.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;And after that, you&#39;re taking the fight to McCoy Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s answer came without hesitation. &#34;That&#39;s the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of slow blinks was all Carol managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela noticed Carol&#39;s expression and let out a laugh. &#34;What&#39;s up? Got something on your mind?&#34; Carol leaned in, lowering her voice. &#34;Nikolas actually owns a pretty sizable chunk of shares in McCoy Group,you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grinned even wider. &#34;Just Nikolas? Last I checked, there&#39;s another McCoy living under our roof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Carol. &#34;Mind if I give him a little warning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By all means,&#34; Daniela replied, perfectly unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol paused, second-guessing herself. &#34;If Nikolas reacts, though, it could tip Hamilton off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela met Carol&#39;s uncertainty with a reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lighthearted shrug, Carol dismissed her own worries. &#34;Forget it, he&#39;s busy with his own company now.I doubt it really matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on to Carol&#39;s thoughts immediately, Daniela broke into laughter. &#34;So what you&#39;re really saying is you&#39;re rich, and whatever happens to his shares isn&#39;t your problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s lauighter filled the room, not even trying to deny it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, Daniela&#39;s people never worried about cash flow. If anything, money was always the least of their problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From there, Daniela handed the responsibility to Cedric to handle business operations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One month down the line, Daniela had reclaimed her title as the world&#39;s wealthiest person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could quite believe what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Cedric was left speechless for a moment, though he, unlike the public, understood exactly what led to their victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To those on the outside, Cedric seemed like the genius behind Daniela&#39;s meteoric rise and Hamilton&#39;s fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew exactly how Daniela had managed to reclaim the crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So all this time, you were just keeping your true wealth a secret?&#34; Cedric turned to Daniela, unable to hide his awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on him just how remarkable his wife truly was, and for a split second, he was at a loss what to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Daniela replayed the recording for Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught on right away. &#34;You&#39;re planning to go after McCoy Group, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say more, Nikolas and Damon stepped into the room. Whatever congratulations they had for Daniela faded as they overheard Cedric&#39;s question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t bother with secrets. She looked at them both and said, &#34;If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll start unloading your McCoy shares now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas and Damon stared at her in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Challenging Hamilton was something they&#39;d never imagined Daniela would actually do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stepped forward, concern written all over his face. &#34;Daniela, you have no idea what my father&#39;s capable of. He&#39;s turned hopeless situations around more times than I can count. He&#39;s got years of experience, doesn&#39;t mind playing dirty, and when he decides to get serious, he&#39;s a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept his thoughts to himself, silently taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon pressed on, his worry plain as day. &#34;And don&#39;t forget where you are-this is Oiscoll, and the McCoy family basically runs things here. You knocked my father off his perch as the world&#39;s richest today, and you&#39;d better believe his furious. If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas chimed in, &#34;Going up against him isn&#39;t just another business rivalry. Over the years, plenty of powerful people have tried to take him down, but every single one failed. You won&#39;t be an exception.&#34;</p>
