                <p>Richard let out a faint smile. &#34;Respect and admiration are what give the president of the commerce association real power. But if the entire industry resents them, then what&#39;s the point? When Alexander wanted to join, you shut him out without hesitation.And now, when trouble comes knocking,you turn to us. Do you really think we&#39;re stupid enough to make an enemy out of Daniela just for a title?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Richard had nearly been swayed. He had even sought out Alexander&#39;s opinion, but after Alexander had analyzed the situation thoroughly, he had been furious. These people were looking for a scapegoat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Richard, you&#39;re reading too much into this. The association is a force to be reckoned with. Why would we be afraid of Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; Richard scoffed. &#34;Then why the sudden generosity? Don&#39;t take me for a fool-I know exactly what&#39;s got you all rattled. Get lost! I have nothing more to say to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard was about to kick them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett stepped forward. &#34;Richard, thisis all just a  misunderstanding. How about this? When Alexander has time, we&#39;ll sit down and talk face-to-face. Would that work for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s brows pulled together in a deep frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett smoothly pushed the check and gift back into Richard&#39;s hands. &#34;We came here sincerely, after all.And let&#39;s be honest-holding a position of power comes with challenges. Otherwise,how would anyone respect it? We&#39;re not asking you to go against Daniela,just to have Alexander mediate. She&#39;s young, and being so combative won&#39;t do her any favors in the long run, right? I won&#39;t deny it-Daniela&#39;s capable.Right now, we can&#39;t match her. But luck doesn&#39;t last forever, does it? Just let Alexander know. Have him meet with us. And if you&#39;re still uneasy, then at least keep the gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett was nothing if not calculated. Richard was completely outmaneuvered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hackett&#39;s remark, Richard fell silent for a moment before muttering, &#34;Wait here. I need to make a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped aside, phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno narrowed his eyes. &#34;Hackett, why does Alexander always keep such a low profile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey nodded in agreement. &#34;Yeah, he didn&#39;t even show up at the last press conference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s brow furrowed slightly. &#34;Now that you mention it, it is strange. Didn&#39;t Richard say Alexander went missing? Then suddenly he turned up, and not long after, Bennett Group merged with Fairburne Group.But Joyce has vanished without a trace. None of it adds up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow cast a sharp glance at Richard, who was speaking in hushed tones over the phone. &#34;Look into him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Richard returned, his phone still in hand. &#34;Sorry, Alexander&#39;s schedule is packed. He said he&#39;ll discuss with you some other time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett smiled faintly, slipping his own phone back into his pocket. &#34;Oh? Alexander is too busy to meet?I wonder what&#39;s keeping him so occupied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;What exactly are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett tilted his head slightly. &#34;Fairburne Group belonged to Joyce, didn&#39;t it? But now she&#39;s gone, and out of nowhere, all her shares fall into Alexander&#39;s hands.That company is massive-it controls a fortune in mineral resources. Hard to believe Joyce would just hand it over out of the goodness of her heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s face darkened. Hackett&#39;s smile didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Well, since you won&#39;t help us, I suppose we&#39;ll have some free time to investigate Joyce&#39;s disappearance instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s anger froze on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eight men across from him saw everything clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s tone was ice-cold. &#34;I suggest you bring Alexander out. We&#39;re not interested in digging into Joyce&#39;s situation-we just want to talk. There&#39;s no need for him to act so secretive, is there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s patience was wearing thin. &#34;Fine! I&#39;ll call him right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and dialed Alexander&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call connected, Hackett snatched the phone straight from Richard&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, let&#39;s meet. Your position isn&#39;t solid yet,and going against the association might not be the wisest move for Bennett Group, don&#39;t you think?Besides, we mean no harm-just a conversation. If things don&#39;t go well, we won&#39;t force the issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against Daniela, they didn&#39;t dare raise their voices, but when it came to Alexander, Hackett still carred an air of arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few seconds, the other end of the line was completely silent. Then came a cold,measured voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow night at eight. Lynklee Cafe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call cut off. Richard shot a furious glare at the eight men in front of him. &#34;Would you even dare to go up against Daniela? She crushed every single one of you,and now, with nowhere left to run, you crawl to Alexander? What a bunch of damn cowards!&#34; His rage boiled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, unfazed, gave a composed smile. &#34;If you want someone to blame, blame Daniela for being too powerful. If she weren&#39;t, we wouldn&#39;t be scrambling for solutions. But don&#39;t worry-we have no intention of harming Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after suffering heavy losses at Daniela&#39;s hands,the association&#39;s eight most powerful companies still had plenty of influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And among them, Hackett held the most sway-his authority wasfar from diminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the group was about to disperse, Winslow suddenly muttered, &#34;Did you notice? Alexander&#39;s voice on the phone-it sounded familiar. Like someone we&#39;ve met recently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others barely paid attention. &#34;Who else could it be? It&#39;s just Alexander. We&#39;ve heard his voice before,  so of course, it sounds familiar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,they scattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was reviewing the latest designs when her phone vibrated with a message from Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The association wants to meet me. Seems like they&#39;re looking to back me as the new president. How should I coordinate with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the message but didn&#39;t bother replying,focusing instead on the documents in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, her phone rang. It was Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Daniela ignored the call and blocked the number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, an unknown number popped up on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still flipping through the files, she answered, &#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,did you see my message?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers turned another page. &#34;Alexander, I thought I made myself clear before. Whatever&#39;s going on with you-it has nothing to do with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela spoke, Nina and Lillian were off to the side,chatting and laughing. &#34;Is Daniela preparing for pregnancy? Cedric&#39;s been working out every day and  eating double portions. Are they trying for a baby?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, Daniela ended the call and blocked the number.</p>
