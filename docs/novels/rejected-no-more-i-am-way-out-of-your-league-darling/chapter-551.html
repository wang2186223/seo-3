                <p>Alexander stood rooted to the spot, his face a mask of shock and disbelief. His mind was a complete blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t believe what he had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was preparing for pregnancy? And she and Cedric were trying for a baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been working so hard to draw nearer to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela. How could she possibly yearn for a childwith another? Why couldn&#39;t she wait for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be Cedric! Cedric must be pressuring Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through Alexander, his hands balling into fists so tight his nails nearly pierced the skin. He wanted nothing more than for Cedric to be gone-permanently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Cedric was gone, there would be no other-just him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was even prepared to sacrifice his own life for Daniela-provided she reciprocated his love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At dusk, Alexander&#39;s face bore an expression of grim resolve. The following morning, Alexander arrived at the designated meeting spot for his appointment with the eight members of the commerce association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A partition separated them; Alexander seated on one side and the group of eight on the opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett peeked over repeatedly, puzzled by Alexander&#39;s motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weren&#39;t they here to engage in conversation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was any meaningful discussion possible with that barrier in place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group exchanged baffled looks, shrugging at Alexander&#39;s odd conduct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela,they had at least been able to see her face.Was Alexander trying to surpass her in aloofness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me. I&#39;ve been under the weather recently and prefer not to be seen. Just speak freely,&#34; Alexander said firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett and the others were unconcerned with his absence of visibility; the business at hand was their priority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They settled into their chairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow glanced at the partition, a familiar sensation  returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, we propose to nominate you as the president of ourassociation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s response was cold. &#34;And what benefit do I derive from accepting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Hackett opened his mouth to speak, Alexander preempted him, his voice dripping with disdain.&#34;Merely a title? And you expect me to spearhead your battles? Do you truly consider me that naive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s expression darkened, his forehead creasing with a mixture of anger and disbelief. &#34;Alexander,how can you speak such words? Have you forgotten that your ascent was only made possible through the doors we unlocked for you? How can you display such blatant ingratitude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sardonic laugh escaped Alexander&#39;s lips. &#34;Oh really?Doors you claim to have opened? Let&#39;s be clear-wasn&#39;t it rather that you failed to stand up to Daniela,found yourselves financially shackled, and unable to pursue other interests, which left the field open for me to capitalize on the opportunities you missed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bruno&#39;s response caught in his throat, his cheeks flushing with suppressed fury as he struggled to articulate his frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey narrowed his eyes slightly. &#34;Alexander,  remember the time you were eager to join our association? I commanded you. Despite the outcome not being favorable, I always treated you with fairness,did I not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander nodded. &#34;Indeed, you did. Yet, let&#39;s not overlook the outrageous fifty million you charged for that introduction, promising me a lucrative spot within the association. And what was the outcome? My money evaporated, and the promised membership turned to dust. I was left out of the loop during the profitable times; I certainly have no intention of sharing in the losses now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander&#39;s final words hung in the air, the tension in the room became palpable, and one by one,everyone stood, their bodies rigid with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, curb your arrogance!&#34; Marcus exploded,his voice resonant with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing a finger sharply at the screen, Bruno cursed,&#34;Alexander, such ungratefulness is beneath you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden crash rang out as the coffee cup smashed against the floor, splintering into shards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice cut through the air, cold and sharp.&#34;Who is the ungrateful one here? Remember, you&#39;re the ones seeking my assistance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, frustration contorted their faces on the  other side, their expressions tightening with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett rose slowly, his voice deliberate. &#34;There&#39;s no benefit in dwelling on old grievances. You must have some strategy since you agreed to this meeting.What&#39;s on your mind? Surely, you aren&#39;t inclined to let Daniela take control of everything, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Hackett was mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander harbored no objections to Daniela holding sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Daniela&#39;s vast wealth was destined to merge with his eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was all for Daniela ascending to power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was an exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He harbored a deep-seated desire for Cedric to fail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, he wanted nothing more than for Cedric to take his last breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of loathing briefly crossed Alexander&#39;s gaze,and he paused, collecting his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, reclining slightly in his chair, he stated, &#34;I have no interest in presiding over the association,nor do l wish to participate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Huey nearly burst with anger,Hackett restrained him. &#34;Then what do you suggest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allow me to offer a piece of advice,&#34; Alexander stated, his tone even and measured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett&#39;s gaze darkened, his eyes sharpening with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Alexander genuinely afford such generosity as a businessman? Ultimately, he refused to confront Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander stated firmly, &#34;Daniela is out of your league.Trying to take her down is futile and won&#39;t get you anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett asked, &#34;Then what&#39;s our move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander replied, &#34;Strike at her weak spots. What is Daniela&#39;s current priority? Target that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence enveloped Hackett at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander explained, &#34;Cedric is her vulnerability.Phillips Group is thriving, but with all eight of you united,you can still pose a threat. When push comes to shove, Daniela will undoubtedly rush to Cedric&#39;s side, which will give you a chance to negotiate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s voice was steady. &#34;Remember, if you can control Cedric, you can control Daniela. She may be tough,managing businesses that are lucrative and fast -growing, eclipsing the older, established industries.  Yet, Phillips Group isn&#39;t as formidable as her company.If you&#39;re looking for an escape, Cedric is your key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room began to ease as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett hesitated. &#34;But what if Daniela intervenes to support him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander let out a sly chuckle. &#34;Once or twice might not count,but if she continually bails him out, Cedric&#39;s ego will take a hit, and he&#39;ll inevitably clash with Daniela. Being seen as weak and dependent on a woman will only bring him scorn. That tension could drive them apart, giving you some breathing space.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group nodded, taking in the strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow asked, &#34;And if Daniela strikes back later,aren&#39;t we back where we started?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Alexander responded coldly,&#34;Cross that bridge when you come to it. If you can&#39;t handle your current troubles and all eight of you go under, don&#39;t point fingers at me for seizing an opportunity.&#34;</p>
