                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice was as soft as a whisper, yet her words hit Elyse and Natalie like a thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their stunned expressions didn&#39;t escape her notice.andshe allowedherself afaintsmile.&#34;What?Surprised?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference between suspecting something and hearing it confirmed with such candidness was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse broke the silence with a chuckle and asked, &#34;So,does this mean you&#39;re planning to settle down with Cedric soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was calm and unwavering.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Cedric had married long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse exhaled in visible relief. &#34;Since you&#39;re not interested in settling down with Cedric,why not let Nina have him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter was light, almost dismissive.&#34;Oh?Nina doesn&#39;t mind that I&#39;ve been involved with Cedric?How generous of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse waved her hand as if brushing off the remark. &#34;lf Nina manages to get the man you&#39;ve discarded, she should count herself lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment drew a slight frown from Daniela, and her tone grew cold, the warmth fading entirely.&#34;Cedric is a great person. He&#39;s not a man l&#39;ve discarded. Now, if there&#39;s nothing else, I have work to do.You should leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s voice softened as she asked,&#34;What about Nina and Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s answer was clipped and firm. &#34;I&#39;ve already said, it&#39;s a personal matter. Whether Cedric takes a liking to Nina depends entirely on her. Asking me won&#39;t change anything. Now,please see yourself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse left, her cheerful smile betraying no offense taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, Natalie whispered, &#34;Mom, see? I told you, but you didn&#39;t believe me. Daniela really isn&#39;t interested in Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s carefully laid plan to use Cedric to unnerve Daniela crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela appeared utterly unbothered, her calm demeanor betraying no possessiveness over Cedric whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then call off the professional killers sent after Cedric. Redirect their focus to Daniela. Her assets are multiplying rapidly. By the end of the year, they&#39;ll reach their peak. Bring in the hypnotist to hypnotize her, and by New Year&#39;s, have her sign a will leaving everything to me. After that, let her meet the same end as Brylee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gave a curt nod and said, &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll take care of it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started to leave but hesitated after a few steps.Turning back, she asked reluctantly, &#34;What about Cedric? Are we really going to let Nina have him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse exhaled slowly and asked, &#34;Do you honestly have feelings for Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie nodded.&#34;I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse fell silent for a moment before asking, &#34;Even if it meant giving up Daniela&#39;s billion-dollar fortune,would you still want him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t falter as she replied, &#34;I would.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse relayed Natalie&#39;s intentions to Nina later that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected Nina to agree without question,but instead, Nina rejected the idea outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so special about Cedric?&#34; Elyse asked. &#34;He barely even smiles when he&#39;s around you two. What could you possibly see in him?&#34; Nina&#39;s expression softened as a dreamy look crossed her face. &#34;Mom, you don&#39;t get it. He&#39;s been my dream since I was young. I wouldn&#39;t trade him for anything.Tomorrow&#39;s chance to teach Cedric how to make pastries is mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse frowned, her voice turning cold. &#34;With money,you could have any man you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shook her head, a lovesick smile tugging at her lips. &#34;But there&#39;s only one Cedric in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Elyse sided with Natalie. The next morning,she locked Nina inside the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie prepared for the meeting with a surge of confidence. Hugging Elyse before she left, she said,&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Mom. Today, I&#39;ll win Cedric over with my charm!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded firmly and gave the man beside her a slight push, directing him towards Natalie. &#34;If Cedric stays unyielding, take him along. He&#39;ll assist in hypnotizing Cedric, ensuring you can capture his heart effortlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gave a determined nod. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stood silently on the second-floor balcony, her gaze fixed on the driveway as Natalie drove off with the hypnotist. Her hands gripped the cold metal railing so tightly her knuckles turned white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was everyone determined to go against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why, just when she had glimpsed a sliver of hope, did it have to vanish so cruelly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears of anger and helplessness rolled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seethed with resentment towards Natalie and Elyse for stealing everything that was supposed to be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, meanwhile, headed to the meeting with unwavering confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the drive, she repeatedly sought reassurance from the hypnotist, her tone edged with urgency.&#34;Your techniques are perfected, right? There won&#39;t be any harm to his body, will there? This is the man I want to spend my entire life with. I can&#39;t bear the thought of causing him pain-not even a scratch.Make sure it&#39;s safe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before stepping in, Natalie stopped and issued a precise instruction. &#34;Don&#39;t hypnotize him yet. Wait for my signal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down,she wanted to try winning Cedric over on her own first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she could charm him without needing any tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t an impossible dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened her outfit, smoothed her hair, and entered with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a cozy little pastry shop. As she stepped inside with a radiant smile, a man with a neatly trimmed beard walked towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello. Are you the instructor teaching rose pastries?I&#39;m Leo.&#34;</p>
