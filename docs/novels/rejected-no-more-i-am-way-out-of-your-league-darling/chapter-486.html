                <p>Events unfolded just as the secretary and the driver had predicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cedric approached, Lillian locked the door to Elite Lux. She also posted a notice on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Printed boldly on the paper that said, &#34;Cedric Phillips is prohibited from entering!&#34; Accompanying the text was a high-resolution image of Cedric, recently printed by Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both the secretary and the driver were speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was in a panic. &#34;Lillian, is Daniela ill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian crossed her arms, her gaze cold and firm.&#34;Cedric, stop avoiding the issue. Get ready for the divorce agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was taken aback, feeling as if the earth had shifted under his feet. His secretary and driver were just as shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on a moment. Isn&#39;t this going a bit far? A divorce? Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was absolutely ridiculouIS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;divorce&#34; made Cedric&#39;s entire body stiffen. He looked at Lillian intently, took a deep breath, and asked, &#34;Is this divorce your idea, or Daniela&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression remained unreadable. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter who brought it up. The divorce is happening.Tomorrow, when the lawyers are back, you&#39;ll receive the divorce agreement. At the same time, we will cut all business relations with Phillips Group.&#34; She then turned to the security chief, whose confusion was clear. &#34;Starting now, no one from Phillips Group is allowed to enter. We are cutting all ties with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Cedric&#39;s secretary became visibly distressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! This has all been a big misunderstanding!&#34; The secretary was taken aback by the intense reactions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from those at Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all because Cedric had brought a celebrity to a minor charity event. How could it lead to the point of ending both business relations and a marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is going too far!&#34; the secretary exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Cedric appeared unconcerned about the business consequences. His focus remained entirely on Lillian as he continued to ask, &#34;Is Daniela sick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood firm, her expression unreadable. &#34;Her condition does not concern you. We will handle it ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then looked towards Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s face was just as stern, and he remained silent for the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s more to discuss, wve can address it later.Right now, I need to know if Daniela is okay. Please,let me in. I admit, I was not thinking straight tonight.If you want to punish me, I accept that. But I&#39;m really concerned about her. Just let me see her for a  moment. If she&#39;s alright,I&#39;ll leave right away. Can we agree on that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who typically kept a composed and detached air, was visibly agitated. Tonight, however, he displayed an unusual humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan glanced at Lillian, her expression as hard and unmovable as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, Ryan said, &#34;You should leave. We&#39;ll take care of any issues. Daniela is already resting,and your presence would only disturb her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &#34;Is she really unwell?&#34;o</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words triggered a strong wave of guilt in Cedric, clenching his heart tightly. In a soft voice,he pleaded with Ryan, &#34;Please, let me in. I&#39;ll be quiet, I promise.Just a quick look. I won&#39;t leave until I&#39;m sure she&#39;s okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan realized that even if Cedric saw Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t be able to leave reassured. He glanced briefly at Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Lillian grabbed a chair and shoved it against the door. &#34;Fine. If you&#39;re determined to get in, you&#39;ll have to go over my dead body!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan understood then that Lillian was truly enraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically carefree, Lillian rarely took matters to heart,except when they crossed a critical line. And that line was Daniela&#39;s well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Lillian&#39;s perspective, Daniela&#39;s depression had been kept under control up until now. Despite Alexander&#39;s previous actions, Daniela had managed to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cedric had a unique impact on Daniela&#39;s emotional well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made Lillian realize Cedric was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was determined to remove his influence as soon as possible.</p>
