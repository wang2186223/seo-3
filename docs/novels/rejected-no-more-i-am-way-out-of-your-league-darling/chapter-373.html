                <p>Nina uncorked the bottle of wine with a practiced ease that spoke of experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cedric could even furrow his brows, she had already filled the glasses and set them neatly in front of him and Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s alcohol tolerance had been honed deliberately,so much so that saying she could outdrink almost anyone wasn&#39;t far from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Cedric, for their part, were no strangers to holding their liquor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s tongue loosened as the alcohol worked its magic. With a mischievous grin,he turned to Nina as she took her seat. &#34;So, are you into Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina ducked her head, her lips curling into a bashful smile as a blush bloomed across her cheeks. &#34;Oh,don&#39;t say that! If Daniela hears, she&#39;ll be upset. Besides,someone like Cedric is way out of my league.He&#39;s like a star shining high in the heavens, and I&#39;m just a tiny speck of dust on the earth-completely unworthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, Nina&#39;s eyes flickered up ever so briefly, her gaze resting on Cedric&#39;s lips. The sight sent a soft flutter through her chest. Cedric remained largely quiet, his silence only fueling the quiet adoration blooming in Nina&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to hold his attention, she worked tirelessly to find topics of conversation, all while skillfully refilling their glasses without drawing notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, brooding and moody, continued to drink with little hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan matched him drink for drink, and despite Nina having made threetrips downstairs to fetch more wine,neither man seemed remotely affected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re out of wine?&#34; Ryan asked, casting a glance at the collection of empty bottles littering the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s it,&#34; Nina said, spreading her hands in mock defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had hoped Ryan would take the hint and leave,but instead, Cedric rose to his feet and said, &#34;If we&#39;re out,you two should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Cedric&#39;s words, Nina quickly jumped in. &#34;Oh, wait! I just remembered-l&#39;ve got a bottle of excellent vintage at home. You two stay put, and I&#39;ll bring it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Nina pulled out her phone and dialed Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Cedric actually drank your wine?&#34; Nina&#39;s voice brimmed with excitement. &#34;Yes! They&#39;re upstairs right now, waiting for it. Mom, you still have those century-old bottles, right? Please send someone to bring them over. After tonight, Cedric will be mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse sounded doubtful. &#34;Are you sure Cedric actually asked for your wine, or is this just your idea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, Nina shot back, &#34;Mom, what&#39;s thatsupposed to mean? You&#39;ve always thought Natalie is better than me. Do you really think Cedric should just sit around and wait for her to come back instead of noticing me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse stiffened,realizing Nina had read her thoughts perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s voice turned shaky, tinged with tears. &#34;I&#39;m not asking you to favor me over anyone. I just want a little fairness. It&#39;s just a few bottles of wine. Can&#39;t you give them to me? Natalie&#39;s incredible, I get that, but I&#39;m not any less! I&#39;ll prove to you that, for Cedric, I&#39;m the only one who matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse sighed, clicking her tongue. &#34;Look at you-getting all worked up when I&#39;ve barely said anything.Fine, fine. It&#39;s just a few bottles of wine. I&#39;ll have someone send them over. You&#39;re my daughter, after all. Give it half an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the call ended. Nina stayed downstairs, waiting impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt not a shred of gratitude towards Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was well aware Elyse had only caved because she feared Cedric might actually take an interest in her.A few bottles of wine were hardly a sacrifice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to Elyse&#39;s word, the wine arrived exactly half an hour later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina stepped into the elevator, deliberately movig at a slow pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Ryan and Cedric had downed a fair amount.Nina knew some people only felt the effects after a delay, and when it hit, it hit hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped Ryan was one of those delayed ty/pes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ryan passed out, she intended to stride in with the wine and murmur sweet, carefully chosen words into Cedric&#39;s ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, there was no way Cedric could resist her charm.</p>
