                <p>As the official was poised to stamp the marriage certificate, Daniela turned to Cedric. &#34;We need to keep this under our hats for the time being.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a subtle nod, his eyes tracking the official&#39;s movements, and gestured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seal pressed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at him, dazed. &#34;You once mentioned sharing a bed someday. But I get to set the pace-you promised.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s demeanor was easygoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grasping the marriage certificate firmly, he tucked it securely into his suit pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he take Daniela&#39;s hand in his,telling her, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll dance to your tune, honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, the sun blazed down with unusual fervor. As Cedric led Daniela out, her mind was a whirlwind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Married,just like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The expression on her face was indescribable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time she was married, she had chased Alexander for a decade, only to see the marriage dissolve after just one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she hadn&#39;t even dated Cedric properly, yet here they were, hitched in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela turned to look at Cedric and saw his smile, a flicker of pity crossed her gaze. Did he truly grasp what he had signed up for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want our marriage to be a secret,&#34; Daniela reminded him, clutching at the remnants of her rationality. She needed it secret until she could avenge her mother&#39;s death. She wouldn&#39;t let her guard down, nor put Cedric at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela thought she must be losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had her life turned into such a whirlwind? Love had never been in the blueprint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos reigned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s smile was bright, almost boyish, as if he had conquered the globe. &#34;In private, may I call you honey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had been down the aisle twice already. Yet,the term still felt alien on her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric seemed comfortable with &#34;honey,&#34; as if it had always been part of his vocabulary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that alright,honey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;Fine, do as you wish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes sparkled. &#34;Then let&#39;s toast to this. How about a lavish meal to celebrate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, and Cedric whisked her away to the Night Lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The going rate at the Night Lounge was fifty thousand per head. Calling a waiter over, Cedric said,&#34;My wife isn&#39;t keen on spicy food or ginger. Any suggestions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips pursed in slight embarrassment.There was no need to hammer it home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter, caught off guard and almost giddy with the news of his boss&#39;s impromptu wedding,seemed ready to burst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave the waiter a stern look, adding in a grave tone, &#34;We&#39;re keeping this low-key for now, so hold the fanfare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wondered if silence was possible when Cedric kept broadcasting it like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter, nearly keeling over from the revelation,saw the restaurant manager approach, all smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, Mr. Philips. As your manager, it&#39;s my honor to serve you and your wife personally. Why not try the steak today? It&#39;s particularly good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela opened her mouth to speak, but Cedric interjected, &#34;My wife isn&#39;t a fan of steak.&#34; &#34;Understood,&#34; the manager replied with a polite nod.&#34;How about our seafood casserole then? The ingredients are top-notch today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not into shellfish either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager nodded again. &#34;Noted. We can customize it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric scrutinized the menu closely. &#34;It includes bacon, right? She&#39;s not fond of that either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager&#39;s smile didn&#39;t waver. &#34;No problem,we&#39;ll leave it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric continued to peruse the menu with an eagle eye, while the manager kept up a facade of calm but was internally baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Cedric been married before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why all this fuss over a meal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had designed the menu himself, hadn&#39;t he? So why this meticulous inspection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To an outside, it could appear as though this wasn&#39;t even Cedric&#39;s own restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela also felt Cedric was being overly meticulous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the verge of speaking up when he suddenly stood, smoothly took off his suit jacket,shook it out, and hung it neatly on the back of his chair. HHe turned to her and said warmly, &#34;Just wait here for me. I&#39;ll cook for you on our first day as husband and wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was already on his way to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager tucked the menu away and leaned in.&#34;Madam, would you care for a drink? Our boss has a few rare bottles stashed away, each a small fortune now. Shall we open one to celebrate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to decline, but Cedric reappeared,donning an apron. &#34;Open the most expensive one.lt has a fruity undertone you&#39;ll appreciate, Daniela.I bought it thinking of you. Go ahead, try it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s culinary skills were exceptional. He rested his chin in his hand, watching her reaction closely.&#34;So,how is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they had registered their marriage, Cedric&#39;s smile hadn&#39;t faded. Seeing his unabated cheer,Daniela found herself smiling back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s delicious,&#34; she admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll make it for you every day/,&#34; Cedric declared,his tone affectionate as if rehearsed many times over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t protest. She didn&#39;t believe Cedric would hold to his word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long cultivated a practice of not relying on others&#39; promises. That way, disappointment was less likely to sting.</p>
