                <p>Richard narrowed his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t hold back. Just be straight with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life with Daniela meant a future dripping with opulence and affluence, yet it demanded a sacrifice of his own moral compass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go down this road, and you&#39;ll be just another spineless lapdog, like those pathetic losers drooling over Daniela-gutless and the butt of everyone&#39;s jokes. Yet, behind the facade of derision, life would be sweet. Moreover, when she&#39;s gone, even a tiny slice of her fortune would ensure you live in luxury,much like Caiden did,&#34; Richard muttered. &#34;But if you&#39;re the one to die first, everything you&#39;ve done will be meaningless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed his gaze on Alexander, his expression serious. &#34;This one&#39;s on you. Only you can decide. If you want to be with Daniela, remember, Bennett Group will be relegated to a life of modesty.&#34; Society often viewed a man dependent on a woman&#39;s wealth as devoid of independence and drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard muttered a string of curses under his breath,seething at Daniela&#39;s heartless, manipulative bullshit.Yet, the allure of inheriting tens of billions was no trivial matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of temptation that could break even the strongest resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a troubled frown, Richard rubbed his hands together and turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chance encounter with Daniela while shopping was unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In days gone by, Richard would haughtily await Daniela&#39;s lavish praises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the sight of Daniela, a vision of sophistication in her designer clothes and shimmering pearl earrings,made his heart skip a beat in apprehension, debating whether to approach and offer flattering words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers swirled that Daniela&#39;s unassuming pearlearrings alone boasted a value exceeding eighty million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard mustered a smile, preparing to exchange pleasantries with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she breezed right past him without a sideways glance, her entourage of mall staff in tow,rendering him, her former father-in-law, utterly invisible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of displeasure crossed Richard&#39;s face instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Daniela considering a reconciliation with Alexander? It seemed quite the contrary; she appeared to want nothing to do with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Richard couldn&#39;t help but ponder-if Alexander were to marry into the Harper family, he&#39;d become one of them. How would he maintain his pride when interacting with Daniela? Would he be forced to greet her with a smile only to be snubbed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought sent a shiver through Richard,hastening his steps towards home. Meanwhile, Daniela continued her tour of the store.Lillian cast a glance her way, curiosity tinged her voice. &#34;Daniela, didn&#39;t you notice Richard back there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Daniela responded with a dismissive shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nodded, a trace of relief in her tone. &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve finally snapped out of that obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had feared Daniela might approach Richard,addressing him with undue reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought had left her anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light chuckle, Daniela brushed off the concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pressed on, her voice laced with intrigue.&#34;If Alexander sacrifices his dignity and chooses to be with you, would you truly accept him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela surveyed the store, she shook her head and declared, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian turned to her with a puzzled look. &#34;Why not?&#34; Daniela responded, &#34;Alexander will never relinquish control of Bennett Group. His pride wouldn&#39;t allow it.He can&#39;t stand the thought of the gossip that would follow if he married into another family to save face.His pride, believe it or not, outweighs his own interests. Even if he were to agree, it&#39;d be because he harbors some hope that l&#39;d pass away soon,allowing him to inherit everything. If he doesn&#39;t marry me, he gains nothing from the deal. He&#39;s not the type to take such a risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the years, Daniela had pieced together the essence of Alexander&#39;s character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized his egotism, his aloofness, and the way he masqueraded as a man of virtue while his actions were guided solely by self-interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was a master at playing the part of the stoic,immovable hero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just you wat,&#34; Daniela asserted with a hint of certainty. &#34;Alexander will most certainly make an appearance at the bidding.&#34; On the day of the bidding, as Daniela and Lillian entered the venue, there was no sign of Alexander yet. However, Cedric was unexpectedly present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising an eyebrow, Lillian queried, &#34;I thought you were determined to stay out of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time Daniela had paid him for the project,Cedric had been visibly mortified for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to participate. I&#39;m merely here to observe, to set my mind at ease,&#34; Cedric replied,seated beside Daniela. &#34;Leave it to me, Daniela.I&#39;l supervise for free. I do have the experience, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot back, &#34;Cedric, is watching others get rich your weird little kink? I offered you this job once,and you declined. Now you show up offering to supervise for free? What are you playing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Cedric extended a thermos towards Daniela. &#34;Skip the mineral water today; it&#39;s chilly out. Have something warm instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughtful actions almost painted him as a nurturing figure, sparking the question of why he&#39;d fuss over such small details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling parched, Daniela gratefully took a few sips from the thermos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the bidding meeting commenced, Daniela confidently stepped onto the stage to address the gathering. However, her attention was diverted as a figure slipped through the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The newcomer, with head bowed and shoulders hunched, quietly made their way to the last row and seated themselves discreetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze turned to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Daniela&#39;s look, Lillian glanced back and recognized the latecomer as Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of defeat washed over her. Betting against Daniela had been a terrible call, and now she was stuck owing her ten grand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy heart, Lillian transferred the money to Daniela, her mood visibly dampened as she slumped back in her chair. Maynard Group and Phillips Group had unexpectedly pulled out of the running, leaving two lucrative construction sites available. The potential profits were so immense; everyone&#39;s eyes were on the prize,dreaming of securing a fortune that could sustain their families for generations to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated among the audience, Alexander&#39;s determination hardened as Daniela declared the integration of the construction of the two pieces of land into a single project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his view, nothing could rival the allureof wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching his pen, his resolve was palpable.</p>
