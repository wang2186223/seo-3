                <p>&#34;What&#39;s all the commotion about? Why is it so packed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words were uttered, the buyer&#39;s pen hovered motionless above the contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his haste, Caiden grabbed the buyer&#39;s hand,attempting to make him sign, but the buyer shoved him away without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence settled over the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gaze snapped to the figure stepping out of Elite Lux,stunned into disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the live reporters were momentarily speechless,their words caught in their throats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela emerged from Elite Lux, it felt like a moment pulled straight from three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden leaned in urgently. &#34;Mr. Bradley, don&#39;t be fooled! This isn&#39;t the real Daniela. Trust me-sign the contract now, and I&#39;ll even throw in two more benefits.Just sign! Daniela&#39;s wealth is mine; I have the right to deal with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he finished, Caiden was practically trembling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath came in ragged bursts, fury surging through him like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why now,of all times?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been on the brink of unimaginable fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was mere moments away from securing his place among the wealthy elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Daniela have to show up now? Why did she always show up just to wreck everything he was so close to getting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t Daniela just stay dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t she supposed to be gone forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why had she come back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Caiden&#39;s mind teetered on the edge of madness. His furious glare locked onto Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned to face the cameras, her voice steady.&#34;Hello, everyone. I&#39;m Daniela Harper, and I&#39;m back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all she said. Nothing more, nothing less.And yet those few words obliterated everything Caiden had built over the last three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why? Why did she always pull him from the heights of victory straight into the depths of ruin so effortlessly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood amidst the crowd, the glare of countless spotlights reflecting off her, unshaken and untouchable like nothing in the world could break her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate your time today.&#34; Daniela spoke with cool authority. &#34;Elite Lux will continue running as usual-there are no plans to sell. As for my estate,it was legally settled years ago. Every asset under my name belongs solely to my husband, Cedric Phillips. If he should pass away, my wealth will be donated entirely to the state-no one else will inherit a single cent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had started as a spectacle had now become an official press conference, announcing Daniela&#39;s return to the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The buyer, Caiden, and Joyce found themselves edged out, swallowed by the throng of people</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Powerless, they could do nothing but stand outside and listen as Daniela coolly addressed the reporters</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. There was an explosion three years ago. I was injured and spent the past years recovering. Elite Lux never declared me dead. I&#39;m grateful to my colleagues at Elite Lux for standing by me these past three years. Today, I declare to the world-Daniela Harper is back. Those who plotted against me, hoping to gain from my absence, will soon find themselves nothing more than stepping stones for Elite Lux&#39;s rise.Stay tuned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, for the first time in three years, the stifled team at Elite Lux could finally stand tall again-all thanks to Daniela&#39;s return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The business world braced itself, anticipating the seismic shifts that were about to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the crowd gradually thinned,only Caiden and Joyce remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stared at Daniela, who stood at Elite Lux&#39;s entrance-colder,sharper than she had been three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s voice wavered in disbelief as he gawked at Daniela. &#34;Weren&#39;t you dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression remained icy, her gaze on Caiden as lifeless as if she were staring at a corpse. &#34;You truly wanted me dead.&#34; Her words were not a question-they were a fact. The weight of her words nearly made Caiden collapse, but Joyce quickly steadied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed at the sight. &#34;I never thought my supposed death would reunite the two of you.&#34; The irony wasn&#39;t lost on her-once at odds, now conveniently allies. It was proof of the old saying,&#34;There are no eternal friends, only eternal interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You weren&#39;t dead?&#34; Joyce&#39;s fury flared. The near-sealed deal had just gone up in smoke. How could she not be livid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even if I were dead, my assets wouldn&#39;t be yours to take,&#34; Daniela said coolly to Joyce. &#34;Speaking of disappearances, weren&#39;t you the one who vanished?So why the sudden reappearance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a grand scheme was at play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had &#34;died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce conveniently returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was miraculously pulled out of the asylum</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What other pieces of the puzzle were still hidden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath the illusion of tranquility, a storm brewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get ahead of yourself, Daniela! | told you-l&#39;m still your father, and you owe me support!&#34; Caiden snarled. Without a word, Daniela turned on her heel and strode into Elite Lux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Cedric and Alexander had arrived back from overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasted no time-on her very first day back,she overhauled Elite Lux&#39;s security system,sealing off access to outsiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander found himself blocked at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the employees now holding shares, they saw Elite Lux as their own, and they had nothing but disdain for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While our boss was gone, you acted like a parasite,leeching off our business. And now you dare show your face here? Shameless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander remained unfazed. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t taken over,someone else would have. That&#39;s business. Daniela won&#39;t be sentimental about it. Now, move aside-l need to talk to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carol descended the stairs, Alexander stepped forward and said, &#34;Let Daniela know-l hold considerable power in the country now. If Elite Lux wants to reclaim its former glory, working with me is the quickest route.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol,more fiery than Lillian, scoffed, &#34;You stole from us, and now you&#39;re offering it back like a favor?Alexander, you sure have a twisted sense of business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he was getting nowhere with them,Alexander settled in to wait on the first floor for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited until evening. The moment Daniela stepped out for a walk, Alexander dashed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, let&#39;s talk. I know you&#39;ll change your mind about me. You&#39;ve lost your memory-you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s really on your side. But I am. I&#39;m the only one who won&#39;t hurt you. Trust me,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was certain-Daniela&#39;s memory of him were frozen at the moment of their divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant she must still have feelings for him. If he pushed hard enough, he could win her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I was wrong. I never had feelings for Joyce -not even a little. It&#39;s always been you. Only you.Give me another chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pulled out a folder of legal documents.&#34;Let&#39;s get remarried. Tomorrow. What do you say?&#34;</p>
