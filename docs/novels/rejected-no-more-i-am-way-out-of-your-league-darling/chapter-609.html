                <p>In that instant, a surge of adrenaline rushed through Alexander&#39;s veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commercial was fleeting-mere seconds long-but within that brief window, a familiar silhouette flickered on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he not known that figure so well, it would have slipped past his eyes likea ghost in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the remote tightly, Alexander played that fragment on repeat, obsessively looping it over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after watching it so many times, his emotions remained overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the sting of regret, the bitter taste of knowing all his past efforts had crumbled into nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the bitterness of unrequited love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, that pain was drowned by a surge of exhilaration-he had found her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called over his secretary, pointing at the figure on the TV with intense excitement. &#34;No matter the price, track her downl Who is she? Whera is sha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image had appeared in a blink-there and gone in a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary scrutinized the ad, replaying it over and over, until at last, a flicker-a mere shadow-caught his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,it wasn&#39;t even a shadow. It was something fainter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a hazy reflection on a darkened glass pane distorted by the angle, making the fleeting glimpse even more elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary cast a wary glance at Alexander,questioning if he had unknowingly fallen out of favor Why else would Alexander test him with something so impossible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could dwell on it, Alexander snatched his phone and addressed the vast business network under his influence. &#34;Find out who produced this ad.I want answers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Almost instantly, a reply surfaced. &#34;Mr. Bennett, I can help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response came from none other than the country&#39;s biggest advertising powerhouse, a company that managed top-tier campaigns worldwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander sent a screenshot of the ad and instructed, &#34;Figure out who this reflection belongs to. Also, track down where this commercial was filmed-I need the exact location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he hit send, a rush of anticipation surged through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years-it had been three long, tormenting years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three years, he had been drowning in despair,but now, at last, hope had clawed its way back into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That evening, as he made his way to a banquet, his phone buzzed with a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Bennett, this commercial belongs to Elite Lux.I asked about the reflection in the image, but they only said it would be processed further and refused to share more details. Given Elite Lux&#39;s prestige, we couldn&#39;t push too hard. However, we did uncover one thing-the commercial was filmed in Fiarantian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Alexander secured a flight-he was leaving for Fiarantian that very night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He instructed his driver to be ready at the banquet entrance, ensuring he could make a swift exit the moment it ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that settled, Alexander headed to the banquet,his mood buoyant with anticipation. Amid the chatter and clinking glasses, hushed murmurs rippled through the crowd near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s he doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard he injured his leg in that fire and has only recently been able to get out of bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh! Keep it down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander turned and found himself staring at Cedric -thinner, almost gaunt. Three years had passed since their last encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man standing there was barely a shadow of the man he once knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Cedric carried an air of icy detachment, his presence sharp and unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze gleamed with something dark and dangerous,as if he was teetering on the edge of violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three long years, Cedric had vanished from the corporate battlefield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Cedric&#39;s absence, Alexander had taken off his mask,and because of his resemblance to Cedric, he had gained many advantages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He absorbed the businesses of the eight former key members of the association, along with a significant share of Cedric&#39;s deals. As the president of the association,he held countless advantages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a year, his company had overtaken Cedric&#39;s Phillips Group, rising to the pinnacle of the nation&#39;s business empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,with a fortune in the tens of billions, he was the richest person in the country. No one in the corporate world dared to challenge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing Cedric now, Alexander felt no need to shrink back-those days of humility were over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the eyes of society, between Daniela&#39;s two husbands,Alexander had risen as a commanding figure,a force to be reckoned with. Meanwhile, Cedric had spent three years in the shadows, a ghost of his former self, vanishing from the business world. His name, once spoken with respect, was now uttered only in whispers of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past three years had been a storm of anguish and triumph for Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he had surpassed Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric had always been cold before he married Daniela. Now, he was downright glacial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His aura was sharp, almost lethal-so much so that despite his status as an eligible bachelor, no woman dared venture near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in three years, Cedric stepped back into the public eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first reason was that his injured leg had just healed enough to bear weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second was that the host of the banquet was a former friend of Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came to attend it on behalf of his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was one thing that had haunted Alexander relentlessly for three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had sought Cedric through every possible way-openly, discreetly, and throughcountless intermediaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His only wish was to have his name etched beside Daniela&#39;s on her memorial, yet Cedric refused,unwavering and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even the weight of his title as association president could force Cedric into a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three relentless years, Alexander had refused to surrender. But tonight, for the first time,he wasn&#39;t concerned about it at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, this is odd.&#34; Cedric&#39;s secretary leaned in,voice hushed. &#34;Back when you were in the hospital, Alexander showed up every week. But now that you&#39;re here, he&#39;s suddenly stopped.Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face was sharp, his features hardened by years without a single smile, making him seem even more unapproachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly swirled the wine in his glass, watching the deep red liquid coat the sides. &#34;Look into who Alexander has been speaking with. I want to know exactly what he&#39;s planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded briskly, already pulling up information. As he worked, he added, &#34;Sir, you might not be aware, but some people set up an entirely separate tombstone for the deceased. That way,they can do whatever they want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine glass exploded in Cedric&#39;s grip, shards scattering like deadly embers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crimson trickled down his fingers, merging with the spilled wine in dark, sinuous rivulets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the room as onlookers froze,eyes locked on Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, unbothered, wiped his bloodied hand with a handkerchief, as if the pain was nothing more than a passing inconvenience.</p>
