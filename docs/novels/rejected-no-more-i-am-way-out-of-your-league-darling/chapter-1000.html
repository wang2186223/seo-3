                <p>From the hallway, Hamilton shuffled in with disappointment etched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes caught his, twinkling with a playful spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won,&#34; said Hamilton, his tone giving away his reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A remote sat in Daniela&#39;s palm, while a bowl of pomegranate seeds nestled comfortably on her lap.&#34;You know the rules. You have to live with the result.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton offered a reluctant smile. &#34;Alright. You&#39;ve got me. I&#39;ll keep out of the McCoy family&#39;s business from now on. That&#39;s a promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet nod, Daniela popped a pomegranate seed into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bothered by her calmness, Hamilton asked, his concern showing, &#34;You are not going to kill Brad, are you?He&#39;s still my brother, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shrugged slightly. &#34;It&#39;s possible. I honestly can&#39;t say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty clouded Hamilton&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint grin, Daniela explained, &#34;Cedric volunteered to take care of it. Do you trust him to handle things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton drew a breath, on the verge of objecting, but Daniela simply motioned toward the kitchen. &#34;You&#39;re welcome to share your doubts with him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Hamilton hesitate, his throat suddenly dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rarely had Cedric been one for words, and since Daniela&#39;s pregnancy, he spoke even less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything outside of Daniela rarely caught Cedric&#39;s interest, yet she remained the one boundary he would never allow anyone to cross. If anyone tried to harm Daniela, he wouldn&#39;t hesitate to eliminate them. To be frank, Hamilton admitted he was a bit afraid of his son now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Daniela, thinking negotiating with her was easier. &#34;You&#39;re expecting twins, and all this conflict brings nothing but trouble. Could you ask Cedric to spare Brad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright laughter spilled from Daniela, genuine and unguarded. That sound coaxed a smile from Hamilton as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the kind of laughter that made anyone nearby think she was the happiest person alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking him straight in the eyes, Daniela answered with the same bright smile, &#34;Only blood can repay what was taken from me. You ought to count yourself lucky that this has nothing to do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been someone whose affections and grudges were never muddled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kindness came easily to her, but never to those who had crossed her line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scooping up another pomegranate seed, Daniela remarked, &#34;I&#39;ve lost a baby. It&#39;s something I simply can&#39;t overlook. I refuse to let anyone trample on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheerfulness never faded, though Hamilton felt a cold shiver work its way up his spine. At that moment,he saw why Ethan had chosen to confess in writing. At least Ethan&#39;s life was spared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this hnad reached Brad&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His visits to the kitchen became rare, but he took to wandering through the house with his hands clasped behind him, pausing to point out, &#34;There&#39;s still dust over here. The chairs look crooked over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long while, Daniela let him have his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, it was Phillips Group&#39;s grand opening. Cedric and Daniela headed to the office for the festivities,with Hamilton and Carol joining them for the event.	-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind in the house, Brad let out a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper grew nervous, moving with careful purpose as she cleaned, all the while casting anxious glances at Brad. All afternoon, Brad kept his eyes glued to the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the housekeeper made her way back to.the kitchen, Brad called out, &#34;Lately, the rain&#39;s left my quilt a little damp. Can you put it outside in the yard to air out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitating, the housekeeper looked first at his room, then through the window at the cloudy sky. &#34;The weather&#39;s still looking grim. Would you mind if I dried it tomorrow instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fine. Just make sure you remember,&#34; Brad responded, agreeing without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over the housekeeper as she realized that, with more people due home tomorrow, any surprises could be handled together. Facing the empty house today, she knew a single slip-up could spiral out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Cedric and Daniela weren&#39;t the chatty type, both treated the staff wvith respect and warmth. The salary they offered was unmatched in town, and their main rule was to keep things peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto this job mattered to her, and she hoped it would last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s caution around Brad hadn&#39;t gone unnoticed, so she made sure to stay alert and avoid any possible trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts wandered until a sudden shout from down the hall jolted her to attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped upright, instantly recognizing the cry as coming from Brad&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she hurried to the scene and found Brad clutching his hand, a deep gash pouring blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the white carpet, the stark red stood out in a shocking display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for the phone, she quickly called the doctor, who arrived with impressive speed to tend to Brad&#39;s wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor departed, she returned inside and was struck by how silent the villa had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crept over to the guest room, noticing the door left slightly open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Brad lay still, apparently drifting into sleep after the ordeal. With quiet relief, the housekeeper eased the door closed. She figured by the time he woke, Daniela and Cedric would&#39;ve returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the door quietly shut, she slipped away and turned her attention to tidying the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After nearly two hours had slipped by, the front door opened and Daniela and Cedric returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely stepping inside, Cedric wrinkled his nose and asked, &#34;Why is there such a strong scent of disinfectant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the housekeeper responded, &#34;Mr. Brad McCoy injured himself and there was quite a bit of blood. I cleaned everything to make sure there wasn&#39;t any lingering odor.&#34;</p>
