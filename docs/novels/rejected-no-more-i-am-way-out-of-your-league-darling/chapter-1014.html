                <p>Inside the car,Hamilton finally managed to steady.himself, though the silence between him and Carol felt awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, searching for something to say Carol shot a quick glance at the back of his head-he still refused to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the tension, Carol spoke in an even tone.&#34;You don&#39;t have to act so awkward. Daniela sent me here. I&#39;m just doing what she asked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton straightened his spine, asking, &#34;So Daniela gives an order, and you just go along with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a skeptical look. &#34;Why are you so loyal to her? She tells you to steer clear of Nikolas, and you actually listen. What did she do-save your life or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s gaze stayed locked on the road. &#34;She did. She pulled me out of the orphanage. If not for her, I wouldn&#39;t be here at all. The relationship we share isn&#39;t like the brotherhood you guys brag about. It&#39;s deeper.Maybe that&#39;s why you all end up scheming and betraying each other, while she and I never do. No matter what happens down the road, she&#39;s the only person I&#39;ll ever trust completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blinked, thrown by her blunt loyalty. &#34;What then-when you do get married?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shifted her grip on the wheel, her expression unwavering. &#34;If Daniela doesn&#39;t think a man is good enough, I&#39;m not interested. He&#39;d have to respect her as much as I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton mulled that over, recalling how Nikolas also seemed to take all his cues from Daniela. It was almost like devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So if the guy you end up with can&#39;t get along with Daniela,you&#39;d just write him off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol didn&#39;t hesitate.&#34;Exactly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton fell silent, struggling to accept the implication that every man in the McCoy family had to fall in line behind Daniela. The idea sat uncomfortably with him,prickling his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a casual shrug. &#34;Don&#39;t stress yourself.Nikolas isn&#39;t on my radar anymore, so you can quit scheming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifference stung Hamilton&#39;s ego. &#34;You&#39;re just letting him go? That easy? Nikolas went so far as to starve himself for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol broke into a sharp, unbothered laugh.&#34;Admirers aren&#39;t exactly in short supply for me, and Nikolas isn&#39;t irreplaceable. I know how to make a good life for myself-whether I&#39;m with someone or completely alone. I don&#39;t tie my happiness to any man, and I&#39;m sure as hell not gambling my future on anyone else&#39;s feelings. He starved himself over me, so what? Does that mean I owe him my life? Am I supposed to throw everything away just to reward his devotion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a snort, unapologetic and fiercely self-assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton glanced over, struck by how much Carol echoed Daniela in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol spoke quietly but with unmistakable conviction.&#34;My life isn&#39;t some melodrama. I&#39;m the main character,not a sidekick. If Nikolas can&#39;t even get a handle on his own family, he&#39;s not qualified to stand beside me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Hamilton couldn&#39;t look away from her -he saw Daniela&#39;s determination shining through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He studied the curve of her face, a sudden thought gnawing at him. Maybe he failed as a brother and a father. The brothers he&#39;d treated with genuine loyalty,the sons he&#39;d tried so hard to mentor-why did none of them possess the same steel, the unshakable pride,as the people loyal to Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Hamilton was gone, Jules strolled into Josh&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh sat slouched on the couch, legs bouncing restlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Brad dead or not? And what had happened to Ethan? Where had the body disappeared to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules noticed Josh&#39;s distracted air and spoke up. &#34;Josh,what&#39;s got you so deep in thought?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh jerked upright, snapping out of his trance. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; eyes narrowed. &#34;Who do you think actually killed Brad? Is Daniela going to make it through tonight or not? It&#39;s already past midnight. Why haven&#39;t any of our people reported back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s stomach twisted with unease, a cold sweat prickling his skin as he realized things were slipping beyond his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his fists and hurriedly dialed one of his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line clicked, and a low voice answered,barely above a whisper. &#34;Mr. McCoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh didn&#39;t waste time. &#34;Any updates on Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man hesitated, then replied quietly, &#34;Nothing at all. It&#39;s dead silent over there. Daniela&#39;s in her room-looks like she&#39;s sleeping. No signs of anything out of the ordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s brow furrowed, an uneasy suspicion creeping in.&#34;No cars in or out? Not even a doctor dropping by?Did they find anything? Comb through every detail-l don&#39;t want anything slipping past us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s eyes went wide, nerves edging into their</p>
                
                
                
                <p>voice. &#34;I swear, nothing unusual. The weather&#39;s been awful; nobody&#39;s come or gone. I&#39;ve had a clear view of the living room the whole time. Daniela&#39;s barely moved from the sofa-just watching TV. The only person near her was Cedric, who handed her some fruit. No close contact, no visitors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it. Stay sharp,&#34; Josh said in a low, muffled tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules narrowed his gaze, a note of frustration in his tone. &#34;This doesn&#39;t add up. The person who sold us that poison swore it&#39;d work in four days-max. It&#39;s already day four, and Daniela looks perfectly fine.Did Brad poison her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh rubbed the back of his neck, looking uneasy.&#34;He definitely poisoned her. Maybe we just need to wait it out. Could be that Daniela&#39;s body is tougher than we thought, so the poison&#39;s taking its own damn time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules let out a sharp laugh. &#34;Tough? The seller told us the healthier the target, the faster the poison works.And don&#39;t forget-Daniela&#39;s carrying twins. I don&#39;t care how strong she is-no one could shrug it off this long.If things keep dragging, she&#39;ll give birth before we see any action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to sit still, Jules shot to his feet. &#34;Enough waiting. Why are we just sitting here? We need to check on Daniela-now. I&#39;m telling you, something&#39;s off. What if she caught on and turned the tables on Brad and Ethan? Do you ever think of that? If that&#39;s not the case, why can&#39;t we get through to Ethan after all this time?&#34;Josh stiffened, his expression flickering with guilt.He sure as hell wasn&#39;t about to admit that he had planned the explosion that took Brad&#39;s life. That would make him look far too merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he trailed after Jules, the two of them heading straight for Daniela&#39;s villa.</p>
