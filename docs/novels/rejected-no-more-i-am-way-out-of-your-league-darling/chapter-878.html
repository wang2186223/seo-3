                <p>After Carol tagged Daniela, she watched eagerly.anticipation fluttering as she awaited Daniela&#39;s reply.Yet the chat group fell into an unexpected hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas grinned, teasing Cedric, &#34;Looks like you&#39;re in hot water. Is Daniela mad? She was meant to be at the ceremony, but you said she didn&#39;t need to go. Now.does she suspect you went there on purpose to meet that princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered, &#34;She wouldn&#39;t believe I&#39;d do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he said so, he picked up his stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas observed Cedric-the same man who stood steady before Hamilton-now betraying a flickerof unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, he let out a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was caught up in her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan and Lillian had phoned, reporting trouble at headquarters,though the root cause remained elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While poring over data, she noticed Cedric entering the room. &#34;Back so soon?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric realized she hadn&#39;t seen the chat messages yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela asked casually, &#34;Did it all go well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When silence lingered, she looked up to find Cedric standing just before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put down the data. &#34;So, what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric explained, &#34;The Loglil princess showed up at the ceremony. I bumped into her, but I had no idea she&#39;d be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod. &#34;Alright,got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she lowered her gaze back to the data.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were strange, unpredictable creatures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before coming in, Cedric had feared Daniela might jump to conclusions or overanalyze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, met with her cool indifference, a wave of discomfort settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt like he didn&#39;t matter much to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric muttered, &#34;I&#39;ll go make dinner&#34; Daniela nodded. &#34;Alright. go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, they retreated to their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wrapped up the tasks with Ryan and Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she notice Cedric&#39;s subdued mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked him about it, but Cedric said he was okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was preparing to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric edged nearer and asked, &#34;Don&#39;t you care about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sat cross-legged on the bed&#39;s edge, watching Cedric on the soft cushion, and laughed. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she grasped the situation, Daniela found it amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just some princess from Loglil, right? I&#39;ve seen her photo-she&#39;s nothing special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been confident in her own allure.She had never been outshined in beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Royal connections aside, I&#39;ve earned everything by myself. I believe my own charm outshines any princess leaning on her lineage. She&#39;s no real threat,so I don&#39;t see why I should feel jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela locked eyes with someone,her sincerity  was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met her gaze,catching the unusual brightness in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;But that princess has great taste -she&#39;s noticed you. I saw the messages in the chat group.Damon mentioned Hamilton wanted one of his five sons to marry her, but the princess wasn&#39;t impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned in, planting a gentle kiss on Cedric&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Cedric closed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her kiss trailed from his forehead down to his sharp nose, her soft laughter mingling with the gesture before she finally pressed her lips to his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tender moment cast a romantic glow over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled warmly, teasing. &#34;Looks like my husband is a bit needy.&#34;</p>
