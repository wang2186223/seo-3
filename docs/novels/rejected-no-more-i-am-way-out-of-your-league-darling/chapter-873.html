                <p>Cedric&#39;s face darkened with a stormy scowl</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed composed, calmly dishing out Cedric&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>favorite food as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression twisted into something vicious.&#34;We need to kill Nikolas!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Cedric spoke. Carol&#39;s door slammed open with a bang,fury blazing across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stomped into the room, &#34;Yes! Our backyard&#39;s big enough to plant Nikolas six feet under!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as Carol&#39;s voice faded, the villa door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon stood at the entrance, pale and shaking.&#34;You want to bury Nikolas? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered. &#34;Nikolas found out I&#39;m squeamish about blood, so we&#39;ve got to shut him up. And now you know too. Go ahead, choose a nice spot in the backyard. I&#39;ll grant your final wish personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon looked so terrified he nearly crumpled where he stood. &#34;I was wondering what my dad wanted me to do.Turns out he figured out your weakness!&#34; Damon&#39;s nerves were unraveling. &#34;What do we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed her eyes to slits. &#34;Dead men tell no talesl I&#39;ll wipe you both out, then take out Hamilton!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon began trembling all over again, like a leaf caught in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela casually turned her eyes back to the glowing TV screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric trailed after her. &#34;So, what&#39;s the plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela replied calmly, &#34;It&#39;s okay. Let&#39;s just watch for now. I&#39;ll use the tranquilizer if it comes to that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tranquilizer, of course, had to be administered ahead of time; it needed a while to kick in. Yet strangely, Daniela hadn&#39;t bothered to use it just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nikolas finally came back, everyone was still glued to the TV. It was well past midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The night market was packed, and a hailstorm hit, so I got back late,&#34; he explained. &#34;But I brought food for everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas looked over at Carol, who sat stiffly, eyes forward, radiating defiance like she wouldn&#39;t touch a single bite he brought. Still dripping from the rain, Nikolas went to shower.By the time he came out, Daniela and the others were nibbling on the food he had brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Carol held fast to her proud silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas walked over to Carol. &#34;Not to your taste?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol responded with a cold edge. &#34;I want Alaskan cod.Got any?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused in thought, then stepped outside to make a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela nibbled on the shrimp Cedric had dutifully peeled for her, a realization began to dawn on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, the kitchen looked like a bustling fish market,overflowing with deep-sea catches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper stood frozen in disbelief. &#34;These have to be fresh to taste good! I don&#39;t even know how to cook half of them-and look at the size of these salmon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela peeked over and sure enough, there was a wild assortment of deep-sea fish-more than a dozen kinds,all glistening with sea-brine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas walked in, she raised an eyebrow. &#34;Where did you get these?&#34; Nikolas answered simply. &#34;I called in a favor from an old friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business had been good lately. Daniela eyed the fish mountain and asked,&#34;Did you blow your whole bonus on this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas nodded without hesitation. &#34;Yeah. I kept a bit aside for gas,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smirked knowingly. &#34;Carol was just making an offhand comment. If you pamper her like this, she&#39;ll get impossible to handle. Even your bonus won&#39;t keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face turned earnest. &#34;I&#39;ve got a bid lined up today. If it goes well, I&#39;ll get an early bonus-enough to buy even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. She hadn&#39;t imagined Nikolas had this kind of side to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a slow nod. &#34;Alright then, better hustle.Carol&#39;s got a big appetite and picky taste. Not easy to keep her happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas just shrugged, unfazed, &#34;I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fell silent. Carol stirred awake and emerged from the bedroom. The housekeeper called her to come eat the prepared filleted fish. At first,Carol&#39;s face brightened,but when she learned Nikolas had arranged it, she rolled her eyes in disdain and retreated to the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed sharply in his suit, Nikolas noticed Carol&#39;s hesitation but kept quiet. He made no mention of the effort or cost behind the meal. If she refused, that was her choice. She had whims like anyone else, and to him, that was normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though oblivious to Carol&#39;s true feelings, Nikolas &#39;genuine sincerity struck Daniela as quietly amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol narrowed her eyes, watching Nikolas warily,fearing he might suddenly whip out the hidden blood bag and toss it at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to waste any more time, Daniela seized a chance to visit Nikolas at his workplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came alone-without Cedric or Caol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas offered, &#34;Want me to show you around the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, disinterested, sank into a chair and peeled an orange instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was busy work hours; everyone else was engrossed in their own tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smiled brightly. &#34;The bid went well today. Looks like there&#39;ll be a bonus at month&#39;s end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, then asked, &#34;Any problems along the way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shook his head.&#34;None at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela added softly, &#34;It&#39;s not easy breaking free from the McCoy family. If you need a hand, just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas repeated firmly. &#34;Really, nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By midday. Daniela found herself having lunch at Nikolas&#39; place once more, yet still no sign of any move from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain a yawn, she finally blurted out.&#34;When are you going to use that hidden blood bag? If you don&#39;t act soon, I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
