                <p>Cedric saw through Huey&#39;s ploy in an instant. Huey never actually planned to jump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? Are you going to talk or just hang there? If not, I&#39;ve got better things to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Cedric turned on his heel, making it clear he was done entertaining the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait!&#34; Huey blurted out, his voice cracking with alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was Cedric doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to jump, and Cedric didn&#39;t even flinch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Cedric actually okay with him taking the plunge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But dying was never part of the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric walked away, how was he supposed to keep up the performance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Hackett&#39;s frantic signal, Huey scrambled to recover. &#34;Wait! Hold on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned back, his eyes narrowing, his stare cold and weighted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he thought-pure theatrics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the world watching and the scene unfolding at Elite Lux, there was no way Daniela could escape the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How downright vile!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s throat went dry. The second he locked eyes with Cedric, an icy dread settled in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like Cedric was peeling back every layer of his lie, and the sheer intensity sent a shudder through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric folded his arms, his voice razor-sharp. &#34;Go on. Weren&#39;t you just about to say something?&#34; Huey gulped, his Adam&#39;s apple bobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett clenched his fists, growing impatient. Useless idiot! It was just Cedric, damn it! What was Huey so scared of?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett shot Huey a seething glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey recoiled slightly, then straightened up, forcing his voice louder. &#34;Daniela has left me no choice-I don&#39;t want to live anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a short, incredulous laugh. &#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey floundered, grasping for a response. Wasn&#39;t it obvious? He was standing on the damn edge! If the cameras weren&#39;t rolling, he would&#39;ve cursed Cedric out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric eyed Huey&#39;s reddening face and let out a cold chuckle.11SO1,your grand strategy is to dangle off a building and guilt us into playing nice in business? Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey gaped, words failing him. That was exactly it. But hearing Cedric say it out loud made it sound so pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, Huey had nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out another amused scoff.&#34;Cat got your tongue? Or did I lay it out too plainly? You couldn&#39;t keep up with a woman in business, so now you&#39;re here throwing a tantrum on her doorstep? Damn, Huey, that&#39;s low-even for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s face burned with humiliation. &#34;I don&#39;t want to live anymore! If you have the guts, don&#39;t interfere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t try to change my mind! Daniela is merciless-she crushes her rivals without hesitation. I lost the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>business war, but with my death, the world will see her true, ugly face!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes, his expression unreadable but laced with contempt. &#34;You lost, and that makes you the victim? That&#39;s what you&#39;re telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His usual commanding tone carried a weight that loomed over Huey, making it feel as if he were a mere 00ook bonoath Cadric&#39;e towering precence Huey sensed control slipping through his fingers, the conversation unraveling faster than he could salvage it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric fell silent, arms crossed, his sharp gaze drilling into Huey like a judge awaiting a confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s gaze dropped to the dizzying height below, his stomach twisting as terror coiled inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fall from this hundred-story tower meant certain death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flickered in Huey&#39;s eyes. Where was the safety net Hackett had assured him of? His gaze darted to Hackett, seeking an answer. Where was the rescue team? Where was the damn net?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric caught the hesitation in Huey&#39;s stance, the flicker of doubt in his eyes. &#34;Huey, are you coming down or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey clenched his teeth, jaw tightening as if that alone could hold his resolve together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was ice-cold. &#34;Step down now, and you might still save face. But wait until the crowd disperses and slink down in shame? That would be truly humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s face lost all color, a sickly pallor settling over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, his feet inched back, away from the ledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huey!&#34; Hackett&#39;s voice suddenly sliced through the air, sharp and urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Huey whipped around, his balance teetering on the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the crowd, the tension thick enough to choke on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s brows knitted together. Without hesitation, he shot his hand out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey was a scoundrel, no doubt, but Cedric wasn&#39;t about to let him die on Elite Lux&#39;s turf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric!&#34; Huey dangled helplessly, feet searching for something solid. His eyes brimmed with tears, panic raw in his voice, &#34;Don&#39;t let go! I don&#39;t want to die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric bent forward, his grip tightening around Huey&#39;s hand like a vice. Hackett hurried to Cedric&#39;s side, his gaze cool and impassive as he observed the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey lifted his head, locking eyes with Hackett&#39;s detached, unreadable stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Comeon!&#34; Hackett dropped into a crouch, stretching out his armn. &#34;Huey, take my hand! Hold on tight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey&#39;s instincts took over; his hand shot forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure he had grasped Hackett&#39;s hand. But then, Hackett shook off his hand, as if Hackett wanted him dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of shock ran through Huey, leaving him frozen, his mind struggling to process what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His moment of hesitation cost him-his fingers slid dangerously from Cedric&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s frown deepened. Without wasting a second, he lunged forward with both hands. &#34;Hold on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next heartbeat, a rush of hands grabbed Cedric, anchoring him, as together they hauled Huey up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey collapsed onto solid ground, his legs useless beneath him, his whole body trembling like a leaf in a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Hackett, mouth agape, disbelief etched into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hackett, still reeling from the moment, pulled Huey into a tight embrace. &#34;Huey, what the hell happened?Why didn&#39;t you hold on? You scared me half to death! If you&#39;d fallen, how could I ever face your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face carried a perfect mask of concern, not a single crack in the performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey,still dazed, stared blankly, questioning if the last few moments had even been real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire spectacle had spiraled into a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they escorted him away, Huey cast one last glance at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opposite Cedric, Daniela stood, her voice low, her expression one of quiet concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huey dropped his qaze, shoulders heavy with exhaustion, and silently followed the others.</p>
