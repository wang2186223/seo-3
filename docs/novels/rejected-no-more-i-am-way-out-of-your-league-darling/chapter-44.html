                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t keep her frustration in check any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gala was almost over, and Alexander still hadn&#39;t made a move to talk to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she didn&#39;t care much for Daniela, she was very interested in the building Daniela owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat next to Alexander, her voice filled with jealousy. &#34;Alexander, look at Daniela acting so superior, just because she has money. She&#39;s strutting around like she&#39;s the queen of the world with all those men around her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce meant to mock Daniela, but her words sounded incredibly bitter instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Keith, who was nearby, couldn&#39;t hold back a laugh. &#34;If you had the talent, you could act just as confident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pouted, her face flushed with anger, but the truth of his words left her momentarily speechless.Swallowing her irritation, she silently directed all the blame at Daniela for the embarrassment she felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Keith, she turned to Alexander and pleaded,&#34;When are you going to talk to Daniela? My boutique&#39;s been shut down for weeks now. The stock&#39;s going bad in storage! I&#39;m losing a fortune.I need that prime spot to open up again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith stared at Joyce in disbelief. &#34;Are you serious?You&#39;ve got the audacity to ask her for that? Forget everything else for a moment-didn&#39;t you already ruin Daniela andAlexander&#39;s wedding? And now, you&#39;re asking her for a shop space? I never realized you could be this shameless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face turned bright red with fury. She put her hands on her hips and shot back, &#34;What&#39;s it to you?Get out of here!&#34; Her voice was cutting, and she glared at Keith like she could tear him apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith rolled his eyes and stood up, shaking his head in disbelief. Before walking away, he leaned down close to Alexander and muttered, &#34;Alexander,your taste in women is awful. You gave up Daniela for this?You&#39;ve really made a huge mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and walked off, leaving Alexander sitting there, his expression dark and full of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander,&#34; Joyce said, her voice softening as she put on a pleading look. &#34;I know Daniela can&#39;t stand me, but I really need this space. Can you talk to her?She always listens to you. If you ask, she&#39;ll definitely say yes.Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes drifted to Daniela, standing off to the side, surrounded by admirers. After a long moment of hesitation, he said coldly, &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the gala was wrapping up and Daniela was about to leave, a voice suddenly called out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to see Alexander and Joyce approaching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wore a serious look, while Joyce walked with her head held high. To anyone watching, it would almost look like Daniela owed them everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Alexander led Joyce forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed calm, saying nothing as she locked her eyes on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, the cold indifference in her expression sparked an immediate irritation in Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Daniela had followed him around, hanging on every word, always eager to please. But now, the roles had reversed, and she couldn&#39;t even be bothered to mask her impatience with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, unable to stay quiet any longer, spoke up.&#34;Daniela, Alexander wants to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood tall with an air of grace. Even with her aloof exp ression, her beauty was impossible to ignore. She raised her hand, signaling him. &#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face grew even more tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the new Daniela-distant and unreachable.Her attitude was beginning to wear on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she was going to act like this, he wasn&#39;t about to make things easier for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He definitely wasn&#39;t going to put himself out to help her with the city redevelopment project his father had spoken about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No construction company in Olisvine could rival the Bennett family&#39;s level of expertise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without their involvement, the land Daniela had recently acquired would remain unused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These thoughts only added to his irritation, and his voice became more pointed. &#34;I need to talk to you.You choose the location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela almost burst out laughing at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really how he approached someone for a conversation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sayinga thing, she turned and walked away,leaving Alexander and Joyce standing there,completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...&#34; Joyce couldn&#39;t hold back her frustration as Daniela&#39;s car pulled away, the exhaust fumes sweeping over them. Turning to Alexander, she demanded, &#34;Alexander, did I just see that right? Did 1hear you correctly? You literally told Daniela you wanted to talk, and that&#39;s how she responded? She just walked away without even looking back. How could she be so rude?&#34;</p>
