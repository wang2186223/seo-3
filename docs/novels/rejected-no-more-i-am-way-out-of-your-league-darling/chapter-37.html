                <p>Cedric braced against the biting wind, his eyes narrowing as each gust whipped across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He observed Daniela gracefully advancing towards Luxor Tower,her long gown billowing at her side. The fierce wind sculpted her figure into an image of fragile elegance,isolated against the urban backdrop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, a sharp pang of discomfort seized Cedric&#39;s heart-an acute, undeniable twinge that demanded his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling his phone from his pocket, he hastily dialed a number. &#34;Ryan, it&#39;s Cedric. I need you down here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan, who had been entrenched in his efforts to overhaul the building&#39;s security system, had been deprived of sleep for several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in his worn hoodie, he trudged downstairs,his appearance haggard under the faint lighting, his lips pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up, Cedric?&#34; Ryan queried,his voice weary and raspy. Cedric&#39;s eyes remained fixed on the 25th floor,illuminated by the light in Daniela&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Cedric&#39;s concerned look, Ryan retrieved a lollipop from his pocket, unwrapping it and placing it in his mouth. &#34;Didn&#39;t you just see her off to her room?What&#39;s the worry now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;She&#39;s not happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan swiveled towards him, his expression etched with confusion.&#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Ryan, understanding human emotions was a puzzle with no clear solution, endlessly complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing his lips tightly, Cedric made a request. &#34;I have a housekeeper to look after Daniela. Help me with the arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan opened his mouth to respond, but Cedric quickly added,&#34;She&#39;s refused me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed on Ryan&#39;s brow. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric replied, &#34;She told me Lillian would handle it.I need you to hack into Lillian&#39;s computer and ensure the right person is chosen. I&#39;ll take care of everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric envisioned a future encounter with the Harper family, where the housekeeper would not merely stand there, tear-stricken and defenseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought stirred a wave of discomfort within him. He knew he wouldn&#39;t findpeace until the matter was settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a confident nod, Ryan replied, &#34;Understood.Don&#39;t worry, Cedric. I&#39;ll handle it to perfection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few more remarks, Ryan made his way back upstairs. Meanwhile, Cedric leaned back to gaze once more at the 25th floor, catching the moment Daniela&#39;s lights dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela felt no urgency to employ a housekeeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the decade dedicated to winning Alexander&#39;s heart,she had honed her self-reliance to an art form.Her domestic prowess was unmatched, maintaining her home in impeccable order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, ever particular about his meals, had prompted Daniela to seek culinary skills from various esteemed chefs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Alexander found her cooking beyond reproach.Although he was sparing with his praises, he would occasionally let slip a rare word of appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consequently, Daniela saw no immediate need to recruit additional help. She had delegated the task to Lillian but stressed that there was no need to hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Joyce&#39;s disruptive antics weren&#39;t going to cease any time soon. Hiring someone too soft-spoken or gentle might only lead them to be overwhelmed by bullying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Daniela hadn&#39;t anticipated the rapid pace at which events would unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, as the sunlight peeked through her curtains, Daniela&#39;s first sight was Lillian, standing beside her bed with a wide, infectious smile. &#34;l&#39;ve found you a housekeeper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes flickered open, a fog of sleep clouding her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t even been...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a quick glance at the clock on her bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even ten hours had passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smirk, Lillian added, &#34;I hopped online early this morning to scout for a housekeeper, and guess what?The perfect candidate was just there, waiting to be found. She&#39;s exceptional-skilled in all aspects of housework. She can whip up specialty dishes from across the globe. And that&#39;s not all-she&#39;s fluent in five languages and has a knack for childcare. Should you decide to have children one day, she&#39;s fully equipped to manage it all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t help but be impressed; the woman sounded almost too good to be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beaming with enthusiasm, Lillian added, &#34;I&#39;ve already invited her over for a trial run-she&#39;s actually waiting for us downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mix of curiosity and intrigue, Daniela followed Lillian down the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Ms. Harper. My name is Josie Maynard,but please,call me Josie. I&#39;m here to look after all your household needs. Should you have any specific requests, feel free to let me know,&#34; Josie Maynard stated with a warm, welcoming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gazed at Josie-a middle-aged woman,slightly rounded with a welcoming, kind air that made her seem instantly familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have we met before?&#34; Daniela asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie, her hands clasped before her, maintained her gentle smile. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious! I simply possess an ordinary face. What are the chances someone like me would ever cross paths with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words left her lips, Josie&#39;s eyes flickered towards Daniela, her smile deepening with a subtle but undeniable reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, Daniela was a sight to behold. A vision, almost ethereal, that could easily captivate anyone&#39;s attention, including Cedric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Harper, I&#39;ve prepared some sandwiches for you this morning and squeezed some fresh juice. I had to make do since my arrival was rather rushed, but I plan to shop later. Please, tell me your preferences for tomorrow&#39;s meals, and I&#39;ll ensure everythingis to your liking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t usually one for breakfast, her appetite seldom stirring in the early hours, but Josie&#39;s culinary skills were irresistible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sandwiches looked delicious, and the juice was fresh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela had finished her breakfast, Josie placed a shawl around her shoulders. &#34;The mornings carry a bit of a chill. Don&#39;t forget to look after yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her characteristic smile beaming, Josie then seized a compact shopping cart and set off to purchase groceries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Lillian observed her departure, her  expression radiant with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie was a remarkably considerate soul, seemingly crafted perfectly to complement Daniela&#39;s needs.</p>
