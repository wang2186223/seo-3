                <p>Nikolas kept glancing Carol&#39;s way, subtly gesturing in hopes she&#39;d step in on his behalf. But she acted as though he didn&#39;t exist. Left without support, he shifted his focus to Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got it covered,&#34; Cedric stated firmly. &#34;From now on, I&#39;ll grow every vegetable myself. Everything else will be flown in. I&#39;m cutting out every possible threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stared at him like he&#39;d gone completely insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Carol escorted the guests out, Nikolas asked,&#34;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s going overboard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol folded her arms, her expression unreadable.&#34;It&#39;s necessary. Cedric lost a child in that blast, and Daniela nearly died. Of course he wants to control every detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas studied the calm set of her face, then muttered, &#34;You should watch out for yourself, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol simply gave a brief nod and strode away,leaving him standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas lingered in place, unmoving, until Damon ambled over and clapped a hand on his shoulder.&#34;Give it up. Carol&#39;s never been one to hesitate. Once she makes up her mind, she just walks away. You tried giving her a look, but she didn&#39;t even glance your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s gaze followed Carol&#39;s retreating figure.&#34;She&#39;s always known her own mind. When she reached out and you ignored her, she didn&#39;t cause a scene-just turned on her heel and left. That&#39;s Carol.No drama,no teas. She&#39;s nothing if not direct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nudged Nikolas toward the car. &#34;Let&#39;s go. Dad&#39;s only thinking about his future grandson now-he couldn&#39;t care less about the rest of us, And honestly,Nikolas, it&#39;s better to end things with Carol now. The two of you were never going to work, not with Dad breathing down your neck. You know he&#39;d never accept you marrying someone wvithout any family connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a troubled scowl, Nikolas climbed into the car and followed the others home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Daniela doesn&#39;t want the help?&#34; Hamilton sat on the sofa, mulling over names for his potential grandson when he noticed the returning servants. He shot upright, bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon took a long drink of water before answering,&#34;That&#39;s not it. Daniela&#39;s upstairs. Cedric isn&#39;t letting anyone get close to her-especially not anyone from the McCoy family. He&#39;s sent us all packing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened, his disappointmnent sharp. &#34;Why are you all back here? Your sister-in-law&#39;s pregnant and instead of looking after her,you come running home? Fucking useless, every last one of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped his car keys, ready to leave, when Nikolas called out, &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton shot him a stern look. &#34;What now?&#34; Nikolas didn&#39;t flinch as he remarked, &#34;Cedric can take good care of Daniela, but there are people lying in wait, watching for any sign of weakness. He&#39;s not prepared for snakes in the grass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words struck Hamilton, his eyes sharpening with sudden clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pressed on, each word carefully measured.&#34;Daniela&#39;s pregnancy paints a target on her back.The next three months will be dangerous, but once they know the baby&#39;s a boy? Every threat will multiply.Your siblings won&#39;t just sit back and watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep furrow formed on Hamilton&#39;s brow as the warning sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas met Hamilton&#39;s gaze, his tone even, almost cold. &#34;If you want to protect the baby, you need to keep an eye on your siblings because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trailed off, letting the implication hang heavy betwveen them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression darkened, a grave understanding settling in as he looked at Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; tone was ice-cold as he went on, &#34;Because they don&#39;t want Daniela to have a baby boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s complexion drained of all color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela has already lost a child,&#34; Nikolas continued,his gaze unwavering. &#34;We both know Grandpa wouldn&#39;t let you look into it, which only meant the murderer was one of the McCoy family. Do you really want to risk losing this one too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton blurted out, &#34;Absolutely not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he stormed out and barked orders to Scarface, who stood rigidly by the door,&#34;Put,out a bounty on the underground network.I want the top hundred special forces operatives-hire them all. Their job is to guard my future grandson,no matter what. And get another hundred mercenaries to keep eyes on every single McCoy family member,twenty-four séven. If anyone makes a move...&#34; He paused, the silence growing heavy. Finally, his voice dropped to a lethal murmur. &#34;Don&#39;t bother reporting to me. Just take them down,right then and there.&#34;</p>
