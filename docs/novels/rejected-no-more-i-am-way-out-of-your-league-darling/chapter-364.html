                <p>Lillian escorted Katrina to Elite Lux&#39;s exclusive wardrobe to pick out an outfit. Amidst the splendid array of garments, Katrina selected a particularly luxurious gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she wore the dress, she felt unstoppable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the top floor of Elite Lux, Katrina gazed down at the city below, overwhelmed by a sense of supremacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina savored this feeling, vowing silently to always live in luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 6 P.M., Katrina was riding in Daniela&#39;s car, gliding smoothly along the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina occupied the front seat, while Katrina and Daniela were in the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her head, Katrina looked at Daniela, whose poise and confidence were palpable against the backdrop of shifting city lights, mnaking her seem in complete control of her fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you helping me?&#34; Katrina asked in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela,previously resting with her eyes shut, opened them slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car&#39;s confined space, her low chuckle resonated, reigniting Katrina&#39;s unease. &#34;Why are you laughing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained silent, and shortly after, the car arrived at the event venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina quickly spotted someone she knew and walked over to engage them in conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, still waiting for Cedric to arrive, struck up a casual conversation with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you bother helping Katrina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sipping her drink, Daniela answered,&#34;She&#39;s still my stepmother, despite everything. I can&#39;t let her face utter humiliation. We are family, after all. Whatever her past actions, I expect her to come around to my side eventually.&#34; As she spoke, Daniela&#39;s gaze shifted back to Nina, who appeared contemplative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mimicked innocence, Daniela continued, &#34;In her old age, when she can no longer walk, who else wil she depend on but me? Katrina is no fool; she understands the stakes. It&#39;s just that she&#39;s not ready to shift her loyalty yet. I&#39;m patient. I know she&#39;ll confess whatever I need to hear within a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s frown deepened at Daniela&#39;s confidence. &#34;You&#39;re certain of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a serene smile, her face illuminated softly by the ambient lighting, giving her an almost otherworldly appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina couldn&#39;t help but admire Daniela&#39;s composed demeanor, even as she felt a pang of jealousy for her seemingly effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distracted by her thoughts, Nina barely caught Daniela&#39;s next words. &#34;Katrina has been my stepmother for years. I understand her well. It&#39;s no more chalenging than negotiating in the boardroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making this comparison, Daniela fixed her gaze on Nina, who looked visibly unsettled and excused herself to make a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued to engage politely with the guests, accepting a glass of wine with a reserved smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the garden, Nina was on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Daniela say this herself?&#34; asked the person on the other end of the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina relayed the conversation. &#34;Daniela seems convinced Katrina will confess soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response from the other end of the phone was a prolonged silence, followed by a chilly declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood. If that&#39;s the case, we no longer need to wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina replied, &#34;Yes. Just make sure it&#39;s handled cleanly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hanging up, Nina spotted Cedric making his way into the hall dressed in a sharp black suit. She straightened her dress and confidently approached the gathering. Daniela, observing Nina&#39;s reentry, allowed a slight curl of disdain to touch her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katrina finished mingling, she found her place at the dinner table, comforted slightly by seeing Joyce&#39;s name next to hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,what she saw next caught her off guard.</p>
