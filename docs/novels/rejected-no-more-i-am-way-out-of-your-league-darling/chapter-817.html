                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;If you want Daniela to be kind to you,then you&#39;ll have to treat Cedric right. She let you stay only because of Cedric. What else did you expect?You thought it was your looks or the fact that you&#39;re a McCoy? Does Daniela need to curry favor with you?She doesn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol let out a quiet chuckle as she strolled toward the car. She glanced at Nikolas. &#34;If you don&#39;t believe me, test it yourself. Be good to Cedric, and you&#39;ll see -she&#39;ll treat you like family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas retorted, &#34;She doesn&#39;t seem to give a damn about this whole &#39;family&#39; thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded. &#34;That&#39;s true, but it doesn&#39;t stop her from wanting Cedric to receive the familial love and care she never got herself. Otherwise, when you asked for a milk bath yesterday, she&#39;d have kicked you out already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas slid into Carol&#39;s car, his mind still tangled in confusion. &#34;Why is Daniela so good to Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m not sure. What I do know is Daniela truly cares about him. Since we care about her, we&#39;re kind to Cedric just to see her smile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt lingered in Nikolas&#39; eyes, clouding his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more he thought about it, the more a storm of jealousy and frustration churned in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why? Why did he have to be nice to Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Daniela only light up when Cedric was treated nicely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet somewhere deep in his chest, envy curled its fingers around his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could trade places with Cedric-the man Daniela cared about so deeply, the one she cherished so much-that would be great.  Nikolas followed Carol to the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked in, heads turned in surprise toward Nikolas-disowned by his own family and now appearing to take shelter under Daniela&#39;s wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas trailed behind Carol as they went upstairs and stepped into Daniela&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol passed the candies from her hand to Daniela,then offered some to Cedric with a smile. &#34;These are from Nikolas. He said they&#39;re really good-special treats from Oiscoll. He bought them especially for you to try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol stressed the word &#34;especially,&#34; her voice calm but pointed, then locked eyes with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric popped one into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol asked, &#34;How&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wasn&#39;t big on sweets, but this candy wasn&#39;t too sweet. A light floral scent filled his mouth, and the taste was quite nice. Cedric gave a small nod. &#34;Not bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas smirked proudly. &#34;These are the finest candies from Oiscoll-a treat fit for royalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wanted to say that Cedric ought to feel lucky to try these candies, but seeing Daniela silently hold a candy and watch him with a blank look, he recalled Carol&#39;s warning. He told Cedric, &#34;If you like them, I&#39;ll bring more next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished, Nikolas caught a quick flash of surprise on Cedric&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Don&#39;t like it?&#34; Nikolas asked, his voice still dripping with arrogance-a habit he hadn&#39;t yet shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shook his head and popped another candy in.&#34;No, it&#39;s just... You&#39;re really strange today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; ears flushed red at the remark. He coughed,trying to mask his embarrassment. &#34;What&#39;s strange about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of his eye, he glanced at Daniela. She unwrapped the candy she held, popped it into her mouth, then lowered her head, focusing on the data spread out on her desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t spoken once during the whole exchange,but Nikolas felt her silent approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t interrupt his talk with Cedric, nor did she stop him from giving the candies. She didn&#39;t even seem suspicious of the treats he brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Nikolas understood Carol was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Cedric wasn&#39;t hurt, Daniela usually stayed hands-off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought left Nikolas feeling both jealous and bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How deeply did Daniela love Cedric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How far would she go to spoil him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was still brooding when the company&#39;s scheduled partners showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unusual for Alexander to be so low-key. He came in last, trailing behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s secretary walked up to her. &#34;Ms. Harper,these are the partners for the collaboration. They&#39;re here to go over the details of the cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had acquired this company, with the contract sealed and signed before the takeover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was sure Daniela wouldn&#39;t renege on the deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton was right-Daniela wouldn&#39;t break the agreement. As long as Alexander stayed professional, she had no reason to mix personal feelings with business. Business was business, and emotions stayed separate. She understood that line well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander, on his part, kept a professional attitude during the entire meeting. He stayed well within his limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the conference room, Daniela held court at the head of the table, absorbing the team&#39;s ideas for their latest collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alexander&#39;s turn came, he straightened his tailored suit and strode confidently to the podium,silently seeking Daniela&#39;s nod of approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words flowed smoothly, his confidence radiating with every sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, by the door, Nikolas scoffed under his breath.&#34;What a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol raised an eyebrow at Nikolas. &#34;Why hold such a grudge against Alexander? What has he ever done to you?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t admit that when he said he wanted Daniela&#39;s attention, his father said Alexander was a better fit than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing his pride, he muttered, &#34;I just find people like him-fake and full of themselves-really annoying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol laughed softly. &#34;Well, you&#39;re nowhere near Cedric in that department.&#34; Nikolas&#39; temper flared immediately. &#34;What do you mean? How exactly am I worse than Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol answered calmly, &#34;At least Cedric wouldn&#39;t waste time getting mad over someone like Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knows Daniela doesn&#39;t care about people like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s not worth being a rival-or being taken seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas froze, then glanced over at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down the long hallway, the CEO&#39;s office door was cracked open just enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric sat with his head bowed, absorbed in the papers he held.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly as Carol said, Cedric seemed utterly unfazed by Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas couldn&#39;t grasp it. &#34;Doesn&#39;t Cedric care about Daniela? Alexander is her ex-husband, right? That&#39;s no small thing.Doesn&#39;t Cedric feel any discomfort at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol laughed, shaking her head. &#34;Confidence springs from one&#39;s strength. Nikolas, you&#39;ve spent too long under Hamilton&#39;s shadow. You might seem like you&#39;re on top, but you don&#39;t know what it means to earn your place on your own. Honestly, I pity you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she shook her head and walked off,leaving Nikolas frozen in place far longer than he expected.</p>
