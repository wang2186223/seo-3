                <p>Daniela stayed up until after one in the morning working on the puzzle, then finally headed to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always found sleep elusive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The puzzle Cedric gave her had helped burn off some energy, letting her fall asleep somewhat earlier than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rose around six.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a morning run with Cedric, she returned to find Katrina waiting for them, beaming. &#34;Daniela, your father is facing severe financial difficulties. Is it possible to extend the repayment term?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drying off with a towel, Daniela asked, &#34;Do you intend to repay the debt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina nodded earnestly.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, they intended to return the money Joining Elite Lux would bolster Harper Group considerably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out now would be tantamount to throwing away a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina took this as a sign of Daniela&#39;s agreement to delay the payment, but Daniela&#39;s next words took her aback. &#34;Plan your payments from prison then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s smile stiffened, and she was speechless for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was venting his frustration again. Cedric gave him a chilling look, causing Caiden&#39;s complaints to diminish to a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was overwhelming for Caiden! Daniela&#39;s return had irritated him, and bringing the influential Cedric made him too intimidated to speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his grievances, Caiden managed to gather the necessary funds. This effort drained their savings completely. They had investments abroad, yet the losses were significant. Caiden had to sell eight private properties to barely manage the shortfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After resolving the finances, Caiden was utterly exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His bank account dwindled to just ten thousand dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Caiden felt the sting of poverty he had known before his marriage to Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked for Alaskan sablefish. What is this? Have you tried to deceive me with fake seafood?&#34; Joyce complained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the kitchen, the servant responded meekly,head bowed, &#34;Miss Harper, your father has reduced the food budget. We can no longer afford luxury items.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce voiced her displeasure immediately. Turning to Katrina, she exclaimed, &#34;Mom, you promised that marrying into the Harper family would ensure a good life. What&#39;s going on? I demand Alaskan sablefish,not this garbage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, clenching her teeth, soothed her gently.&#34;Sweetheart, just a bit longer. Once Daniela stabilizes the company and it begins to yield profits,our situation will improve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina and Caiden had researched and discovered that even the least profitable of the companies Daniela managed was generating over ten billion a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Harper Group&#39;s unstable foundations,earning five billion annually was more than sufficient for a lavish lifestyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This rationale led Caiden to comply and hand over the money without further fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sulked. &#34;We only see dividends at year&#39;s end!That&#39;s months away! How do you expect me to endure until then? Did you know the caviar Tasha prepared yesterday had dirt in it? How can I possibly  eat that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina shared her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling her past in the countryside, she had faced numerous challenges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, over the years, she had grown accustomed to comfort and found hardships unbearable now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quietly, Katrina advised Joyce, &#34;Ask your father to request an advance from the finance department later. Also, have him ask Daniela to switch to monthly dividend distributions. That way, he can secure ten million for you immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce muttered, &#34;Alright, but Dad needs to speak with Daniela soon. I&#39;mn tired of this lifestyle! It would be embarrassing if people learned I was served dirty caviar!&#34;</p>
