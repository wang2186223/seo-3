                <p>Daniela arched a brow at Hamilton, as if he&#39;d finally.lost his grip on reality. &#34;If I really wanted Brad dead, do you think I&#39;d go about it in such an idiotic way? Please.If I had meant to kill him, he&#39;d never have made it this far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton hesitated, then gave a reluctant nod. &#34;Fair.But if it wvasn&#39;t you, then who in their right mind would try to lay a hand on anyone from the McCoy family in Oiscoll?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you think?&#34; Daniela&#39;s tone was light,almost mocking. &#34;You should open your mind a little more. Ever consider the threat might be coming from inside the McCoy family itself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That idea clearly rattled Hamilton. His eyes narrowed as he mulled it over, the gears in his head turning behind a mask of suspicion. Without another word,he spun on his heel and strode out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep a close eye on things, Carol,&#34; Daniela instructed curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, arms folded and chin tipped up in defiance,let out a disgruntled huff. &#34;It wouldn&#39;t hurt for that old guy to learn a lesson or two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced over, studying her for a long beat.Finally, she shrugged. &#34;If it doesn&#39;t bother you that he&#39;s Nikolas&#39; father, it certainly doesn&#39;t bother me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s lips twitched as she muttered reluctantly,&#34;Isn&#39;t he Cedric&#39;s father too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze slid to Cedric&#39;s impassive face before she spoke, her tone light. &#34;Clearly, my husband doesn&#39;t seem to mind. But Nikolas certainly does. Do as you please. It&#39;s not a command.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From outside, the deep rumble of a car engine rolled into the quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sipped her coffee, resuming her breakfast without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot to her feet, her chair scraping back in frustration. &#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a soft laugh that turned into a small cough, forcing Cedric to reach over and pat her back with an amused grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wvas already barreling down the road,heading straight for Josh&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Josh sat watching the news as his brows knitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anchor reported that only Brad had been found in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He narrowed his eyes, suspicion hardening in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No remains? How come no traces were left behind? And wasn&#39;t Ethan supposed to be stuffed into Brad&#39;s suitcase? So where the hell was he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh barely had time to make sense of the situation before Hamilton stormed in, his face dark with rage &#34;Did you kill Brad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot him a glare, annoyance flaring instantly. His temper was legendary, a fuse short as a summer spark.&#34;What the hell are you talking about? You got proof?Or are you just here to pick a fight? Actually,I was about to ask you if Daniela killed Brad. Otherwise,how did he end up dead out of nowhere? Hamilton, I&#39;m not letting you leave until I get some real answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton froze, clearly rattled by Josh&#39;s vehemence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s tone turned cold and biting. &#34;And ever since this went down, I&#39;ve been calling Ethan non-stop.Why can&#39;t I get through to him? What did Daniela pull this time? Out with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton stared at him, unable to get a single word past his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh swung his arm and shoved Hamilton hard enough to send him stumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton teetered backward, the sharp edge of the table looming toward his skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the front door slammed open, and a pair of arms caught Hamilton just in time.Hamilton squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for pain that never came. Instead, he felt himself hauled upright,steady hands gripping his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blinking, he spun around-Carol stood behind him,arms folded and gaze steely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Hamilton muttered,still shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol arched an eyebrow, shooting Josh a look of pure contempt. &#34;Planned to kill him,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh curled his lip, his glare dripping with malice,furious that his blow hadn&#39;t landed. Today was supposed to be Daniela&#39;s downfall, and he was ready to take Hamilton down with her. Carol&#39;s sudden appearance had wrecked everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh McCoy!&#34; Hamilton barked, still reeling from the close call. The brute force behind Josh&#39;s attack left no doubt-he planned to seriously injure him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton twisted around, heart pounding as the razor -sharp table edge threatened to split his skull. Had he collided with it, the outcome would have been catastrophic. He shot Josh a glare, voice trembling with outrage. &#34;How could you stoop so low as to attack me? You killed Brad, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms folded tightly, Josh snorted with icy disdain.&#34;You&#39;re accusing me of murder? Where&#39;s your proof?If you don&#39;t have any, then save your breath and get lost.&#34;Hamilton seethed in place, fists clenched, struggling to keep his temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot him a look of disdain. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s go.You&#39;re no match for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the time spent with Daniela had never left Carol feeling so thoroughly defeated. Now, it was unmistakable to her-Hamilton&#39;s bravado was a flimsy mask he only wore around his children. In front of his brothers, he was completely stripped of power, a man rendered helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol strode out, her jaw set, while Hamilton trailed after her, burning with humiliation and rage</p>
