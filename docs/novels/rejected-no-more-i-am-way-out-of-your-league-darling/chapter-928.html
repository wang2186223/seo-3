                <p>Josh never imagined Hamilton would go so far as to mock him right to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His anger boiling over, he jabbed a finger at Hamilton. &#34;I&#39;m still your older brother, no matter what. What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you actually hoping I never have a grandson? You better get your facts straight. Daniela only went to buy a pregnancy test. There&#39;s no proof she&#39;s expecting.You&#39;re jumping the gun!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad interjected, &#34;Seriously, Hamilton, maybe take it down a notch. What if Daniela isn&#39;t pregnant? You might be the one feeling sorry in the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he said it, Brad shot a pointed look at Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules added fuel to the fire with a sarcastic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From what I heard, Daniela&#39;s been fragile since her last miscarriage. I doubt she&#39;d get pregnant again so quickly. You might just be setting yourself up for disappointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s secretary stood by, visibly struggling to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to say something in Daniela&#39;s defense,but a sharp look from Josh made him bite his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton started to worry he&#39;d gone too far. lf Daniela wasn&#39;t actually pregnant, everyone would turn on him for celebrating too soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but think he&#39;d rejected the princess a little hastily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the test came back negative, he would have lost more than just his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought led Hamilton to consider texting the princess, hoping there was still a chance to patch things up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s health had always been Cedric&#39;s top priority. Even a small patch of sunlight would have Cedric rushing over with an umbrella. Was it really possible for her to get pregnant so easily? It seemed unlikely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s early excitement faded fast, leaving him with nothing but regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the McCoy family watched Hamilton with mocking smiles. &#34;Let&#39;s all go see if Daniela is pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices rang out, bold and unrestrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a low voice, the secretary tried to reassure Hamilton. &#34;It&#39;s a fifty-fifty chance that she&#39;s pregnant. Don&#39;t losehope, Mr.McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton answered with clear irritation, &#34;Half the chance means she might not be pregnant at all, and even if she is, there&#39;s still the possibility it&#39;s a girl. So many outcomes could make me look foolish. The more I celebrate now, the bigger the joke will be on me later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh overheard Hamilton&#39;s complaints and said with  a mocking grin, &#34;So you know you&#39;ll get laughed at. I thought you were so worked up because you were positive Daniela was having a boy. Turns out you&#39;re just guessing like the rest of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family burst out laughing, their eyes nearly closing with amusement as they shook with laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary couldn&#39;t hold back any longer.&#34;There&#39;s always a chance, isn&#39;t there? Daniela&#39;s got that regal look about her. If she&#39;s expecting, it&#39;s sure to be a boy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp smack rang out as the secretary was slapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brows knit together, ready to defend his secretary, but Josh cut him off. &#34;What&#39;s the problem? I&#39;m your older brother. If you can&#39;t keep your own people in line, then I&#39;ll do it for you.If our father were here, he&#39;d be on my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp edge in his voice, Hamilton said, &#34;I&#39;ll handle my own team when it comes to discipline.&#34;  Josh responded, &#34;Oh, will you? I have my doubts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he brushed past Hamilton with a smug air and headed into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Daniela stepped out of the bathroom, only to find a crowd of McCoy family members charging in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid beside her began to tremble, clearly scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The McCoy family&#39;s overwhelming presence filled the room with tension. &#34;Where&#39;s Daniela?&#34;</p>
