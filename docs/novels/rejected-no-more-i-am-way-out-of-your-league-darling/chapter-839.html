                <p>Cedric arrived home carrying a storm inside his head, shoulders tense as he slumped onto the living room couch in search of calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for a blank sheet of paper, mind wandering back to the strange diagram Arthur had sketched-the pattern of black dots etched clearly in his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Cedric redrew the configuration, each mark placed with methodical precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he stared at it, he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it resembled some kind of model.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxious energy prickled beneath his skin. He balled up the page, flinging it into the trash. a heartbeat later,took it out, unsatisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to erase all evidence, he fed the crumpled sheet into the shredder and stood watch until it was pulverized. Only then did heexhale, making his way into the kitchen to start on dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela and the others gathered at the table, Cedric quietly slipping out with the shredder tucked under his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol squinted at him, curiosity bubbling over. &#34;What&#39;s he doing now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few uncertain glances, Daniela raised her shoulders in a shrug that said she had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the maid breezed in, explaining that Cedric was setting objects aflame to leave no trace behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol and Daniela locked eyes, confusion swirling between them. Neither could make sense of Cedric&#39;s strange determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ensuring the remains were reduced to ash, Cedric finally returned inside, finishing up the meal in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started toward the staircase, ready for a hot shower, when something in the living room made him freeze mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where on earth did you get this?&#34; he growled, his voice rough and dangerously low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s glare was sharp enough to cut steel. He slammed Damon against the guest room wall, his fingers tightening around Damon&#39;s collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gasped for breath, struggling to pry Cedric&#39;s grip from his throat.&#34;Are you insane? Cedric, let go!What the hell&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze dropped to the crumpled sheet between them. The diagram of black dots leaped out at him-a perfect replica of the one he&#39;d drafted. &#34;How did you get this? Were you spying on me?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t spying!&#34; Damon shot back, rubbing his throat and shooting Cedric a wounded look. &#34;I happened to be in the surveillance room and saw someone doodling this in the conference room. I just thought it looked interesting and sketched it for fun. Why are you flipping out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression only darkened further, his stare icy. &#34;What made you decide to draw it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did it just to kill time. What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric studied Damon&#39;s face, searching for any sign of a lie. &#34;Do you have any idea what this even is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, it&#39;s a psychological framework diagram. Whoever drew it tried to hide its true meaning, but the pattern&#39;s pretty standard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes narrowed to slits. &#34;Then tell me-what do these black dots stand for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Cedric&#39;s steely glare, Damon hesitated asked, &#34;Why the sudden interest? Let me guess. The other day in the surveillance room, I saw a man facing Carol and Daniela. He was watching one of them-based on this diagram, he was focused on Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the pattern of black dots. &#34;Daniela is detached, analytical, keeps people at arm&#39;s length. But when it comes to those close to her, she&#39;s almost endlessly forgiving. She&#39;ll put up with anything for her own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon studied the remaining dots. &#34;And here-these are her weaknesses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sent a dark chill flickering across Cedric&#39;s face, his expression sharpening with a dangerous edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to the storm brewing beside him, Damon went on, &#34;She&#39;s distant-never easy to approach. Even if you think you&#39;re close, you never really make it past her walls. She avoids digging into anyone&#39;s feelings. Her weakness is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon suddenly looked up, blurting,&#34;Daniela&#39;s afraid of blood, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That guess landed like a spark on dry tinder. Cedric&#39;s murderous intent surged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers closed around a fruit knife in his pocket, knuckles white, ready to strike. Before the tension could snap, a knock thudded at the door, shattering the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon glanced away, missing the flash of steel in Cedric&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Carol&#39;s got a game and she wants you there,&#34;Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Damon replied absently. As he brushed past Daniela, he couldn&#39;t help but probe. &#34;Daniela, seriously -are you scared of blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught the strain etched deep in Cedric&#39;s brow, his hand clenched tight around the knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the nonsense and get moving!&#34; Daniela shot back, her voice cool but laced with warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon strolled off to join Carol, completely unaware of how close he&#39;d come to disaster. In theliving room,Carol grinned. &#34;You&#39;ve got lucky today, you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon let out a laugh, the sounds of gunfire from the game filling the air, blissfully ignorant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shot Cedric a weary look as he seethed beside her. &#34;Cedric, let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze cut through her like frost. &#34;The only people who keep secrets are the dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a weary sigh. People called her cold, but compared to Cedric, she seemed almost warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, knowing full well that telling Cedric Damon was his brother would mean nothing to him. Instead,she murmured softly, &#34;Don&#39;t kill someone at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice came out low, unbothered. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll take care of him outside, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gently pried his hand from the fruit knife and set it on the table. &#34;I like your hands better when they&#39;re making dinner, not covered in blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s mouth opened, ready to argue, but Daniela cut him off. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Just warn him. Damon isn&#39;t the type to run his mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glint flickered in Cedric&#39;s eyes, visions of twisted retribution running wild through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela couldn&#39;t help but laugh softly.&#34;Still mad at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze snapped to hers, caught off guard. &#34;Mad about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, voice softer. &#34;Because I hid things from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Cedric remember his simmering resentment, and his expression clouded over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela closed the distance, pressing up on her toes, to brush a kiss against his lips.&#34;Consider this an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever tension Cedric still carried melted away, replaced by a quiet, boyish delight.&#34;That&#39;s it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered with another quick kiss, making him grin from ear to ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his mood thoroughly sweetened, Cedric strode off to handle Damon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone, Daniela leaned against the door, amusement flickering in her eyes. HowN could a man this ruthless be so easy to appease?</p>
