                <p>Every strand of hair on Katrina&#39;s body prickled as she absorbed Daniela&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in shock, meeting Daniela&#39;s gaze. Unintentionally, she exclaimed,&#34;What do you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela heard this, her smile grew even wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a reassuring smile; instead, it was the kind that sent a shiver through Katrina&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela advanced slowly, her steps deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Katrina moved back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined that the little girl she had once bullied, the one who would sit at the stairs with a bowl,eating quietly, had now turned into someone who could make her shrink back with just a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of regret hit Katrina. She regretted not dealing with Daniela permanently, much like she had with Brylee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think I know?&#34; Daniela asked, her voice calm yet filled with cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stood there, frozen, for what felt like an eternity. She couldn&#39;t find the words to respond to that question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the true meaning of Daniela&#39;s words slowly sank in, a cold shiver ran down her spine, freezing her blood in its tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Se trembled, the coldness seeming to penetrate her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she regained her composure, she found herself alone in the living room, engulfed by fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to her husband, Katrina said, &#34;Caiden, Daniela is targeting Joyce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had just come home,slightly buzzed from an evening out. He laughed it off with a dismissive wave. Katrina raised her voice, desperate. &#34;I&#39;m serious! Daniela&#39;s distributed dividends of the robotics firm frequently, and her glare just now... it was as if she wanted me dead. You&#39;ve seen Joyce grow.We can&#39;t let Daniela harm her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again,Caiden brushed her concerns aside. &#34;Daniela&#39;s got too much on her plate for such pettiness.She wouldn&#39;t target Joyce over something trivial like Alexander. If she wanted to hurt Joyce, why would she have given her shares in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina faltered, at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden shrugged, relaxed. &#34;She would only be really angry when Brylee was involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without bothering to freshen up, Caiden covered himself with a blanket, lay down, and soon began snoring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, on the other hand, was overwhelmed with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for her phone and dialed. &#34;Mom, I think Daniela remembers what happened to Brylee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? That happened so long ago. Don&#39;t work yourself up. Even if Daniela suspects something, does she have any proof? She was only five when Brylee died. Can you remember anything from when you were five?By now, she&#39;s probably forgotten it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression darkened, and her voice dropped to a murmur. &#34;Five years old... Surely she remembers more than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Briefly hesitating, Katrina then instructed, &#34;Mom, we need a hypnotist, but not the old one. Find someone young and attractive. I intend for Daniela to meet her mother&#39;s fate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she hung up, Katrina glanced nervously towards the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in thoughts of Brylee, she realized she had neglected her usual cautions. She picked up a fruit knife and paused by the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand clenched tightly around the knife, her determination firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Caiden continued to snore, unaware of the tension. Katrina exhaled slowly, her nerves easing slightly. She scolded herself internally to remain vigilant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Daniela turn the tables on her after all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina headed to the bathroom to freshen herself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Caiden&#39;s eyes fluttered open in the bedroom. His hand was damp, his grip uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp edge of the fruit knife glinted menacingly on the nightstand. A bead of cold sweat trickled down Caiden&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wiped his brow roughly, his hand shaking, then closed his eyes once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence surrounded the room again, as though the night had swallowed the ealier disturbance.</p>
