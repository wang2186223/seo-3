                <p>The answer was a simple.&#34;OK.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Natalie fell asleep smiling.When she sold the villa,she told the buyer that she would vacate the villa in a week. By then,she assumed Daniela would be dead,and she could move into Daniela&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next move was clear:take over Harper Group and the local operations of Elite Lux. She pondered whether Cedric would be smart enough to accept her.If he remained oblivious,she would enlist Linden&#39;s help to handle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie imagined a flawless execution of her plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sleep was peaceful, her face still wearing that smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she made her way downstairs the following morning.Natalie hummed a melody, her dress cascading gracefully.Elyse watched her with a curious gaze. &#34;What&#39;s got you in such high spirits today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a forced smile,Natalie remained silent,her expression smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mid-breakfast, Elyse turned to her. &#34;I forgot to ask yesterday.What was that document you had me sign?&#34; Wiping her mouth with a napkin, Natalie responded.&#34;Merely a power of attorney.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of any underlying motives, Elyse said, &#34;What business are you launching on? You know,Brylee gave me this villa as a retirement haven, my safeguard.I must hold on to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking away, Natalie answered dispassionately.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she finished her breakfast, Natalie set off for work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had been observing Natalie intently and later slipped into Daniela&#39;s office, murmuring, &#34;Something&#39;s unusual with Natalie today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela quirked an eyebrow, amusement flickering across her face. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina explained, &#34;She&#39;s unusually cheerful,wearing that lavish dress, and even changed her lipstick shade.Usually, she has a long face. Today,she seems different. Something&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply nodded. &#34;We&#39;ll let her keep her mysteries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still concerned, Nina kept her gaze sharply on Natalie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Entering the office casually, Natalie asked, &#34;What mysteries?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laughed lightly and asked, &#34;What mysteries? Surely,you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s smile briefly wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Daniela implying something about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie remained frozen in a daze, while Daniela abruptly lifted her head, their eyes locking in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, unwavering clarity lit up Daniela&#39;s eyes.stopping Natalie in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you the one keeping mysteries?&#34; Daniela pressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie saw Daniela&#39;s smile vanish, her expression growing serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped a beat, and she stammered, &#34;What do you mean, Daniela? I&#39;m lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when Daniela&#39;s smile returned that Natalie exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the worry? I was merely joking,&#34; Daniela said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie exited the office, her heart pounding randomly,a surge of fear washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment,something in Daniela&#39;s look hinted at her deeper awareness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie took a hearty swig of water, seeking solace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a laugh, trying to convince herself. &#34;Why should I be scared? Daniela won&#39;t be around much longer. What threat could she pose? Surely,she&#39;s no match for Cealmaur&#39;s mercenaries. Absurd!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slowly ticked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie greeted the first day with a broad smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nerves were steady on that initial day,trusting in Cealmaur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second day found Natalie still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reassured herself,given it was only day two,that assassination could happen in an instant; patience was key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the third day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the fourth day drifted by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,all remained quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the fifth day, Natalie found herself obsessively watching Daniela&#39;s office door, anticipating the moment Daniela would meet her unexpected end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cealmaur was known for their stealthy executions:escaping their grasp seemed impossible for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the sixth day dawned, doubts began to cloud Natalie&#39;s mind. Why was Cealmaur delaying? Did they always operate so close to the wire? Such delays made her question whether the deed would ever be done.Natalie&#39;s nerves started to unravel under the weight of her thoughts. Sensing her unease. Nina walked over and asked, &#34;What&#39;s making you so restless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie&#39;s voice cut sharp as she yelped.Leave me alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seventh day arrived.</p>
