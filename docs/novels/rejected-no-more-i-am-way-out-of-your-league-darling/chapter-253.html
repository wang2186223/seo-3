                <p>While Shirley bided her time, she was far from inactive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the game of seducing men, Katrina believed Shirley played a smarter hand than Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Shirley circled Cedric like a hawk, Caiden warned, &#34;Take this seriously, Katrina. Don&#39;t stir the pot with Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, turning to give him a curious look. &#34;Well, well, I thought you had taken a vow of silence.Seems you can still speak after all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes danced with mockery as she probed, &#34;What&#39;s the matter now? Think Daniela&#39;s your new champion, and you&#39;re ready to curry favor? You certainly know how to sail with the wind, Caiden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to curry favor with her, but that would require Daniela giving me the time of day,&#34; Caiden retorted with frankness. &#34;I&#39;m not here to chat with you. I&#39;m warning you-don&#39;t poke the bear with Daniela. Shemay not sweat the small stuff, but cross her lines, and she can make your life a living hell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden eyed Katrina&#39;s scornful smirk and added, &#34;Don&#39;t underestimate her. I&#39;m concerned you might just get us thrown out of this villa. It&#39;s always the still waters that run deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina smirked, unimpressed. &#34;Oh really? And just how terrifying might that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A woman like her didn&#39;t climb to her current heights by playing the damsel. Get the picture?&#34; Caiden replied,his tone matter-of-fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a knack for cutthroat tactics in the business realm, one would quickly be swallowed whole, leaving not a trace behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, cloistered from the corporate battlefield, wouldn&#39;t grasp such complexities. Before her marriage to Caiden, she was but a housemaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could she truly comprehend? Her expertise lay solely in the arts of coquettlsh manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her counsel to Joyce and Shirley on handling men was invariably woven from the same thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing further conversation was futile,Caiden awaited Daniela at the door as she finished her day&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; Daniela inquired, not lifting her gaze from her phone. &#34;I&#39;m swamped right now. If it&#39;s trivial,please step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden asked, &#34;Is Cedric trivial enough for your time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught her attention. Her eyes flicked up fromn her phone to his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stole a glance at her phone, noting a screen filled with figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pocketed her device.&#34;Speak!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden divulged, &#34;Shirley is attempting to charm Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s initial reaction was dismissive, but her hand paused midway to her pocket as Caiden continued,&#34;They&#39;re going to make Cedric take an aphrodisiac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s fingers slowly uncurled. Her face clouded over for a brief moment before she regained her usual poise.&#34;Understood,&#34; she acknowledged, then entered the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela&#39;s composed figure, Caiden couldn&#39;t help but contrast her with Joyce and Shirley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference was night and day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly questioned what he ever found appealing in Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she, after all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie mentioned that Cedric had just returned from his business trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, the door to Cedric&#39;s room swung open. &#34;You&#39;re back.&#34; Daniela nodded. &#34;I thought you were on a business trip! Why are you back so soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric approached, taking her bag as they ascended the stairs together. His voice, low and husky, carried a hint of warmth. &#34;I wanted to be back early. And I missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smile played on Daniela&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley observed their ascent to the room. The apple she had peeled, originally intended for Cedric, seemed redundant now; she ended up eating it herself. Suddenly, a thought struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the servant, she remarked, &#34;Don&#39;t you think Daniela and Cedric seem almost too comfortable with each other? So relaxed...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They look like a couple!&#34; Josie chimed in cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shirley nodded in agreement. &#34;Exactly! Like a couple!&#34;</p>
