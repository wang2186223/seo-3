                <p>Nikolas possessed a sharp awareness of human nature, especially his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of indignation bubbled up within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun on his heel and set off in search of Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance to the living room revealed that Daniela had already stepped out to the garden to take a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief washed over Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze landed on Cedric, who was absorbed in peeling oranges, preparing to squeeze juice for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas rolled his eyes in disbelief. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re like a servant who&#39;s too devoted to his work.&#34; Cedric, undeterred, kept his focus on the oranges,entirely ignoring Nikolas&#39; comment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once more, Nikolas rolled his eyes in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, it struck him-Cedric had never been the warmest person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was detached from most people and things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Daniela was distant, Cedric was outright cold,caring for no one but her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a habit of disregarding others, his attention fixated obsessively on just one individual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone like that was far too detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas was certain that if he had discussed the secretary issue with Cedric, he wouldn&#39;t have been as accommodating as Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela might come off as cold, but there was a hidden softness beneath that exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric had none of that. His shifts in demeanor were reserved only for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People saw Cedric as he appeared with Daniela,which made them unconsciously believe he was easygoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, that was far from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This realization made Nikolas furrow his brow.&#34;Cedric, you&#39;re the head of Lone Wolf, right? Daniela has no idea,does she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s hands moved steadily as he washed the fruit,unaffected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused. &#34;What? Did I get it wrong? Or should I just ask Daniela to be sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nikolas was about to take a step forward, a v/oice rang out from behind him, accompanied by the sound of running water. &#34;You think I&#39;m scared of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas turned to see Cedric loading the oranges into the machine, watching as the sweet juice flowed into the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes at Cedric. &#34;What are you trying to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s voice was calm but cold. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in you or whatever you&#39;re connected to, but if you keep pushing me, neither you nor anyone behind you will enjoy the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric picked up the now-full glass. &#34;What you&#39;re after isn&#39;t what I want. Leave, or you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he carried the glass of juice out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas remained frozen in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric handed the juice to Daniela, a soft smile playing on his lips as he brushed a stray strand of her hair behind her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, he suddenly turned, his dark,brooding eyes locking onto Nikolas&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Nikolas&#39; heart lurched. Only when Cedric looked away did the pressure in Nikolas&#39; chest begin to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled sharply, the unease still clinging to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela finished her juice, Cedric retrieved the empty glass and returned to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated by his own reaction, Nikolas scoffed.&#34;Cedric, with all your talent, why would you suppress your potential just to serve under a woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply couldn&#39;t comprehend it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father always said men were ruled by ambition-a real man wouldn&#39;t let love stand in his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric belonged to the McCoy family, and they didn&#39;t raise romantics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained silent, as though explaining would be pointless-Nikolas simply wouldn&#39;t get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hesitated, reluctant to voice it, but some things couldn&#39;t be ignored. &#34;You&#39;ve known about your identity for a long time, haven&#39;t you?&#34; Cedric rinsed the glass with deliberate care, water running over his long fingers. &#34;Hard not to. I didn&#39;t even have to check to know who Ghos reports to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret churned inside Nikolas. &#34;Then what&#39;s your angle? You can&#39;t tell me you&#39;re not tempted by the McCoy family&#39;s fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s stare was icy. &#34;My name is Phillips, not McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, caught off guard. &#34;You really believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a low chuckle. &#34;Naturally. But if you keep pushing me, I won&#39;t mind taking the McCoy empire for myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas wetted his lips. &#34;I&#39;m not looking for a fight,Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Really?&#34; Cedric set the glass on the rack, his dark gaze locking onto Nikolas. &#34;Then tell me-who&#39;s your new secretary?&#34;</p>
