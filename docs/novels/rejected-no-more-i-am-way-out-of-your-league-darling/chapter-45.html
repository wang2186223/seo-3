                <p>The initial shock on Alexander&#39;s face quickly morphed into a simmering rage as he pulled himself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands curled into tight fists, and he made a vow to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From now on, for the rest of his life, he would act as though Daniela didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was just as dumbfounded by Daniela&#39;s blatant brush-off. When they got back home, Katrina was there, standing impatiently by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So? What happened? Did Daniela agree? How many floors did she hand over?&#34; Katrina asked, her voice brimming with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce let out an irritated sigh, shaking her head.She launched into a detailed recounting of the gala, every humiliating moment and cold dismissal included.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face twisted in shock as she listened.&#34;What? That&#39;s her way of handling men? What an absurd strategy! I&#39;ve never heard of anything so ridiculous. But based on what you&#39;re saying, it sounds like her little scheme blew up in her face.She&#39;s completely destroyed her chances with Alexander now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a smug smile as a satisfied laugh escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. That&#39;s exactly what we need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Bennett family was still aiming for a marriage alliance,Joyce would be their one and only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unlike Katrina, Joyce wasn&#39;t one to scheme with such precision. After catching wind of Daniela&#39;s business meeting scheduled for later that afternoon,she thought she&#39;d take matters into her own hands.She made plans to meet Alexander earlier, setting up what she hoped would look like an &#34;accidental&#34; run-in with Daniela in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Alexander caught sight of Daniela in the Joyce gave Daniela a cheerful wave, but Daniela didn&#39;t even blink in response. Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly amazed. &#34;Unbelievable! After everything that happened yesterday, they still have the audacity to wave at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips tightened, clearly annoyed. &#34;What&#39;s a little pride when she wants a shop space from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she was all too familiar with Joyce&#39;s true nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela paused mid-step, her sharp eyes locking onto Joyce, who was making her way over with Alexander following close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nearby, Lillian couldn&#39;t resist the opportunity to throw in a quick jab. &#34;Well, well, Mr.Bennett,Ms. Holt, have you finally decided to hold a proper discussion? Or should we just cancel these meetings altogether if civility is too much to ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s expression stiffened for a moment, but she plastered on a forced laugh, unwilling to let her irritation ruin her chances at the shop space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed that once she got the shop space, she would not be polite to Daniela anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Let&#39;s find a spot to sit and chat. My treat,&#34; Joyce said through clenched teeth. Inside,frustration churned like a storm, her forced smile stretched so thin it felt more like a grimace than genuine cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couIdn&#39;t hide her amusement at Joyce&#39;s clear discomfort. &#34;Daniela, why don&#39;t we take a seat for a bit?&#34; she suggested, her tone dripping with playful mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, ever tolerant of her friends&#39; antics, noticed Lillian&#39;s teasing mood and gave her a slight nod.&#34;Sure,&#34; she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stretched her smile even widder, though it felt like her face might crack, and gestured for Daniela and Lillian to follow her to a table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were seated, Daniela didn&#39;t even glance at Alexander or Joyce. Instead, she pulled a contract from her bag and began skimming through it, as though they weren&#39;t even there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s lips twitched in a barely concealed sneer.What a performance. Who was she trying to impress with that contract? As if she was drowning in work or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes flicked towards Daniela, quickly scanning the bold title of the document in her hands:Clayton Renovation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, his expression tightened before easing again. Clayton Renovation-so that was it.A competitor to Bennett Group, sure, but still far away from their level of expertise and legacy in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Daniela had even a shred of common sense, she&#39;d know the smart move was to hire Bennett Group for her project. The thought sent a wave of smug satisfaction through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead, speak up,&#34; Lillian said, leaning forward with her chin resting on one hand, her playful gaze bouncing between Joyce and Alexander. &#34;Hey, eyes this way! Why are you staring at Daniela? She&#39;s not in charge here. I&#39;m the one running the show now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce paused, her eyes flicking back to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s attention was fixed on the contract in her hands, her gaze lowered slightly. A ray of sunlight streamed through the window, gently illuminating her, making her already stunning looks seem even more glowing and graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce inhaled sharply, her chest tightening with a bitter sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without looking up, Daniela spoke in a detached tone. &#34;The decisions are Lillian&#39;s responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s eyes brightened. &#34;Ah, I get it! Okay, I&#39;ll talk to Lillian about it then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression tightened. She tapped her nails against the table with a smirk. &#34;Is that really how you speak? Didn&#39;t anyone teach you some manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Her voice was thick with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came here for a favor, right? Then act like it.Show some respect. Look at this-my water glass is empty.How do you expect to have a conversation without a drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce stood to pour the water, but Lillian cut her off.&#34;Hold on. Are we really going to talk business over just plain water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian raised her hand and gestured for the restaurant manager. &#34;You remember that red wine we discussed earlier? The one worth ten million? Go ahead and open it and add it to their bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Joyce gasped, her eyes going wide.&#34;Ten million?&#34; With that kind of money, she could buy a whole collection of designer handbags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Got a problem with that?&#34; Lillian teased, her smile sly. Joyce&#39;s face flushed deep red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;can&#39;t you afford it? That can&#39;t be right, can it? aren&#39;t you the precious daughter of the Harper family?Surely ten million is nothing for someone like you.Or maybe being &#39;precious&#39; doesn&#39;t mean much after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It finally clicked for Joyce-Lillian was intentionally humiliating her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worst part was Joyce genuinely couldn&#39;t afford it. The Harper family wasn&#39;t wealthy enough to throw money around so recklessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling powerless, she turned to Lillian, arms crossed and eyes cold, then glanced at Alexander.Her voice dropped to a soft, pleading tone.&#34;Alexander.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gave a short nod towards the manager.&#34;Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager&#39;s eyes gleamed, and he hurried off to bring the wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clapped her hands, nodding with exaggerated</p>
                
                
                
                <p>glee. &#34;Ah, just as I expected from Mr. Bennett. Ten million spent for the sake of love-how heartwarming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression grew even more grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Joyce couldn&#39;t stop the rush of sweetness that filled her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander had done so much for her today, more than she could have ever imagined. She decided that if Cedric didn&#39;t treat her better, she would choose Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile slowly spread across Joyce&#39;s face as she thought about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lillian couldn&#39;t help but let out a faint,mocking smile.She couldn&#39;t believe how naive Joyce was being.</p>
