                <p>The moment Joseph&#39;s muttering reached Nikolas&#39; ears, he whipped around. &#34;Joseph, why are you tearing down our morale while lifting up Daniela&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph shut his mouth without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sent a mnessage in the group chat. &#34;If we want to make Father change his mind, we have to humiliate Daniela today. Did you all see what&#39;s happening? Some of our own relatives are already trying to cozy up to her.McCoy Group should be ours. Are we seriously going to hand it over to some outsider like Cedric, who showed up out of nowhere? Are you all willing to just sit back and watch that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the message landed, the brothers responded without hesitation. &#34;We won&#39;t accept it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes darkened. &#34;Then follow my lead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright!&#34; the brothers answered in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Charles said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas sent Charles a private message. &#34;I know what you&#39;re thinking, Charles. You&#39;re still holding out hope that Daniela will help you. But think about it. Cedric is her husband. Even if she says she&#39;ll stand with you,can you really trust her? We are your brothers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charles read the message and pressed his lips together tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When no reply came, Nikolas wasted no time. He created a new group chat without Charles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the fresh chat, he wrote, &#34;Charles isn&#39;t thinking straight. Ignore him for now. Just follow me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone checked their screen. After a few moments, quiet laughter and smirks spread across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela left the racetrack, Carol guided her toward the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol shot her a thumbs-up. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;re as awesome as ever!&#34; Daniela chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s been a while since I last rode, but the horse wasn&#39;t bad at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol opened her mouth to say more but paused when she noticed the McCoy brothers approaching from different directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol frowned. &#34;Are they about to cause trouble again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a dry laugh. &#34;They&#39;re hopeless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol scanned the hall carefully. &#34;Someone just called Cedric away. Looks like they&#39;re planning something.Should I bring our team over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head lightly. &#34;No need. The one who called Cedric away is a domestic partner of Phillips Group. He won&#39;t harm Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced at the McCoy brothers, spotting the cold, nasty smiles on their faces. She lowered her voice.&#34;Should I call for backup just in case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela picked up a glass of wine, letting it swirl slowly before taking a sip. &#34;No rush. Let&#39;s first see what they plan to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol nodded just as the McCoy brothers closed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! Pretty impressive, aren&#39;t you?&#34; said Kohen, his words dressed in praise but his face twisted with disdain. &#34;Tell me, what kind of trick did you pull to make the horse obey you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued sipping her wine without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;What&#39;s with the attitude? I&#39;m talking to you. Are you deaf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kohen could say more, Damon cut in with a forced laugh. &#34;Relax, Kohen. It&#39;s nothing but a cheap trick. No need to blow a fuse. Daniela, you like betting, don&#39;t you? How about a little wager with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled, her expression unreadable. &#34;Sure. What&#39;s the wager this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon opened his mouth, but Daniela beat him to it. &#34;Let&#39;s make something clear first. If you lose, you can&#39;t go back on your word again. I won&#39;t be so generous this time. Are you sure you want to risk it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, who had been watching from the sidelines, could not hold back anymore. &#34;Daniela, what&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you mocking us? Saying we can&#39;t hande losing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a soft chuckle. &#34;Isn&#39;t that the truth? If you really can afford to lose, why not bark like a dog like your promised?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; face turned beet red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon quickly waved a hand to cut off the brewing storm. &#34;Forget the drama. No point digging up old dirt.Let&#39;s settle it now. Are you betting or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a casual shrug.&#34;What&#39;s the game?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon grinned. &#34;Something simple-dice. Whoever rolls the highest wins!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Damon and Duran were known for their obsessionwith gambling. They had even opened a casino in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oiscoll, where they reigned as self-proclaimed experts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon raised his chin, looking Daniela up and down. &#34;So? Do you dare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set down her glass. &#34;I&#39;m game for anything. Tell me the stakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; mouth curled into a sly grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon&#39;s reputation as the King of Gambling in Oiscoll was no secret. No one had ever beaten him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas chuckled under his breath, imaging Daniela&#39;s humiliation after she lost.</p>
