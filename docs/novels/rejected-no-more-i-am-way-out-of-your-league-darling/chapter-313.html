                <p>Daniela&#39;s cheeks gradually warmed with a blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color deepened, spreading from the tips of her ears down to her neck, conceáled beneath the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,seldom seeing Daniela this shy, was visibly pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, cupping her face and locking eyes with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle, teasing voice, he asked, &#34;So, was I that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, catching the gleam of desire in Cedric&#39;s eyes-almost predatory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened in alarm. &#34;Cedric, I&#39;m really tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled, touching his nose to hers as he whispered, &#34;Next time, I&#39;ll choose something simpler. This was a first for me. Go easy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was about to reply when Cedric flung back the blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand glided up her smooth abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric mentally promised it was just a light tease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, even if Daniela resisted going further, he always had a way of playfully agitating her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was confident in his self-control now. Yet, the moment he felt her silky skin and heard her subdued,breathy sounds, all restraint dissolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swept up by the moment, Cedric surrendered to his desires, captivated by the woman in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst the fervor, a thought sparked within him. Once he&#39;d embraced such unrestrained wildness, it was difficult to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Past midnight, Cedric enveloped Daniela in a soft blanket and carried her downstairs for a meal. He first reheated some soup for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he began preparing additional dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie, alerted by the sounds, entered the kitchen, but Cedric assured her he was fine on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the dining table, Josie complimented Daniela. &#34;Cedríc is quite skilled in the kitchen. He&#39;s got everything under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a weary smile in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she bent to sip her soup, the blanket slid down. Her loosely fitting top exposed a few red marks at her neckline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josie noticed, then chuckled before her expression turned slightly serious. &#34;You should warn him to take it easy. Going two days without food is too much for anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her concern, Josie felt content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric has always thrived in a lively environment. I&#39;ve seen his home grow empty and him colder each day.Solitary business endeavors are challenging. He has faced many trials alone. His grandmother and I did our best to support him, but it was hardly enough. He was always disciplined, precisely knowing his, limits.Throughout these years, I&#39;ve never observed him care for anyone like he does for you. It warms my heart to see him find true love. I&#39;m thankful you&#39;ve entered his life. Otherwise, I feared he might end up alone. When he asked me to care for you, I didn&#39;t hesitate because any woman who could win Cedric&#39;s heart must be extraordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in a warm blanket and enjoying some hot soup, Daniela looked towards Cedric, who was busy in the kitchen, and a gentle smile crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought to herself how wonderful Cedric was and dreaded the thought of ever losing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katrina and Joyce shared a hospital room in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Katrina broke the silence. &#34;Joyce, you&#39;re young and don&#39;t grasp the dangers of high society&#39;s games. People can die from them. No matter how upset you are, I won&#39;t get involved with Doug.&#34; Joyce gazed coldly out the hospital garden window. &#34;I don&#39;t expect you to go out of your way for me.fhar my methods, and I&#39;m prepared to risk everything, even If it means sacrificing my life.°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following this, Joyce requested a nurse to change her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill gripped Katrina as she remembered Daniela&#39;s willingness to risk everything for her mother,contrasting sharply with Joyce&#39;s readiness to risk only her mother&#39;s well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina sighed deeply, closed her eyes, and tears began to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her injuries, the debt collectors that arrived weren&#39;t deterred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stormed into the hospital, knives at the ready, pressing against Joyce&#39;s already bruised face. &#34;You planned this, didn&#39;t you? You told us Daniela was wealthy and then told Cedric to stick by her side,preventing us from kidnapping her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce shook her head in fright. &#34;I didn&#39;t do that. Why not bring more muscle? Can&#39;t you handle Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, another wound marked Joyce&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still brave enough to talk back? Do you realize who Cedric is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Joyce replied, &#34;Cedric is the CEO of Phillips Group. Are you intimidated by a mere businessman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If so, Daniela&#39;s influence was much larger. Shouldn&#39;t they fear her more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric is Ramon Dillon&#39;s godson, and he&#39;s long been connected to the underworld, more than you know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you concealing more? Is Cedric protecting Daniela merely over business interests?&#34;	0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struck by this, Joyce fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ramon Dillon? The man was known for his ruthlessness. Cedric was Ramon&#39;s godson?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have secrets to tell?&#34; The debt collector eyed Joyce coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, there&#39;s really nothing more. They are merely business partners. Had there been more, it would have been public by.now. Initially, Cedric showed interest in Daniela, but that changed over time.&#34; Joyce paused,then added, &#34;Now, he has feelings for me.&#34;</p>
