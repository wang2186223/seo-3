                <p>As Alexander entered, he noticed his secretary had just ended a phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a casual tone, he inquired, &#34;Who was on the line?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary,seemingly indifferent, responded, &#34;It was Daniela. She&#39;s demanding a divorce and has even scheduled a court session for tomorrow morning at eight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As words hung in the air, Joyce couldn&#39;t help but sneer inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Daniela&#39;s deep affection for Alexander, could she truly be serious about a divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her skepticism, Joyce kept up her innocent act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to Alexander&#39;s arm, pressing herself against him, and spoke with a seductive lilt. &#34;I&#39;m to blame,aren&#39;t I? Daniela must be upset that you were so attentive to me while I was hospitalized. She&#39;s obviously jealous. Perhaps I should apologize to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s soothing touch comforted Joy ce. &#34;Don&#39;t let this get to you. None of this is your fault. Daniela can be quite petty. She wants a divorce? Fine, I&#39;ll go to the courthouse tomorrow and see if she really means it!&#34; -</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an exaggerated look of surprise, Joyce tilted her head and replied, &#34;Alexander, don&#39;t act rashly. How could she really want to divorce you? She&#39;s just trying to intimidate you. If you really agreed to divorce her,she&#39;d be embarrassed. Don&#39;t go, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes dark with irritation. &#34;If I don&#39;t go, she&#39;ll keep using divorce to threaten me. Who the hell can stand that?Furthermore, the fire was entirely her doing. Joyce,you didn&#39;t deserve this, and I&#39;ll make sure Daniela owns up to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce bowed her head, a picture of submission,choosing to remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to those present, a chilling, sinister smirk briefly danced across her lips following Alexander&#39;s declaration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That very day, Alexander&#39;s secretary laid out the freshly delivered divorce agreement on his desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning from his meeting, Alexander flicked his gaze over the document&#39;s cover and dismissed it with a cold, disdainful toss into the trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had taken things too far, and this was the final straw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, having delivered the divorce agreement,Daniela retreated to her hotel, a smug sense of finality in her stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always imagined that parting ways wwith Alexander would shatter her,leaving her heart in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as the decisive moment unfolded, the only sensation that enveloped her was a profound,liberating relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had held on to the hollow fantasy of loving Alexander for so long that she&#39;d fooled herself into thinking he was all she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, leaving him proved surprisingly simpler than anticipated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sniffle, she was about to enter the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her eyes, she stopped dead, struck by astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathered before her at the entrance stood the core members of Elite Lux&#39;s design team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the very individuals who had placed their unwavering trust in Daniela, a minor, when the company was just blossoming. They had stood by her side, except when she had chosen to marry Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had cautioned her then, adamant that Alexander was not the man for her, but she had dismissed their concerns outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had clung to the belief that true love justified any sacrifice, crossing any distance, with no regrets. ②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, reflecting on those times, she recognized her naivety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing her team, Daniela&#39;s lips twitched into a subtle smile, and her eyes shimmered with tears,overwhelmed by the flood of memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before her, the group formed a perfect row,their joyful faces lighting up the space. &#34;Welcome back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the confines of the hotel, Lillian approached Daniela after the others went to their own rooms.&#34;Daniela, when do we leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite Lux had its headquarters situated far overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Ryan here,&#34; Daniela instructed briskly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While this marriage has to end, I must clear my name too,&#34; Daniela explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian strode across the hallway, pushed open the door opposite Daniela&#39;s, and called out, &#34;Ryan,Daniela needs you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan Parker&#39;s brilliance lay in his obsession with technology, spending most of his time secluded in a server room. But today, he was here for one reason-to welcome Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped entirely in black, his hooded sweatshirt cast shadows over his face, leaving only his pale lips visible beneath the shroud. His complexion, stark and ghostly,gave him an unmistakable vampire-like aura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,what can I do for you?&#34; Ryan&#39;s tone was calm,with a hint of curiosity.</p>
