                <p>Cedric gave her a sulking look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft chuckle, Daniela teased,&#34;Calm down,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then slid off him, quickly dressed, and retrieved her phone from the nightstand to contact Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian responded promptly on the call. &#34;Daniela?Aren&#39;t you home? I&#39;m right outside your door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glance at Cedric, who sprawled on the bed looking dejected, Daniela responded with a gentle smile, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian immediately adopteda more grave tone. &#34;It&#39;s important!&#34; &#34;Give me a moment; I&#39;ll meet you downstairs,&#34; Daniela said into the phone. Cedric&#39;s expression grew even more somber as he overheard. After ending the call,Daniela leaned down and shared a lingering kiss with Cedric, leaving them both short of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric then rose to get dressed, his demeanor still one of mild annoyance. &#34;You owe me one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela agreed with a smile, nodding. &#34;Absolutely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s face brightened when he checked the time.&#34;Let&#39;s make this brief. Return straight here after your discussion downstairs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,neither found their way back upstairs that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending together, Daniela and Cedric normally encountered Lillian&#39;s playful remarks during such moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grave look marred Lillian&#39;s face as she stared at Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Daniela inquired, sensing the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian silently extended her phone towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was swamped with trending news, all centered around Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Scandal Surrounds Cedric!&#34; &#34;The Illusion of Cedric&#39;s Loyalty Destroyed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Caught with Three Women!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Revealed: Cedric&#39;s Scandalous Video!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s Passionate Night with the Graves Sisters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Deceit of Cedric Uncovered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s Betrayal of Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian said, &#34;This isn&#39;t just trending here; Cedric&#39;s scandal has flooded the entire internet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan chimed in, &#34;This has gone beyond our borders.International platforms are also ablaze with condemnation of Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian faced Ryan, asking urgently, &#34;Have you found anything conclusive? What does the technical analysis say about the authenticity of that so-called scandalous video?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the phone aside, Ryan looked towards Daniela,then Cedric, and sighed. &#34;There&#39;s no evidence of tampering. The video appears authentic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock registered on Lillian&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s expression turned to one of disbelief and resentment as he stared at Cedric. Despite the tension, Daniela remained composed.&#34;That isn&#39;t Cedric in the video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan,visibly upset, asked, &#34;Daniela, how can you still defend him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head calmly. &#34;Check the video&#39;s timestamp. It&#39;s dated the day after the family banquet.Remember what was happening then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of realization hit Lillian. &#34;Yes, I recall now!That was the day Ryan suffered a bad bout of food poisoning,and Cedric was by his side the entire night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan was visibly shocked. He checked the timestamp closely. Indeed, it was true. &#34;Who could possibly be in the video then?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was equally astonished, scrutinizing the video again and again. He fixated on the face that mirrored his own,rendered speechless for a considerable time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing his lapotop, Ryan said, &#34;I&#39;m going to pull the video offline immediately! Who is this doppelganger,and how could he impersonate Cedric to such an extent? This must be a deliberate frame-up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Cedric&#39;s phone was incessantly buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The public relations team was in disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t fathom Cedric engaging in such  behavior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the damning nature of the online evidence,they scrutinized the video over and over, yet found no clues to suggest the man wasn&#39;t Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, even some skeptics online refused to believe the claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sent the so-called explicit video for forensic analysis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resulting verdict was blunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The individual in the video is undeniably Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the storm of public opinion reached its zenith, the mastermind behind the chaos delighted in the turmoil,introducing yet another explosive element-a recorded conversation amid the fervent discussions.</p>
