                <p>Harper Group had been hanging by a thread, flirtíng with ruin for what seemed like forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, having severed all financial aid to Caiden, left him without a cent to his name. Overwhelmed by desperation, he finally let go of his ego and reached out to Cedric for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s initial plan was to reach out to Alexander for assistance. Yet, Katrina shattered this notion with a scathing comment. &#34;Seriously? You can&#39;t even take care of your own mess, and now you want to screw up your son-in-law&#39;s life too? Are you trying to make Joyce the laughingstock of the Bennett family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling crushed and shamed, Caiden reluctantly discarded the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitter moment unveiled Katrina&#39;s true intentions.Her prior endearments and praises were nothing more than a charade, cleverly orchestrated to  manipulate him and exploit the Harper family&#39;s wealth to land Joyce a prosperous match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she had secured her daughter&#39;s future,Katrina&#39;s facade of concern dissolved. The once docile and accommodating woman had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brewing with resentment yet trapoped by his financial destitution, Caiden realized his dire situation. Devoid of funds and influence, and dependent on Katrina even for daily essentials, he was forced to navigate his days with utmost caution around her dominating presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Katrina&#39;s temper flared, she would not tolerate Caiden&#39;s presence at the dinner table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time and again, Caiden was left to sit at the bottom of the staircase, his meals accompanied only by the weight of his solitude. These moments inevitably led his thoughts to wander to Daniela&#39;s early years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she experienced this same feeling of exclusion and isolation within her own family home? She was merely a child of five back then. The idea sent a cold shudder rippling through Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drowning in a deep pool of embarrassment and helplessness, Caiden was too dauunted to seek Daniela&#39;s assistance. The onlookers, it seemed,thrived on his predicament, eagerly watching for him to falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding himself cornered by circumstance, Caiden approached Cedric, his demeanor meek, his eyes cast downward in a gesture of deference. &#34;I&#39;m at a loss here. Daniela now controls Harper Group, yet she&#39;s letting it flounder. The company continues to bleed funds, its worth diminishing by the day. Even though she isn&#39;t exactly strapped for cash, watching such wastage is baffling. Real money is just being squandered away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes held a frosty detachment, radiating an imposing sense of authority. &#34;She has her reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what am.I supposed to do?&#34; Caiden asked, his voice faltering as he nervously chewed his lip.I can&#39;t even afford a damn cabbage at my age. Fifty years of living for this? Every day feels like hitting rock bottom again. What&#39;s left for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his gaze, Cedric&#39;s face remained an impassive mask. &#34;Oh, really? Then perhaps it&#39;s time you confronted the person who dragged you into this mess. Don&#39;t ask me or her for answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill seemed to pass through Caiden, freezing him in place. &#34;I know. I&#39;m painfully aware of my shortcomings as a father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crack appeared in Cedric&#39;s composed exterior as he let out a derisive snort. &#34;If you were truly aware,you&#39;d spare us the charade of calling yourself her father. Stop dressing up your guilt in fancy excuses.You&#39;re not fooling anyone, and honestly, you&#39;re just making us both sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden finally realized Cedric wasn&#39;t just annoyed-he was absolutely done putting up with his useless crap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head, shrouded in a heavy silence. As Cedric began to turn away, Caiden finally asked, &#34;If| apologize sincerely, do you think Daniela will forgive me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s gaze was as sharp as steel, chilling him to the core. &#34;You tell me. Isn&#39;t self-awareness the bare minimum for a man? You got what you were after,and now you&#39;re trying to take it all back? Pathetic.Have you no dignity left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Caiden could muster a response, Cedric continued, &#34;Even if you&#39;ve thrown away whatever shred of dignity you had left, you should be sensible,don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned sharply and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden remained, rooted in the stinging breeze, his face tight with frustration. His nose blushed crimson from the biting cold, and his heart sank into an abyss, dark and seemingly bottomless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As weeks turned into a bleak month, the burden grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s frequent outings to dine meant that the kitchen at home lay dormant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On such evenings, the task of cooking fell on Caiden&#39;s reluctant shoulders. While savory scents floated tantalizingly from Daniela&#39;s dining room,he could only gulp down his bitterness and silently grieve over his dreary circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, the wind howled outside, relentless and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a full week since Katrina had retreated to her mother&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, having devoured the last of his noodles,faced the barren shelvesof his kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by hunger, he abandoned his pride and, plate in hand, made his way to Daniela&#39;s dining room. He settled himself at the table, disregarding the piercing stares from everyone seated there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, Lillian, and the others shot wary looks at one another before all eyes turned to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held her fork midair for a brief second, her face a mask of indifference, before she continued eating as though nothing unusual had occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the meal concluded, Caiden gathered his courage. His voice barely above a whisper, he addressed her. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned her gaze towards Caiden. &#34;There&#39;s no need for thanks. How did you find the meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden offered a sincere reply. &#34;It was really delicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle nod came from Daniela. &#34;I&#39;m pleased to hear that. Although we aren&#39;t close personally, you&#39;re always welcome to dine here. Just so you&#39;re aware,the meal here is $1,000 per person. How would you like to handle the payment? Cash, card, or would you prefer to settle up at month&#39;s end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was rooted to the spot, his voice lost to surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile, Daniela went on, &#34;Whichever method you choose, payment is due. If paying per meal suits you, Josie will take care of it. Please understand, I don&#39;t offer credit here. After all,supporting someone else&#39;s father isn&#39;t my responsibility,is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she turned on her heel and departed, leaving Caiden to grapple with a mix of embarrassment and frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Daniela had taken a shower, she headed down the stairs, only to be greeted by Josie, who was grumbling over Caiden&#39;s failure to pay and his bold excuse of being broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Daniela&#39;s eyes flicked towards Caiden before she pulled out her phone and sent a quick message to Katrina.</p>
