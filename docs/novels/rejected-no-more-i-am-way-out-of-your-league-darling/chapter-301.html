                <p>Even with the best reconstructive surgery, restoring Joyce&#39;s appearance seemed almost impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden found himself stunned yet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout it all, Daniela sat unbothered, her attention locked on the television as if nothing unusual had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep, gnawing fear began to settle in Caiden&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t merely fear of Daniela&#39;s influence-it was a bone-deep dread, as if he were staring into the face of a living nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Katrina stayed upstairs long past midnight,tirelessly caring for a traumatized Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she eventually came downstairs, exhaustion consumed her, and she nearly crumpled at Daniela&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m begging you, please save Joyce! A hundred million might be a fortune for most, but for you, it&#39;s nothing but just a drop in the ocean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela turned off the television, her eyes finally settling on Katrina. &#34;You&#39;re right, a hundred million doesn&#39;t mean much to me. But tell me, why should I save Joyce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s voice trembled with desperation. &#34;If you don&#39;t help, they&#39;ll kill her. They&#39;ve already beaten her,slashed her-her body is covered in scars. They said they&#39;ll sell her if we don&#39;t pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile. &#34;And what exactly, does any of that have to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina froze, biting her lip to keep herself from breaking down. &#34;I understand this isn&#39;t your problem,but after all, we&#39;re family, aren&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s response was icy. &#34;I do have family, but it&#39;s certainly not you. Whether Joyce lives or dies is irrelevant to me.&#34; With that, she rose from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s fists tightened as she stared at Daniela&#39;s icy expression, a chill spreading through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden instinctively stepped back, determined to avoid being drawn into the confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you&#39;re seriously not going to do anything?&#34;Katrina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela cast a mocking glance at Katrina. &#34;Can&#39;t take it anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression froze, her pride battling with her desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice dripped with disdain. &#34;Begging doesn&#39;t suit you, so why bother? Why not drop the act? Your pathetic sob story is sickening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s face stiffened again, and her lips pressed into a firm line. Using her hands, she pushed herself to her feet. She cast a sharp glance at Daniela before slowly shifting her gaze to Caiden. Fear flickered in Caiden&#39;s eyes. &#34;Why are you looking at me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s gaze was earnest as she addressed Caiden.&#34;Caiden, I&#39;ve served you for nearly twenty years.I may not have achieved much, but l&#39;ve always given my best. Please, talk to Daniela.If she agrees to save Joyce, I promise to serve you for the rest of your life,just like I always have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried a heartfelt sincerity as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden hesitated, stealing a nervous glance at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laugh cut through the air just as he was about to say something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caiden, let&#39;s skip the fact that you no longer have any influence over me. Even if you did, do you honestly think Katrina&#39;s worth a hundred million?How funny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cruel remark drained the color from Katrina&#39;s face. Caiden&#39;s lips tightened as he stepped back, throwing Katrina an awkward shrug. &#34;This is between you two.Don&#39;t drag me into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Katrina frown, Caiden added hastily,&#34;Joyce isn&#39;t even related to me anymore. Frankly, I shouldn&#39;t have let her in tonight. The fact that she has a room here is me being generous. Don&#39;t involve me-Daniela&#39;s ruthless, and I want no part of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina had long known that Caiden couldn&#39;t be trusted.Yet she hadn&#39;t anticipated that two decades of shared history could crumble so effortlessly under a few biting words from Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; Katrina wiped her tears and took a steadying breath. &#34;Then let&#39;s talk divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s eyes darted nervously to Daniela, who remained silent with an unreadable expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to gauge Daniela&#39;s thoughts, Caiden dared not say a word. All he wanted was to vanish into thin air. &#34;Regarding the divorce, I&#39;ll go along with whatever Daniela decides,&#34; Caiden mumbled at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina turned to face Daniela. &#34;Here&#39;s the deal: this villa, half Harper Group&#39;s shares, and Caiden&#39;s personal assets converted into cash. Just give me a hundred million in total, and I&#39;ll divorce Caiden right away. I know you don&#39;t want me here, Daniela. Pay up, and Joyce and I will disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, let out a laugh. &#34;Is this how you ask for help? Let&#39;s be clear-you&#39;re the one in a rush, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s sharp retort left Katrina momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door clicked open, and Cedric entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had never felt so relieved to see Cedric in his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushingto Cedric&#39;s side, Caiden leaned in and whispered urgently, &#34;You&#39;ve got to do something about Daniela. She&#39;s absolutely out of control tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric ignored him entirely and strode across the room to take his place behind Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single word escaped his lips, but his presence spoke volumes. He was there as her steadfast protector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s jaw tightened. Dealing with Daniela on her own was already no small feat, but with Cedric standing firmly at her side, it felt like an impossible mountain to climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your endgame here?&#34; Katrina demanded,her voice laced with frustration. &#34;Aren&#39;t you worried that I won&#39;t leave this villa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a casual shrug. &#34;Makes no difference to me. My mother bought this villa. Whether or not Caiden claims me as his daughter, I have my place here.&#34; From his spot near the door, Caiden gave a small nod. &#34;She&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury simmered within Katrina. &#34;What exactly do you want?&#34; she asked, her voice rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood under the glare of the overhead light,her expression calm yet detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes in the room were fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela approached Katrina and leaned in to whisper something into her ear.</p>
