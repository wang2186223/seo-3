                <p>Carol arrived bearing news-Flint had ties to McCoy Group.Daniela,however,showed no real reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What scheme is Hamilton weaving now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she posed the question, Nikolas stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words reached him mid-stride, and he instinctively recoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela held his gaze, then asked evenly,&#34;SOyour father&#39;s still meddling? Still dreaming of Cedric wedding the princess?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas scratched his neck awkwardly.&#34;Um...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned. &#34;But Cedric&#39;s already taken. Why would that princess chase after a married man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas exhaled. &#34;Well, apparently, it&#39;s your husband&#39;s appearance. She saw him once and instantly became smitten. Then, my father told her...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone sharpened. &#34;Told her what, exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas hesitated, then muttered, &#34;That you mistreated Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela blinked, stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time someone gossiped about the princess&#39;s infatuation, Daniela had brushed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Cedric was remarkable-being admired was expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And admiration, in itself, didn&#39;t offend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was actually quite pleased that someone liked Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But pursuit born of delusion and deceit? That was different. She typically gave Cedric space in his dealings, but that didn&#39;t mean she&#39;d tolerate blatant interference,especially when cruel fabrications were involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression hardened. A staff member who had entered to finalize paperwork took one look at her face,abruptly turned, and made a hasty exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further discussion, Daniela dialed Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas, unsettled by her glacial demeanor, instinctively backed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call connected after one ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Hamilton&#39;s secretary who picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Connect me to Hamilton. Now,&#34; Daniela demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary, trying to sound composed, replied, &#34;I&#39;m afraid Mr. McCoy is tied up at the moment. Do you have an appointment? If not, I&#39;m afraid Mr. McCoy is unavailable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Hamilton was lounging, nibbling fruit, quite pleased by his secretary&#39;s stalling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, abruptly, the secretary&#39;s expression dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned forward. &#34;What happened? What did Daniela say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shielding the mouthpiece with her hand, the secretary leaned toward Hamilton and murmured,&#34;Daaniela insists you answer now-or she&#39;ll march to the Loglil king and accuse you of instigating his daughter to steal her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Hamilton sprang from his seat and hastily grabbed the phone. &#34;Daniela! Have you lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s tone was icy. &#34;It appears I wasn&#39;t wrong. The king is unaware that his ideal candidate for son-in-law is my devoted partner. He also doesn&#39;t realize his daughter is chasing a man who has no plans of leaving his wife. This mess? All your doing. Do you think the princess is aware you&#39;re toying with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had unraveled everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood precisely what haunted Hamilton most. &#34;You...&#34; Words failed Hamilton as dread tightened in his chest. Daniela was unnervingly sharp. He struggled to keep up-and his sons wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite lacking the full context, she had seen straight through his schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was truly frightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela posed a grave threat to the McCoy family&#39;s stability. If she remained in Oiscoll, near their sphere of influence, McCoy Group would eventually fall into her hands. The family would be none the wiser as she stripped them of their assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a fate had to be prevented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman of her caliber? The world had no place for her kind.</p>
