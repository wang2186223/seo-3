                <p>The clay figurine made a lasting impression on Tasha,because it was known to be extremely valuable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brylee had originally bought it at an auction to give to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, it was sold at auction for more than 50million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha always took extra care when cleaning around the figurine,fearful of accidentally damaging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever Jack expressed a desire to play with it,Joyce would firmly remind him that it was a special gift from Daniela&#39;s mother and off-limits to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This morning, I saw it still in front of the TV while l was cleaning,&#34; Tasha said, rushing downstairs. After a brief inspection, she returned upstairs, her face ashen.&#34;t really is missing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha was visibly distressed. &#34;I didn&#39;t take it. Please believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the figurine&#39;s high value, she was understandably frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you,&#34; Daniela said gently. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. It seems we have a thief among us. I&#39;ll figure out a way to catch them. Let me know when the house will be empty, and I&#39;ll arrange for someone to install some hidden security cameras. I want to see who&#39;s secretly taking things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha nodded in agreement. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Tasha returned downstairs and entered the kitchen,Caiden observed her from the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela came downstairs, Caiden asked, &#34;What were you and Tasha discussing upstairs?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond but proceeded to pour herself a glass of water, causing Caiden&#39;s brow to furrow slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a phone call, Cedric walked into the house and made his way to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasha whispered, &#34;We&#39;re missing something important.It&#39;s the clay figurine Ms. Harper treasures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced towards Caiden in the living room, his expression tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, Cedric turned to Daniela and asked,&#34;Would you like me to have someone install cameras in the house?&#34; &#34;I&#39;ve already arranged for someone to handle it,&#34;Daniela responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric breathed a sigh of relief. &#34;Okay. There&#39;s something I need to tell you. The McCoy family is coming to inspect Phillips Group, so I&#39;ll be occupied and plan to stay at the office for the next few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Daniela lifted her gaze to meet Cedric&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose not to tell him that he was awful at lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evident she saw right through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was certain-she knew he was lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Daniela replied. Just as Cedric&#39;s smile began to form, she added, &#34;Either stay here or don&#39;t bother returning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, Daniela then ascended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, who had overheard Cedric&#39;s plans to leave,thought this presented a perfect opportunity. With Cedric away,he could sneak valuables out of the villa to sell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Daniela wasn&#39;t providing financial support,Caiden felt compelled to fend for himself. Caiden said, &#34;Cedric, you&#39;re too soft with Daniela.She&#39;s becoming too domineering. You have responsibilities at the company; it&#39;s not like you&#39;re avoiding coming home. Plus, with her amnesia, she doesn&#39;t even share a room with you. Are you really going to let her control you like this? Are you a man or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression turned into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden,growing more enthusiastic, continued, &#34;You&#39;re the CEO of a company, Cedric. Why do you let Daniela intimidate you? She says one thing, and you&#39;re too scared to leave? Stand up for yourself! Show her your strength! The less you cater to her whims, the more she&#39;ll want you. Don&#39;t you see? If you leave now,she&#39;ll come after you. You&#39;re married, after all. Even if she&#39;s unhappy, you&#39;re still legally tied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Cedric glanced towards Daniela descending the stairs, then back at the fervently talking Caiden,he took a couple of steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Daniela descended and crushed an orange in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden instantly fell silent, intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela looked at him with a serene smile.′′My patience runs thin. Don&#39;t push it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric wanted to discuss his plans with Daniela, but she seemed disinterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized he lacked the courage to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, his subordinate from Lone Wolf called, his voice tinged with impatience. &#34;Boss, are you leaving or not? We&#39;ve been waiting for more than three hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric let out a sigh. &#34;I won&#39;t be leaving today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His subordinate stood at the doorway,eyes widening in shock. &#34;You seriously fear your wife that much? It&#39;s been three hours, and you still haven&#39;t convinced her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night,Nikolas&#39; men completely encircled the villa.</p>
