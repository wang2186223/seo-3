                <p>Ronald&#39;s fists were balled up, his eyes burning with fury. Every muscle in his body was coiled tight, as though he was seconds away from charging at anyone who dared provoke him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stood poised and unbothered, a soft smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed in a stunning white gown from Elite Lux&#39;s latest collection. The dress hugged her tall,elegant frame, the perfect tailoring emphasizing her every curve, while pearls dangled from her ears,highlighting her glowing complexion with understated elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt gritted their teeth, doing everything they could to force Daniela into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of approaching security, Ronald&#39;s gaze turned cold as he leaned closer to Daniela, his voice low and menacing. &#34;We&#39;re at rock bottom, Daniela,and we&#39;ve got nothing to fear from someone with so much to lose. My debts are stacking up, my family&#39;s out of work, and we&#39;re barely scraping by. If you don&#39;t give me an answer today, it&#39;s simple: either you&#39;ll be six feet under, or I&#39;ll climb tothe top of the building and end it all! Blood will spill in front of your precious tower, and then let&#39;s see how well your business runs after that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew how to make a threat feel real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nearly applauded his dramatic performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, who had just entered, shot them a disapproving look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to snap when Daniela held up a hand to stop her. Turning slightly, Daniela winked at her and said in a teasing, yet firm tone, &#34;These are my uncles,Lillian.Show a little respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian blinked, momentarily taken aback, but quickly understood the cue. With a quiet &#34;okay,&#34; she stepped back,folding her arms across her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela faced Ronald and Wyatt again, her demeanor became more sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald and Wyatt were momentarily caught off guard,but their smirks quickly resurfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, Ronald couldn&#39;t contain his satisfaction. No matter how successful Daniela was, he knew she was still beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest swelled with pride, certain that he had the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt watched Ronald with admiration, clearly impressed by what he thought were top-tier negotiation tactics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always knew you were sharp. Smarter than Katrina and Joyce, for sure. Now, let&#39;s cut to the chase.What role can you get us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald misread Daniela&#39;s calmness as a sign of defeat,his confidence growing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole attitude screamed victory, as if the battle was already over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Daniela,Lillian couldn&#39;t hide her contempt. She rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. They were the ones begging. How could they be so clueless about their own situation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed as composed as always, her voice polite yet unwavering. &#34;I&#39;ve always recognized your potential. You just need to find the right opportunities.Otherwise,you would have been in roles like manager,president, or even chairman by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Ronald, who usually exuded arrogance,was momentarily taken aback. But as her words resonated,he found himself agreeing. &#34;Exactly! It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t have the skills, it&#39;s just that no one&#39;s ever truly recognized our potential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt, in contrast, was overcome with emotion.His eyes welled up as he looked at Daniela. &#34;That&#39;s what family does! We understand each other. You&#39;ve always seen what we&#39;re capable of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a slight nod, her smile unshaken. course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald wasn&#39;t completely sold, though. Narrowing his eyes,he asked, &#34;What about the salary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela raised a finger. &#34;Your annual salary? It&#39;s this much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt hesitated, his voice uncertain. &#34;Ten thousand?&#34;It didn&#39;t seem like a lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s smile widened. &#34;One million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s mouth fell open. &#34;What? One million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jobs they had been barely scraping by with only brought in fifty or sixty thousand a year. Yet, Daniela was offering a million right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald nodded eagerly, his face lighting up with greed.&#34;Deal! We&#39;ll start work tomorrow. One million it is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt, just as thrilled, nodded enthusiastically,his mind racing at the thought of such a massive paycheck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A million!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Work, you said? I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not going to happen.&#34;While they were still basking in the excitement of their imagined victory, Daniela smoothly opened the car door and motioned for Lillian to get in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s smile wavered as he watched her settle into the car. His brow furrowed, and his voice turned serious. &#34;What do you mean? Are you messing with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not. You just said it yourself. I should arrange jobs for my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald gave a quick nod. &#34;Correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s face grew serious. &#34;Family comes first for me. Look at Joyce, for example. She&#39;s utterly useless,and she can&#39;t do a single thing. Yet, I still offered her this much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held up a finger again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s eyes widened, thinking Daniela was talking about one million for Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s voice softened, pretending to feel regret,her long lashes fluttering downward. &#34;But after Joyce joined Elite Lux, Caiden cut all ties with me as his daughter. Ronald&#39;s and Wyatt&#39;s eyes went wide in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela continued, &#34;So we&#39;re no longer family. And because of that, I can&#39;t justify helping you or arranging jobs for you. I just don&#39;t get why Katrina had to do this.I had already agreed to let Joyce join the company,but still, she made Caiden sever ties with me. As for me, I&#39;m okay. I&#39;ve got enough money, plenty of people around, and more than enough friends. But you two, and the rest of the family... Without that connection, there&#39;s nothing I can do. My hands are tied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Starting the car with a careful look of regret, she went on, &#34;I suppose the next time we meet, it wouldn&#39;t be right for me to call you &#39;uncles&#39; anymore. Anyway, I&#39;ll be on my way now. Take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela revved the engine, and the car sped away,leaving behind only a cloud of exhaust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald&#39;s and Wyatt&#39;s expressions contorted with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That damn Katrina!&#34; Wyatt hissed, his voice tight with anger as he ground his teeth. &#34;She shoved her daughter into the spotlight and left us in the dust!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronald,barely able to contain his rage, struck the wall with his fist. &#34;Katrina, you played us dirty! Don&#39;t expect us to just sit back and take it!&#34;</p>
