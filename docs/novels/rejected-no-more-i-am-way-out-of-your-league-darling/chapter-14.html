                <p>Joyce spotted Daniela stopping the manager,which affirmed her suspicions. A self-satisfied grin crept across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a raised eyebrow, she taunted, &#34;I got it right,didn&#39;tl?&#34; 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in her flowing, elegant gown, Daniela returned a serene smile. &#34;Indeed, I don&#39;t have a hundred bucks on me right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Daniela&#39;s admission,Joyce could barely contain her glee. Her eyes sparkled with a victorious gleam.Daniela was on the brink of public embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen up, everyone! She just confessed. She doesn&#39;t even have a hundred bucks, but here she is,putting on a show like she&#39;s a millionaire. So, Daniela, are you actually the Elite Lux&#39;s CEO&#39;s mistress, or is this just another one of your pathetic lies? Did you deceive the manager to gain entry to this esteemed establishment?I once thought you were merely superficial and materialistic, but now it&#39;s clear you&#39;re a complete charlatan. Are you aware that such deceit could land you behind bars?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce was thoroughly convinced of Daniela&#39;s duplicity Yet,Daniela observed with a calm demeanor as Joyce embarrassed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Joyce&#39;s theatrical tirade was already causing a stir online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden was the first to comment, his words laden with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela! Will you stop at nothing to tarnish the Harper name? Joyce, inform Daniela that I have cut all ties with her. From this moment forward, her actions and her words are her own. She is no longer my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his outburst, the internet buzzed with reactions from the public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, is her father really casting her aside so publicly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did Joyce just announce? Daniela is linked with the CEO of Elite Lux? Are we talking about the same Elite Lux? The one that&#39;s a titan in the international design industry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must be! Didn&#39;t you catch the location in the background? That&#39;s the iconic tower in Olisvine! Who else but the CEO of Elite Lux could be involved with such a landmark?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela certainly moves in impressive circles if she&#39;s acquainted with someone like the CEO of Elite Lux!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela looks breathtaking today. Did anyone else see her ensemble? It&#39;s thenewest limited edition from Elite Lux. Absolutely stunning, though the price tag is astronomical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, does anyone know how much it costs? I&#39;m tempted myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do! The whole outfit runs over a million-not even counting the heels Daniela was sporting. But, let&#39;s be honest, the exquisite craftsmanship and design of Elite Lux are worth every penny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re entering the domestic market soon. With some luck, the prices will become far more accessible.I&#39;m thrilled at the thought of finally wearing a luxury label myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation shifted away from Joyce&#39;s allegations, centering instead on Daniela&#39;s stunning beauty and grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming with vexation as her conspiracy crumbled,Joyce barked at the camera, &#34;Listen-don&#39;t be swayed by such twisted values! Daniela&#39;s just a climber,hanging on the coattails of the influential! She&#39;s even been forsaken by her own father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, however, remained beside the expansive window, her demeanor composed. A beam of sunlight sliced through the gloom, spotlighting her and casting an ethereal glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A torrent of eager, heartfelt comments overflowed across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! She looks simply divine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s gaze landed on Daniela, and for a moment,she was transfixed by her luminous presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining her composure, she marched up and spat out accusatorily, &#34;Daniela! What filthy schemes did you pull to sink your claws into the CEO of Elite Lux?You&#39;re just a gutter rat dressed in stolen silk!&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s laughter was light but resonant. Gazing into Joyce&#39;s twisted, angry face, she replied with a calm,mocking smile, &#34;Why not gaze into a mirror and see who truly resembles an ugly gutter rat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accentuated &#34;ugly&#34; in a biting tone, her words slicing through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s face flushed a fiery red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Katrina introduced her into the Harper family, endless comparisons to Daniela shadowed her every move. Over and over, they deemed her no match for Daniela&#39;s charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was intolerable for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the stark truth was unavoidable. Her protests only underscored her desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her appearance, a tender sore spot that haunted her endlessly, became Daniela&#39;s cruel weapon, viciously twisted to publicly disgrace her and deepen the wounds she already carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engulfed by fury,Joyce was on the brink of exploding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right when she was about to retaliate, the elevator doors parted with a whoosh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting someone through the opening, Joyce turned to Alexander, her voice filled with anticipation &#34;Alexander, look! There&#39;s Joshua Dennis-the one I&#39;ve been talking about. He&#39;s connected to the CEO of Elite Lux. He&#39;s about to uncover Daniela as the imposter she truly is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce then confidently pointed her livestream camera towards Joshua, waving at him with a radiant smile.&#34;Joshua...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Joshua blatantly ignored her and walked straight to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing a polite smile, he gave a slight bow.&#34;Ms. Harper, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you. I&#39;m Joshua Dennis from Dennis Electronics. We met briefly at an international gala. It&#39;s a genuine pleasure to see you again. My father intended to be here, but unfortunately, his car broke down. I&#39;ve taken the liberty of arranging a dinner. I&#39;d be honored if you joined us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her face etched with disbelief. She gazed at Joshua-typically so haughty and domineering, yet now, he stood before them,subdued and hardly able to meet Daniela&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her incredulity quickly morphed into a sharp, derisive laugh. Clutching Joshua&#39;s arm, she gestured wildly towards Daniela. &#34;Are you freaking insane, Joshua?Did I hear you right? You&#39;re telling me that Daniela-of all people-is the CEO of Elite Lux?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spinning towards her livestream camera, Joyce couldn&#39;t contain her amusement, and her laughter boomed,echoing in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tugging at Alexander&#39;s sleeve, she amplified her tone for dramatic effect. &#34;Alexander, did you hear that?He&#39;s claiming Daniela is the CEO of Elite Lux! Can you believe that? It&#39;s the grandest joke l&#39;ve heard in years!&#34;</p>
