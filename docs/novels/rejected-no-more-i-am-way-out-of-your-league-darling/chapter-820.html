                <p>Nikolas kept his eyes glued to his screen. &#34;Forget it.I&#39;m not going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t waste her energy on persuading him.Instead, she said coldly, &#34;You have half an hour to get your act together. If you&#39;re still a mess when I get back down, you&#39;re leaving this house for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas pressed his lips together, refusing to listen.Just then, Cedric strolled past and said, &#34;I advise you to listen to her. If you get kicked out, no one is going to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas frowned and turned around to snap at him,&#34;You know what, Cedric? You&#39;re henpecked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shrugged. &#34;That&#39;s absolutely true. So think about it, you&#39;ve got thirty minutes. Fix yourself or don&#39;t, it&#39;s your call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he disappeared upstairs. Grumbling under his breath, Nikolas tightened his grip on the video game controller and turned to Carol. &#34;Does she ever bluff with these threats?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol answered plainly, &#34;Nope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela returned downstairs late, Nikolas hadn&#39;t made any effort to tidy himself up, though he did rise from the sofa to save any ounce of pride.&#34;Look, these are the only clothes I&#39;ve got. I&#39;ll just go like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent. If he wanted to humiliate himself, that wasn&#39;t her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a quick, detached glance and headed towards the door, but Nikolas suddenly groaned,exclaiming, &#34;Cedric! Let me borrow one of your suits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas went upstairs to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, amused, stayed behind, quietly chuckling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nikolas returned, his cheeks were flushed with embarrassment, and his discomfort was obvious. Passing Daniela, he reluctantly mumbled,&#34;Fine, you got your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, the group left for the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; arrival beside Cedric drew immediate attention, something he definitely wasn&#39;t thrilled about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Daniela&#39;s icy glare left him no option but to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander approached cheerfully, acting as if Daniela hadn&#39;t publicly embarrassed him earlier. &#34;Daniela! It&#39;s great to see you here tonight. There&#39;s an extraordinary collection tonight, including one of those authentic paintings you favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to charm her again, but Daniela brushed past without a hint of interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, her company had expanded dramatically,becoming a surprising competitor within Oiscoll&#39;s tightly-knit business community. Its growing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>influence was impossible to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Daniela walked in, conversations halted,and respectful eyes focused on her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas found his attention drawn to Daniela as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained calm, without even a trace of a.polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Real power speaks louder than charm,&#34; Carol whispered to Nikolas. &#34;Now you see why Daniela insisted you to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had arrived in Oiscoll with no connections,no advantages. Yet she&#39;d boldly established herself,forcing everyone to acknowledge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Oiscoll, the place where Nikolas had grown up. So, why had he hesitated to make his mark?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Daniela hadn&#39;t spoken, Nikolas finally grasped what she was silently making him to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decisively, Nikolas pressed his lips tight and followed Daniela into the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For far too long, the McCoy family had held a suffocating monopoly over Oiscoll&#39;s economic landscape. Their absolute control had stifled any real competition, leaving the entire country eager to discover just how high Daniela and her empire could climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela settled into a seat at the far left of the front row, composed and silent. To her right, Hamilton sat stiffly, letting out a sharp, disdainful scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare cut through Nikolas and evèn more so through Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them, in his mind, had ever respectedhis authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the auction started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The early items were mostly minor trinkets.When an ashtray caught Nikolas&#39; eye, Daniela leaned over to Carol and told her to bid on it for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas glanced at Daniela in disbelief. &#34;You&#39;re giving that to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at him. &#34;You don&#39;t like it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nikolas hesitated. &#34;I do. I just didn&#39;t expect you to hand it over so easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re misunderstanding,&#34; Daniela replied bluntly,crushing Nikolas&#39; brief excitement. &#34;If the price jumps over a million, forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas paused, visibly disheartened. &#34;And Cedric?What&#39;s his price cap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the question left his lips casually, Nikolas couldn&#39;t shake the flicker of hope behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of him silently wished that the difference between him and Cedric wasn&#39;t as big as it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the auctioneer&#39;s voice echoed across the hall,filled with excitement. &#34;Now, for tonight&#39;s grand finale. It is the Dreamlike Blue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dreamlike Blue wasn&#39;t just any accessory; it was a legendary pair of sapphire cufflinks, admired for both their rarity and historical value. Each gem was truly one-of-a-kind, unmatched across the globe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Centuries ago, they adorned the wrists of a king, but for a thousand years, they&#39;d vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they had resurfaced, displayed under the auction lights, drawing every eye in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Carol whispered to Nikolas, &#34;Daniela is here tonight for those cufflinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas raised his brows, caught completely off guard. &#34;Daniela? She&#39;s into cufflinks? That&#39;s oddly specific. Aren&#39;t those more of a guy thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone knew cufflinks, it was Hamilton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent decades obsessively curating a private collection filed with the rarest and most valuable pairs in existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even bought an entire villa just to showcase them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one auction, a powerful tycoon pushed the bidding so high, soaring to a thousand times the starting price. Yet Hamilton remained unfazed,confidently claiming the prize despite the steep cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Oiscoll, everyone knew about Hamilton&#39;s extravagant obsession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas narrowed his eyes. &#34;Wait, is Daniela trying to provoke my father with this? That would be a disaster. He clearly comes for these tonight, and he won&#39;t back down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave him a sly smile, already anticipating the drama. &#34;Not quite. Cedric&#39;s the one who wants them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol continued, &#34;Cedric collects cufflinks, too.Daniela always spoils him, so tonight? Things are about to get very interesting.&#34;</p>
