                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s executives couldn&#39;t stand by and watch Daniela being pushed into a corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them rose to his feet, his frustration written all over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could say a word, Daniela reached into her pocket and revealed a document. It was a marriage certificate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives were the first to notice that,and they froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the room stared at the document with growing curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes narrowed sharply, a sense of unease twisting in her gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela finally raised the certificate for everyone to see, the room fell into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one was more shaken than the reporter who had spoken out earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His complexion turned ashen as he stared at the certificate.&#34;This is absurd!&#34; he exclaimed, breaking the silence with a laugh that bordered on hysteria. &#34;A marriage certificate? Really? Daniela,are you trying to tell us that you and Cedric are actually married? How could that possibly be true? Given your prominence and Cedric&#39;s status, a wedding between you two wouldn&#39;t go unnoticed. This has to be fake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea seemed inconceivable. If two titans of the business world like Daniela and Cedric had tied the knot, the news would have sent shockwaves through the corporate world. How could something so monumental have stayed under wraps?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This has to be forged!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ryan stepped forward and played a surveillance clip, showing Daniela and Cedric at City Hall,officially registering their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into gasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s real? I know that registrar! She handled my marriage paperwork,too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen her before as well. This is unbelievable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So it&#39;s true? Daniela and Cedric are really married.This changes everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillips Group&#39;s executives, initially as dumbfounded as the reporters, quickly shifted from shock to joy. Their expressions lit up with hope and relief as they exchanged glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a game-changer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The solution to Phillips Group&#39;s crisis had finally appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was no more alone. A celebration was no longer a distant thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse and Natalie, standing at the edge of the press conference, watched the footage unfold on the screen. Slowly, both sank to the floor in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, how could this be possible?&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s eyes were cold, brimming with defeat. How could she have possibly predicted this? Until now,Daniela had kept her marriage to Cedric hidden from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Cedric was invited by Nina to bake pastries,Daniela hadn&#39;t shown any jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,all this time, she had been fooled by Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, what do we do now? We were planning to get rid of Daniela and claim her inheritance, but now she has a legal husband. If something happens to her,Cedric would inherit everything!&#34; Natalie&#39;s voice cracked with anxiety. Elyse&#39;s gaze sharpened. &#34;That means Cedric has to die too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie went pale at the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse turned to her daughter, her voice low and menacing. &#34;Isn&#39;t there someone who&#39;s been pursuing you at the hospital where Cedric is staying? It wouldn&#39;t be too difficult for him to take care of Cedric while he&#39;s bedridden, would it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Natalie&#39;s eyes as she shook her head quickly. &#34;No, Mom. I like Cedric. You promised that if he had a little accident, I could care for him,and we&#39;d grow close. You said I&#39;d be the one with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;But that was before everything changed. Daniela&#39;s wealth must come to us. Don&#39;t you get it? You can always find another man,but a chance to seize Daniela&#39;s wealth doesn&#39;t come often.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears spilled down Natalie&#39;s face as she kept shaking her head desperately. &#34;No, Mom. Please, give me one more chance. I&#39;ll make Cedric fall in love with me.Once that happens, I&#39;ll get him to sign over his fortune.It&#39;ll all be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse fixed her gaze on her daughter, her expression impossible to read. &#34;Have you completely lost it?Cedric isn&#39;t the type to simply give up what&#39;s already  his. And after all this timne, there&#39;s been no indication that he&#39;s interested in either you or Nina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Natalie dropped to her knees in front of Elyse. &#34;Mom, please. Please, just one chance. I swear,I&#39;ll make Cedric love me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s face grew serious. She couldn&#39;t believe her daughter-who had once been so promising-had fallen so completely for a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew then that Cedric could never be allowed to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she gave a slow nod. &#34;Alright. If you&#39;re this set on it, go ahead and give it a shot. Otherwise, you&#39;ll never stop obsessing over it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie,overwhelmed with relief, burst into tears.&#34;Thank you,Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she continued to wipe her eyes, Elyse subtly slipped her daughter&#39;s phone into her own bag.</p>
