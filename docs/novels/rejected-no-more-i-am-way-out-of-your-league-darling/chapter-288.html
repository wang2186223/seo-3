                <p>Alexander made his way down the staircase, only to discover Katrina feigning nonchalance as she watched the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, in the courtyard, Daniela was deep in conversation on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bits and pieces of her chat floated in through the open window. It sounded as though Lillian was inquiring if Daniela fancied a midnight meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s eyes lingered on Katrina once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was preoccupied with an apple, devouring it with increasing fervor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katrina.&#34; Alexander broke the silence abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Katrina nearly leaped out of her skin.&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re practically down to the apple&#39;s skeleton.&#34; Katrina glanced at the apple, paused, then let out a forced chuckle. &#34;I wasn&#39;t paying attention. Did you come to see Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander didn&#39;t reply immediately. His intense stare continued to bore into Katrina, as if he was about to strip away her veneer at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to leave now. If you need to speak with Daniela,go ahead. I&#39;ll leave you two to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina rose hurriedly without waiting for his response, scrambled into a pair of heels at random,and scurried out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her marriage to Caiden, Katrina had always been a stickler for sartorial precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ensembles were meticulously planned, with not a color out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just now, Alexander noticed Katrina was wearing a long black dress paired with garish yellow high heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the exact ensemble Joyce once attempted to wear,which Katrina had adamantly criticized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now here was Katrina, adorned in just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s suspicions about Katrina&#39;s erratic behavior deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opted to remain in the living room, awaiting Daniela&#39;s conclusion to her phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Daniela wrapped up her dialogue with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dialed Daniela. &#34;Katrina&#39;s just left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peeking inside, Daniela noted the now-vacant couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you capture anything worthwhile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, she spilled the beans. But then Alexander appeared out of the blue, and threw a wrench in the works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had orchestrated this scenario meticulously,only for Alexander to unwittingly throw it off course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This did little to improve Daniela&#39;s disposition. Cedric tried to soothe her over the phone. &#34;Let it go.We&#39;ll hatch another plan later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed. &#34;Okay. It&#39;s getting cold out here.Why don&#39;t you come inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, she lingered in the courtyard to compose herself before entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander rose from the sofa. &#34;Daniela, we need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was visibly fatigued. &#34;Let&#39;s talk another day.I&#39;m rather worn out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, Cedric barged through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander hesitated, locking eyes with Daniela, and fell silent for a long stretch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to say something?&#34; Daniela prodded,looking at Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander pressed his lips tightly together, hesitant to disclose his discovery in Cedric&#39;s presence. He believed it was a secret between Daniela and him.It needed no other ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Alexander wrestled with his thoughts, Cedric made his way into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her gaze fixed on Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander finally spoke. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. I heard you&#39;ve been battling sleepless nights, so I got my hands on some supplements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded. &#34;Thank you. That&#39;s very thoughtful.Fortunately, I don&#39;t suffer from insomnia anymore, so I won&#39;t be needing them.&#34; With that, she ascended the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had spent a good part of the night by the door, hoping to record Katrina trying to kill Daniela, was thwarted by Alexander&#39;s untimely arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided to shower. Emerging from the bathroom,he found Alexander had left. He proceeded upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found Daniela lying in her bed, engulfed in gloom Kneeling beside her, he whispered, &#34;It&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll get another shot at this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric persisted, &#34;Do you reckon Alexander picked up on something today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Likely. When he walked in, Katrina&#39;s voice quivered so much, it would&#39;ve been difficult not to notice something was amiss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder why he showed up out of the blue in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stared at the ceiling. &#34;Who knows? Maybe he genuinely came to deliver supplements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric tilted his head to regard Daniela. &#34;Want to try them? He left them on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela rested her head against Cedric&#39;s abdomen and murmured, &#34;No need. I have you now, and sleepless nights are a thing of the past for me.&#34;</p>
