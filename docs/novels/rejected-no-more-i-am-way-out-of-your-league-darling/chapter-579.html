                <p>Nina&#39;s statement was extensive, exceeding ten thousand words, meticulously recounting every injustice she had endured since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Elyse became a public enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nina came home, Elyse stormed towards her,seething with rage. She grabbed Nina by the collar,her grip trembling. &#34;You&#39;ve ruined me! Are you happy now? I should have never brought you into this world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina let out a cold, hollow laugh. &#34;Too bad it&#39;s too late for regrets. You killed Daniela&#39;s mother. You&#39;re the one who deserves to die. You&#39;re finished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was sharp, her laughter like a blade slicing through Elyse&#39;s composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela hadn&#39;t expected Nina to be so unyielding. Later, when Nina returned home, Daniela told her,&#34;Cormac came by. He said there&#39;s no need to replace the lead actress. He&#39;s the latest Best Actor, with a strong fan base. If you want to try again, the opportunity is still there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina shook her head. &#34;I need a break, Daniela. I&#39;m exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sighed, recalling the sincerity in Cormac&#39;s eyes when he had spoken earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said gently, &#34;Just remember to thank him. He&#39;s genuine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the entertainment industry, reputation was everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone who stood by you at your lowest wasn&#39;t just an ally-they were rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had a way of shifting things, and Daniela chose not to say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Nina retired to her room, Ryan entered, his tone grim. &#34;Daniela, Elyse is making a move.&#34; Daniela had originally planned to pressure Elyse into revealing her backers, but Nina&#39;s explosive revelation had accelerated everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s response was steady. &#34;Winslow Flores.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela wasn&#39;t surprised. She glanced at the time-just one day left before Alexander&#39;s promised deadline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from Winslow, the rest members remained within the commerce association.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scoffed. &#34;Alexander is pathetic. He&#39;s already being pushed to the sidelines. Winslow pulled out early-he&#39;s scared you&#39;ll uncover something. He&#39;s sharp.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to be cunning. How else could he have stayed under the radar for so long among such powerful figures? &#34;Daniela, are you meeting Alexander tomorrow?&#34;Lillian asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;No, that won&#39;t be necessary. Initiate a fresh round of acquisitions against all eight of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Who&#39;s first on the list?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela answered, &#34;Hackett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow was an expert at keeping a low profile-she&#39;d let him stay in the shadows a little longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Flores Group, Winslow&#39;s face darkened the moment he saw Elyse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you out of your mind? Showing up here now? Do you want Daniela to find out about our connection?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse looked worn down. &#34;I have no choice-I&#39;m broke. I tried not to reach out, but I&#39;m desperate.What else can I do? Even if Daniela figures it out, I still have to come to you. Your business is booming.You owe me some support, don&#39;t you?&#34; Winslow exhaled sharply, biting back his frustration.He walked to his desk, scribbled out a check, and flung it at Elyse&#39;s face. &#34;Take the money and stay away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely gotten away from the association, and now Elyse turned up. Just his luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse eyed the check, unimpressed. &#34;This isn&#39;t nearly enough. You swore that after Brylee was gone, l&#39;d live in comfort forever. Now that Natalie&#39;s locked up and Nina won&#39;t lift a finger for me, you&#39;re the only one left to support me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s gaze darkened, a dangerous gleam flickering in his eyes. For a brief moment, a lethal intent flashed in his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I don&#39;t want trouble-I just want a comfortable life. Five hundred thousand a month should do iit,&#34;she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s stare turned icy before a slow, unsettling smile spread across his face. &#34;Fine. It&#39;s only right I take care of my aunt in her old age.&#34; Pleased with his response, Elyse gave a nod and walked off with the check in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winslow&#39;s gaze followed Elyse as she walked away,the lethal glint in his eyes intensifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Daniela had been feeling more exhausted than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she woke up, it was already past ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around this time, she typically stayed home in the morning, had lunch, took a short nap, and then headed to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian often teased that Daniela was practically in hibernation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela woke up to an eerily quiet house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The usual sight of Lillian gaming in the living room was missing; only Josie was bustling in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela grabbed a glass of water while Josie approached with a plate of fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric mentioned he had a cross-border meeting this morning but will be back in time for lunch. Nína got a call this morning, and Lillian went with her.They rushed out without breakfast, but Nina said she&#39;d return for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela nodded, then grabbed her phone to check for a response from the overseas university.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She planned to send Nina overseas for her studies.With everything that had unfolded, a change of environment and some new courses might help her reset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman needed the chance to explore the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela finished browsing the university details,the villa door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was the first to step in. &#34;Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela barely had time to react before Lillian dropped the bombshell. &#34;Elyse died.&#34;</p>
