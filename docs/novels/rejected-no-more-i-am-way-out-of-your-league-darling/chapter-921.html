                <p>Josh passed out the moment he heard it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he came to, his voice was weak and shaky.&#34;1just had the worst dream. I dreamed McCoy Group&#39;s stocks crashed, and it jolted me awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after Josh spoke, he glanced around and realized the room had fallen deathly quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone nudged a new secretary forward. The young man swallowed hard and spoke up. &#34;Mr.McCoy,this isn&#39;t a nightmare. It&#39;s real. The stock hit rock bottom this morning, and the losses are massive. Every news outlet is buzzing about McCoy Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be exact, every headline mocked the poor leadership at the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s hands trembled as he unlocked his phone.  The flood of comments under each article hit him like punches to the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can&#39;t stop laughing. Josh McCoy? Some talent he is! Just a few days in charge and he&#39;s ruined everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard half the executives quit before. Now another half walked out this morning. If it keeps up, will everyone Hamilton trained get pushed out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter if they quit or not. What matters is Josh can&#39;t run this place. If he won&#39;t step down, he&#39;s dragging the whole company down with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is the board asleep? How can they let this clown stay in charge? Do they want McCoy Group to hit rock bottom for good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard he fainted. Must&#39;ve been pure fear.If he keeps clinging to that chair, fainting will be the least of his problems soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under each story, the comments piled up by the millions, all tearing Josh apart. Josh&#39;s fists clenched so tight his knuckles went white. His eyes burned with a cold, savage fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad cleared his throat. &#34;Josh, what&#39;s the plan now?McCoy Group&#39;s bleeding money. Someone has to own up to this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules&#39; face looked stern. &#34;Since this company was founded, we&#39;ve never seen losses like this. We&#39;re a laughingstock now. Josh, tell us-how do you plan to fix it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan jumped in right away. &#34;I said it before. We need Hamilton back. You know how steady he is when it comes to handling crises. Look at Daniela. She&#39;s pressing us so hard it feels like she wants to wipe McCoy Group off the map.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh stiffened and snapped back, &#34;I barely stepped into this role. I&#39;m still getting the hang of things. You all need to be patient. Besides, don&#39;t act broke now.It&#39;s just a small dip in money. Is it worth turning your backs on me over this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while ago, nobody would have dared to challenge his words. But now, times were different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad narrowed his eyes. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean, Josh? You plan to cling to power no matter what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jules didn&#39;t hold back either. &#34;If you don&#39;t step aside soon, forget Daniela destroying us-these stock crashes will do the job for her. Stopo playing games.Sitting on that chair like a king-are you that hooked on it? This isn&#39;t your money to burn through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan added fuel to the fire. &#34;Right! Josh, you call this small? Ask finance for the numbers. We&#39;ve lost over ten billion just these past days. You trying to flush all the money Hamilton built up down the drain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rose until he was almost shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when the profits rolled in, everyone acted like one big, loyal family. Now that the cash flow turned to dust, the true colors showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s mouth hung open. &#34;What are you saying? You&#39;re putting this alI on me now? Weren&#39;t you the same people claiming Hamilton ruled too long and that McCoy Group could survive without him? And didn&#39;t you argue that the heir shouldn&#39;t just come from Hamilton&#39;s side, that any McCoy could lead?Now that everything&#39;s a mess, you pin it all on me? ls that it?&#34;</p>
