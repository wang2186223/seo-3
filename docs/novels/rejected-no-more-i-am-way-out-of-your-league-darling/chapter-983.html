                <p>Josh never settled for less; greed shimmered in his eyes as he planted himself at the gates of McCoy Group,brandishing a megaphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen up-this is the kind of shot at wealth that only comes once in a lifetime! Have you ever been crushed by poverty? Have you ever tasted humiliation just because your pockets were empty? Did you ever lose someone precious, all because you couldn&#39;t scrape together enough cash? Have you had to swallow your pride and dignity just to survive? Then come find me!I&#39;m giving you a shot to rewrite your story. You&#39;ve all heard how the McCoy family sits on a mountain of money,haven&#39;t you? Maybe you&#39;ve looked at my kids and thought, &#39;They were born lucky, born rich.&#39; Well,here&#39;s your moment. Take a risk-invest today, and maybe you&#39;ll be the one everyone envies next. Maybe you&#39;ll be the next to touch the heights of fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His speech blazed with charisma, words sharp as hooks.The crowd swelled, eyes gleaming with hope and greed, hanging on every syllable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the McCoy brothers finally pushed through the throng, the registration desk was already mobbed-hundreds scrambling to throw their money into Josh&#39;s promised dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan eyed Josh warily, unconvinced by his grand promises and slick talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Brad practically buzzed with excitement,his eagerness impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Josh paused to take a drink, Brad sidled up, his tone unusually warm.&#34;Josh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh barely spared him a glance, his lips curling into a smirk. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more condescending Josh was, the more convinced Brad was that this was the real deal.He let out a low chuckle. &#34;If there&#39;s money to be made,don&#39;t forget your brothers. Let&#39;s keep it in the family,yeah? No reason to let outsiders cash in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot a cold, fleeting look at Hamilton and Ethan,then huffed, &#34;Didn&#39;t you all used to trail after Daniela for every penny you made? What changed? You bored of her already? She stop impressing you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s expression soured, a sharp crease cutting across his forehead. &#34;We&#39;re here to talk business, not drag my daughter-in-law into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh leaned back, a mocking glint in his eyes. &#34;Touchy,are we? Since when are you so chummy with Daniela?Weren&#39;t you always the first to put her down? Now you&#39;re acting like her knight in shining armor. If you&#39;re so determined to defend her, what are you doing here with us? Go make a fortune with her instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s temper flared at once. &#34;She&#39;s my daughter -in-law. Naturally,I&#39;ll defend her. Forget it-it&#39;s just a lousy investment. I&#39;m out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun on his heel, ready to storm off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad caught his arm, forcing a conciliatory smile.&#34;Come on, Hamilton, don&#39;t be like that. We&#39;re all family. No need to get worked up-let&#39;s just talk investments, not Daniela. Josh, enough with the digs.Tell us about this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh downed the rest of his water in one go,lips curling into a confident grin. He launched into a vivid pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This project&#39;s massive. If it wasn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t be sharing the chance to make a killing. People are already crowding to register. Honestly, you might&#39;ve shown up too late. No promises you&#39;ll even snag a spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes widened in alarm. &#34;Wait, that&#39;s not fair!How can you leave your brothers out of a golden opportunity? Make a call-get us on the list.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot him a smug look. &#34;Are you all in,then?&#34; Brad nodded emphatically. &#34;Absolutely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh shot Ethan a sharp look, catching the flicker of interest in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Ethan&#39;s uncertainty, Josh curled his lip in disdain. &#34;Don&#39;t even count Ethan in-he&#39;ll just whine later and accuse me of scamming him. What about you,Hamilton? Are you in or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, still simmering over Josh&#39;s earlier digs at Daniela,bristled with silent resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Protectiveness radiated from him, every muscle tensed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Josh&#39;s prodding, he snapped, his voice flat, &#34;No.Not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh groaned and rolled his eyes theatrically.&#34;Unbelievable! You&#39;re really that sensitive? All because I brought up Daniela a few times? Seriously? What is she, a saint no one&#39;s allowed to mention? Come on.She&#39;s just pregnant with twins-it&#39;s not some kind of miracle. For all you know, those babies could be girls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad tugged insistently at Josh&#39;s sleeve, his voice low but certain. &#34;You&#39;ve got it wrong, Josh. The doctor already confirmed-Daniela&#39;s having twin boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s face went rigid, the news landing like a punch to the gut. &#34;What did you say? The doctor told you that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad nodded with a grin. &#34;Yeah. They checked a few days ago. She&#39;s carrying two boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh threw a sharp look at Hamilton, who merely lifted his chin with smug satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of envy burned through Josh&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all these years without a single boy, the McCoy family was suddenly getting two at once, and Hamilton, of all people, would be the one to claim the glory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bitter ache, he saw that comparison had crushed the spirit of joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cut the small talk. Are you investing or not?&#34;Annoyance colored Josh&#39;s voice as he glared at his brothers. &#34;If you&#39;re just here to chat, don&#39;t waste my time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stepped in, his tone placating. &#34;Alright, alright, no need to blow up. I&#39;ll invest-and Ethan&#39;s in too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at Hamilton, he went on, &#34;Hamilton, you realize what&#39;s on your shoulders now, don&#39;t you? Two grandsons on the way-nothing but the best will do.The whole family is counting on you. Even with Daniela running the show, if you don&#39;t step up, aren&#39;t you going to feel a little embarrassed? Imagine facing Daniela if you fall short. Think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton mulled over Brad&#39;s words, caught between pride and pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad broke the tension with a brisk laughn. &#34;Come on,what&#39;s there to think about? Josh, count Hamilton in -he&#39;s investing,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh grinned, clearly amused by how easily things had fallen into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lounging back,he radiated smug self-assurance.&#34;Fine,but let&#39;s get something straight-don&#39;t bother showing up with pocket change. The buy-in starts here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a number with his fingers, leaving no room for negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared at him, stunned. &#34;That much? Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh folded his arms, eyes glinting. &#34;Look, I told you -this is as close to a sure thing as it gets. There&#39;s a line of people waiting to get in. If you&#39;re not investing real money,why even bother? How much do you think you&#39;ll make with scraps? I spelled it all out in the plan:give it a month, and you&#39;ll double your money.You&#39;ll have enough to spoil every grandkid rotten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s brow furrowed in doubt. &#34;Just one month?&#34; Josh nodded, his tone turning almost patronizing.&#34;Absolutely. You&#39;ve seen the numbers. This project is rock-solid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton studied the documents again, searching for any hidden pitfalls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as far as he could tell, everything checked out-a mining venture, massive profits on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, something in his gut wouldn&#39;t settle, even as Logic left him with no grounds to object.</p>
