                <p>Alexander lingered in the courtyard for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only Joyce&#39;s voice, calling his name, that snapped him out of his reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time had slipped by unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been a vault when it came to the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Cedric hadn&#39;t unearthed those details today, Alexander could have continued to believe all those triumphs were his own craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that revelation, Alexander recognized that he had been the primary beneficiary throughout their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, he had deluded himself into thinking that Daniela had married into the Bennett family out of avarice, using their wealth and influence as stepping stones to cement her status within the Harper family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,reflecting on those thoughts, he realized how naïve and absurd they had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after their separation, Daniela had kept her silence about her contributions. Was she protecting his fragile ego?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization stirred a maelstrom of shame, regret, and vexation within Alexander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it dawned on him-when Bennett Group teetered on the brink of another crisis post-divorce,and he found himself floundering for solutions, it was because Daniela was no longer his hidden ace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disoriented, Alexander shuffled bagk into the villa. As he passed through the living room, Joyce&#39;s voice echoed a few times, but it fell on deaf ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian questioned Daniela, &#34;What&#39;s gotten into Alexander?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander deliberately slowed his steps,straining to hear Daniela&#39;s reply. Yet, there was only silence.When he turned back, he saw Daniela seated serenely on the sofa, engrossed in her game, utterly aloof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Alexander understood. Daniela had completely severed ties with him-just as she had with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric, who had never been daunted by anything, now stood frozen in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered silently in front of Daniela&#39;s door, paralyzed. Words failed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divide between them wasn&#39;t merely physical-it felt as though he had been relegated to the outskirts of her universe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite living under the same roof and crossing paths daily, an invisible barrier seemed to isolate him from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During this period, Cedric left on a two-day business trip and found himself embroiled in a trivial yet annoying scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an unfounded rumor-utter drivel. Normally, Cedric would have shrugged off such nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, he panicked. He dialed his team, demanding they quash the trending topic at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon his return to the villa, Cedric was slightly breathless from hastening back. In the living room, Caiden waved his phone, making snide remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric&#39;s still quite the heartthrob. Even in a meeting, he sparks a romance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Cedric&#39;s got the looks, the clout, and the cash. Who in Olisvine even comes close? And check this out-he&#39;s practically glued to that actress in this picture!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;ve seen her! She&#39;s starring in that buzzed-about drama. It&#39;s no surprise she&#39;s climbed the ranks so quickly with these kinds of connections. Guess Cedric&#39;s her benefactor, huh?&#34; Katrina chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joyce looked up at Cedric, who had just entered, and blurted out,&#34;Cedric, is it true? Are you really that actress&#39;s benefactor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent, the question hanging in the air like a storm cloud. All eyes turned to Cedric, all except Daniela&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood still, his gaze lingering on Daniela as he eventually muttered, &#34;I can explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does that mean?&#34; Caiden jumped in, eager to fan the flames.′′SO1you&#39;re his sugar daddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander glanced briefly at Cedric, then redirected his gaze to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained composed, her focus glued to her phone. She continued playing the beta version of the game, occasionally issuing debugging instructions into her headset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric set down his luggage and stepped towards Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could speak, Daniela stood and turned to Lillian and Ryan.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Cedric notice the luggage near the door. His confusion intensified. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t reply. She brushed past him, phone in hand, answering a call as she approached the door.&#34;Yes, I understand. I&#39;m heading out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian and Ryan lifted the luggage and followed her. Outside, the sound of an airplane engine revving up filled the air, the rumble resembling thunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clutched Cedric&#39;s heart. He sensed that if he didn&#39;t clarify things now, he could lose her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried after Daniela, desperate to join her on the plane. But she halted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She removed her earbuds, facing him. &#34;I have to go abroad for work. It&#39;s not convenient for you to come.Besides, you wouldn&#39;t be comfortable staying here alone while we&#39;re away. Just return to your own home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes reddened instantly, his voice cracking as he pleaded, &#34;You&#39;re not letting me come with you anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile, her expression gentle yet distant.&#34;Why would you want to come with me,Cedric? You have your own company, and I have my responsibilities. You were never obligated to stay by my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s not it!&#34; Cedric&#39;s voice was frantic, his composure shattered. He was overwhelmed, his words tumbling out in a desperate scramble. &#34;There&#39;s no scandal. That actress is my cousin-I&#39;m not backing anyone! And the money I transferred to Caiden-I didn&#39;t mean to deceive you. I just didn&#39;t want you to be hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a shaky breath, struggling to articulate his plea. &#34;Daniela, I&#39;ll heed your advice from now on. I swear -this is the first and last time. I&#39;ll never keep anything from you again.&#34; In a last-ditch effort, Cedric reached out and clutched the hem of Daniela&#39;s coat, his hands trembling.&#34;Please don&#39;t leave me.&#34;</p>
