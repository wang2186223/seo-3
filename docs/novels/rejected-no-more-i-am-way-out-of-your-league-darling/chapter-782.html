                <p>Cedric was going over the last of the design notes when he noticed someone slipping past quietly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and saw a man-no work uniform, no badge He frowned and asked, &#34;Who are you? I haven&#39;t seen you before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up ahead, the delivery manager quickly turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smooth smile, he stepped forward. &#34;Mr.Phillips,we&#39;re here with the food delivery. Everything&#39;s packed and ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Daniela&#39;s company had its own cafeteria,employees sometimes preferred meals from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric gave a small nod and started to turn back to the plans. But something made him pause. &#34;Where&#39;s the food from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man froze for half a breath, then smiled again &#34;The restaurant division from the Lindsay family&#39;s hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric reached out his hand. &#34;Let me see the receipt.&#34;That smile faltered. His fingers twitched. &#34;Of course!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Are you treating everyone today, Mr. Phillips? I&#39;ll make sure they all know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he talked, he glanced quickly at the rest of the delivery crew</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They got the signal and rushed toward the elevators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric signed the form and told him to settle the bill with accounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he returned to his work,face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,Daniela stood near the door,half-listening to Nikolas&#39;s meaningless chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned her head, the delivery team had already vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied Nikolas&#39; smug look, and in that instant,everything clicked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,just consider what I said,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was already walking away,ignoring Nikolas&#39; words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes followed her as she entered the building.&#34;Let&#39;s see you explain your way out of this one,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela took the stairs in quick strides. As she passed the design floor, a worker nudged his colleague. &#34;Didn&#39;t Cedric just go upstairs? Why is Daniela heading that way too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other shrugged</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the top floor, the delivery men were gone, and close to two hundred meal boxes sat untouched on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Cedric was still giving instructions to the crew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped out and saw her. &#34;I took care of it. The food&#39;s tainted. They dumped it and ran. I&#39;ll have our cafeteria make extra today. We&#39;re cutting off outside orders for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked pale. The stress of nonstop design work showed in the circles beneath his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still catching his breath from running up earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s hands curled at her sides. She swallowed the anger rising in her throat.&#34;Okay. Go rest. I&#39;ll handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric nodded but didn&#39;t head out. Instead, he turned and went back downstairs to meet with the design team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela knew he only ever wanted to be useful to her She clenched her fists, staring down at the pile of boxed meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol walked up, unimpressed. &#34;Nikolas really doesn&#39;t know when to quit, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;If he wants to be reckless,let him. But he won&#39;t like how this ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same day, rumors spread like wildfire. A food poisoning outbreak linked to McCoy Group&#39;s restaurant division had just gone public. Within hours,it was everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, is this actually happening? How could McCoy Group mess up this badly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Daniela reserved the biggest hospital in Oiscoll just to treat her staff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too. They said people were throwing up blood Others couldn&#39;t even make it to treatment without getting sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is unreal. Honestly? It&#39;s scary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember when Hamilton himself landed in the hospital from food poisoning? If it could happen to him,then anyone&#39;s fair game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The story,once buried deep, came roaring back. At McCoy Group headquarters, Hamilton was losing control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went straight for the food service manager. &#34;Did I not suspend Nikolas? WVho gave him clearance to do anything? And you thought it was smart to send a whole delivery team? Did you really think Cedric and Daniela wouldn&#39;t figure it out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice grew louder. &#34;And the worst part? You used our own form and claimed it came from the Lindsay family&#39;s hotel. You just gave Daniela solid evidence.And now the Lindsay family is pissed off too. What were you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager didn&#39;t get a second chance. Hamilton fired him on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Nikolas. &#34;How could you be this foolish? We&#39;re backed into a corner. Now what?What&#39;s your master plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stayed silent. He hadn&#39;t expected Daniela and Cedric to respond this quickly-or this sharply</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes hardened. &#34;So my words mean nothing now? Fine. If you&#39;re so eager to crash this empire, go ahead. But starting today, every title you hold in McCoy Group is gone. Let&#39;s see how far you get without them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stumbled out of the room in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, Hamilton&#39;s secretary rushed to catch up.&#34;Sir, don&#39;t take it personally Your father had to make a move. It&#39;s all for show-to calm the public. He didn&#39;t mean all of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nikolas wasn&#39;t listening anymore</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked back at the closed office doors,his face heavy with defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In his eyes, I&#39;m good-for-nothing,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same afternoon, Nikolas stood before cameras and issued a public apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And while the press tried to make sense of it all,Daniela&#39;s company dropped another blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of their employees had slipped into a coma-because of that food.</p>
