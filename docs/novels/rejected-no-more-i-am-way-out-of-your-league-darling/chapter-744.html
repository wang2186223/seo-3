                <p>At that moment, Daniela was momentarily speechless.She could only stare at Cedric in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric met Daniela&#39;s look and spoke up. &#34;I overheard your conversation with Charles just now. Since you&#39;re willing to give me everything you have, then why can&#39;t I do something for you in return? Trust me,Daniela. I won&#39;t let what happened three years ago repeat itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s expression turned into a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Persisting, Cedric suggested, &#34;I have no intentions of returning home. Why not let me contribute? Wouldn&#39;t we do better as a team?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, Daniela replied, &#34;This place is fraught with danger. You don&#39;t uinderstand the real nature of Hamilton. No one ascends to his position without being ambitious and ruthless. Hamilton is definitely not as friendly as he seemed today. And this is his turf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric dismissed her concerns. &#34;And? You&#39;ll keep me safe,won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was left speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric suggested, &#34;Just give me a week. If it doesn&#39;t work, you can send me away immediately, no complaints from me. Agreed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could respond, Cedric added,&#34;I swear, I&#39;ll just wait for you at home. But if you refuse and force me to go back home, I&#39;ll just fly myself right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela frowned once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric glanced at Carol, silently pleading for her support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol, recalling Ryan&#39;s and Lillian&#39;s, words, stepped forward. &#34;We&#39;re stuck in this storm for a few more days. Let him try. What&#39;s the worst that could happen? He might lose another leg, but as long as he&#39;s alive, it&#39;s fine. Right,Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric knew Carol was speaking up for him, but he felt something wrong. With no time to ponder,he nodded. &#34;Yes, I&#39;ll survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling defeated, Daniela didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric smmiled broadly and grabbed Daniela&#39;s hand.&#34;So,we&#39;re agreed then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton had mentioned a dinner invitation in a few days, but surprisingly, he called that very evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the phone, his tone was much warmer than his earlier demeanor at the villa. &#34;We&#39;ve just received a fresh deep-sea catch perfect for sashimi. Why don&#39;t you and Cedric join us for a delightful meal? It&#39;s just a casual family gathering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He assured her that only a few people would be present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela and Cedric arrived, they quickly realized the full extent of what Hamilton meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was enormous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their home had turned into a lively party scene. The venue buzzed with over a hundred guests,creating an intense atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol glanced around at the attendees and remarked to Daniela, &#34;Seems like Hamilton is trying to assert his dominance, huh? Your father-in-law doesn&#39;t pay nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela observed the crowd and responded coolly,&#34;If he thinks this display will cow me, he&#39;s mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Hamilton was attempting to manipulate her psychologically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the second-floor balcony of the villa, Hamilton watched the gathering with a detached expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary approached quietly. &#34;Mr. McCoy,Daniela and Cedric are here. Should I escort them up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton responded leisurely, &#34;Let&#39;s not hurry.Daniela has a strong sense of pride. We need to make her understand her place here. Also, we can&#39;t allow her to continue that investigation.&#34; The secretary reassured him, &#34;The evidence has been eliminated. Even someone as capable as Daniela won&#39;t uncover anything now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton merely nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, the secretary lowered his voice further. &#34;And regarding Cedric... how do you plan to handle his place in the family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton leaned back thoughtfully. &#34;Cedric&#39;s an illegitimate son of mine. While I do pity him, the family must always come first. If he proves loyal, I&#39;l reward him accordingly. But should he choose defiance, he will find no leniency from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary nodded, understanding the stakes involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In affluent circles like theirs, familial bonds often succumbed to the pursuits of power and strategic interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Hamilton did hold some affection for Cedric, it was limited. Hamilton was not particularly eager to forge a closer bond with Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His primary focus remained on Daniela, who stood behind Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton raised his glass, his gaze cold and calculating as he looked at Daniela next to Cedric. &#34;If you prove useful, that&#39;s perfect. If not, you might just vanish like your mother did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Below, Daniela seemed to feel the weight of his stare and slowly lifted her eyes to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She acknowledged him with a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smile widened, his expression one of gracious tolerance.</p>
