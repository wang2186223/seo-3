                <p>Caiden&#39;s irritation simmered just beneath the surface, growing with each step Daniela took away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain his frustration, he bellowed, &#34;You think you can just cut ties with me? I&#39;ll make damn sure that doesn&#39;t happen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had turned from a nondescript girl to a golden goose. Severing ties with her was unthinkable, an option only conceivable if he were six feet under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina jumped to her feet, worried Caiden would act on impulse and actually cut ties with Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re absolutely right, Caiden! She doesn&#39;t get to walk away from us like we&#39;re nothing! She&#39;s stuck being your daughter, and that means when we&#39;re old,she has to take care of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing up with fiery determination, Joyce exclaimed, &#34;Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhearing the conversation, Cedric balled his hands into fists, the knuckles whitening as he struggled to restrain his mounting anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jerry, who had been quietly observing the chaos, rolled his eyes in exasperation.He moved briskly towards the door, locking it with a definitive,echoing click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, noticing his actions, seized his arm urgently.&#34;What the hell are you doing locking that? We&#39;re not done here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry paused, taking a deep breath as he fought to maintain his calm. &#34;Are you serious? Do you even grasp the gravity of your actions? You slapped Ms.Harper in her own building! And yet, you dare to ask about running a shop? Can you even hear yourself talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression contorted with rage, and for a fleeting second, it seemed like he was ready to break someone&#39;s jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry&#39;s devotion to Daniela was unwavering. During his family&#39;s darkest times, Daniela had been his beacon of support, and he vowed to remain indebted to her forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing someone as kind-hearted as Daniela endure a public humiliation at the hands of her own father was more than he could bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jerry&#39;s rage simmered beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The issue wasn&#39;t that the elderly were deteriorating into malevolence. Rather, it was the wicked who aged without mending their ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething with anger, Jerry marched away from the scene. Joyce remained rooted to the spot, her gaze fixed on the locked door of the shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being tucked away in the basement, the space was far superior to any other she could have dreamt of securing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce pulled at her mother&#39;s sleeve and murmured,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, maybe this place isn&#39;t all that bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, still visibly distraught and mortified by the day&#39;s events, felt a pang of bitterness towards Caiden. She had never imagined he would lose his composure and strike Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was supposed to act, he held back. And when it was better to stay quiet, he ran his mouth like an idiot and ruined it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words slipped from her lips before she realized it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden whirled around, his expression a mix of shock and disbelief. &#34;What did you just say? After all this mess, you&#39;re pointing the finger at me? Do you even get who I was risking everything for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned around and stormed away, not once glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina, jolted back to reality by her own blunder,stood frozen, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. Beside her, Joyce shifted uncomfortably, her eyes darting between the closed shop door and Caiden&#39;s receding figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of her lost virginity flooded back, and she suddenly burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news that the CEO of Elite Luix had been publicly humiliated was rapidly spreading across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Alexander exited the meeting, the scandal&#39;s details began to unravel before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed the contract down on the table with a resounding thud and dialed Katrina&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone barely rang before she answered, her voice laced with accusation. &#34;Alexander! How could you let this happen? You never mentioned that Daniela&#39;s offer was just for the basement spot! Now look at the mess you&#39;ve caused. Caiden actually hit Daniela, right there in front of everyone, and now she&#39;s refusing to let us lease any space at all. What are we supposed to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander opened his mouth to protest, but Katrina crushed his attempt, her words slicing through him like a blade. &#34;I don&#39;t give a damn how you fix it,but you better clean up this disaster for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned into silence, Alexander could only listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Katrina ended the call than Joyce&#39;s name flashed on his screen. Her voice, shaky and tear-streaked, filled his ear. &#34;Alexander, please,you have to convince Daniela to reconsider. I&#39;ll take the basement if that&#39;s what it takes. Just make sure everything is crystal clear next time, okay? My dad&#39;s absolutely furious. Just fix this and let me know when it&#39;s done. I really have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she disconnected the call, leaving Alexander grappling with the chaos that unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shut his eyes, his chilling presence sending shivers down his secretary&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, his phone buzzed-a call from Richard. &#34;I&#39;ve heard Daniela has been in close contact with Clayton Renovation recently. Take advantage of her recent ordeal with that slap to dig for information. We can&#39;t afford to let this lucrative opportunity slip through our fingers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project was worth billions, and Richard&#39;s concern was palpable, especially since Daniela&#39;s team had yet to reach out to Bennett Group for a collaboration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should invite Daniela over for dinner,&#34; Richard urged, convinced they needed to act rather than wait passively. &#34;She&#39;s a young woman, and after today&#39;s events, she&#39;s undoubtedly shaken. A comforting visit from you, a few compassionate words-she might just be moved. And with the residual affection she harbors for you, who knows? Sparks might fly again.Alexander, stop messing around and get serious about it. Let&#39;s arrange a family dinner tonight. I&#39;ve had my disagreements with Daniela, but this evening is an ideal moment to mend fences. Whether it&#39;s forging a business alliance or considering a union,both parties stand to gain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s words were so meticulously/ crafted that even Alexander&#39;s secretary sensed the deliberate nature of his manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call was disconnected, the secretary turned to Alexander. &#34;This time, it might be harder than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander shot a dismissive glance at his secretary and responded with a cold snort, &#34;Perhaps for others, but not when Daniela is involved.I know I can handle her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Richard&#39;s ongoing disputes with Daniela were hardly a secret. He had previously belittled her, consistently ridiculing her capabilities and dismissing her as inconsequential with his sharp, disdainful comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Richard&#39;s current strategy involved winning her over with displays of warmth and apparent sincerity. Daniela had always yearned for the familial bonds and affection that had eluded her during her upbringing, and Richard&#39;s wvell-rehearsed charm and courteous demeanor were likely to thaw her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to his secretary, Alexander commanded, &#34;Fetch the navy-blue suit from my wardrobe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Daniela&#39;s favorite suit on him, yet he had deliberately shunned wearing it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Likely, it had been neglected and gathering dust in his closet for some time now.</p>
