                <p>&#34;I might not have money, but I wasn&#39;t built for struggle. If your plans don&#39;t include me, then I&#39;ve got no choice but to look after myself. Isn&#39;t that fair?&#34;Caiden&#39;s voice turned sharp. &#34;You&#39;re cold, Daniela.Always calculating. Can you really fault me for taking care of myself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved a hand toward the shelves. &#34;And let&#39;s be honest. You can&#39;t have kids anymore. What&#39;s the point of keeping all that stuff your mother saved? The toys she bought for your future child-who&#39;s going to use them now? I might as well sell them and live a better life. What&#39;s the harm in that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped closer, his tone rising. &#34;I was meant for luxury. I&#39;m your father. You&#39;re supposed to take care of me! Your mother made sure I lived well. You should do the same. I&#39;m all you&#39;ve got. There&#39;s no one else.Just me. In this world, I&#39;m your only family. So, no matter what I do, you owe me. You hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t flinch. Her eyes stayed fixed on the television screen. Without looking his way, she said,&#34;Is that what you believe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one sentence wiped the smile off his face. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? You&#39;d better think hard before you act. I&#39;m your father. I&#39;m the closest person you&#39;ve got. Are you really planning to turn on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the front door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new director from the asylum stepped in and greeted Daniela. &#34;Miss Harper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t even lift her eyes. &#34;Take my father with you. And this time, make sure he doesn&#39;t escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden blinked. His jaw went slack. Then came the scream.&#34;No! Daniela! You can&#39;t do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was already in motion. He was dragged through the hall, yelling so loud it shook the walls. The villa erupted in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce froze where she stood. Her lips parted, but no sound came. She watched, too stunned to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas came down the stairs, confused. &#34;What happened just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still watching the screen, Daniela spoke in a clipped voice. &#34;He&#39;s lost his mind. He claimed he was my only family. So I did what anyone would do-l made sure he&#39;s looked after.&#34; She pushed herself off thne couch and walked to the kitchen without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stood at the doorway, eyes following the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the open door, he saw Caiden being forced into a van, a cloth shoved in his mouth,arms bound tightly. The door slammed shut. The van sped off. His screams faded into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce sank to the floor, completely overwhelmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela didn&#39;t react. She picked up her bowl and spooned oatmeal into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas watched her, a heavy feeling settling in his chest. She had sent her own father away, and she hadn&#39;t blinked once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. McCoy, would you like something to eat?&#34;Daniela asked, her tone even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked toward the doorway, still trying to understand what he&#39;d just seen. &#34;You don&#39;t get along with your family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without lifting her head, Daniela answered, &#34;I don&#39;t have any family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas asked, &#34;What about Cedric?&#34; Right then, Cedric stepped out of the room. He stopped in place when he caught the end of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small laugh. Nikolas glanced at her.watching closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she said in an easy tone, &#34;Mr. McCoy, ever heard this one before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas tilted his head.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned, her stare sharp enough to pierce.&#34;Curiosity killed the cat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t get a chance to respond before she added,&#34;Same way those mercenaries ended up scattered that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stiffened. The change in his face was immediate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes darkened, fixed on her with an unfamiliar chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavysilence fell over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nikolas opened his mouth to say something,Tasha cut in. &#34;Mr. Phillips? What would you like for breakfast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela kept her eyes down and continued eating  without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, his focus drifting. Then he quietly joined her at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric stood to the side, watching both of them. He was certain if Tasha hadn&#39;t spoken when she did,Nikolas would&#39;ve said whatever was brewing in his head.But in the end, Nikolas said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Daniela went upstairs without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas stepped out onto the porch to take a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Cedric dead yet?&#34; the voice asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; he answered flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Do you want us to help you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought you hired people to kill Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas said nothing right away. His eyes wandered to a room on the second floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, with her remarkable insight, was definitely not as simple as she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might become his biggest obstacle in dealing with Cedric.</p>
