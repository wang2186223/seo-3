                <p>Kohen glanced at Daniela, and in that instant, he realized why both Nikolas and Damon were drawn to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She possessed a rare magnetism that made her stand out effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he not been a McCoy, he might have been swayed by the unexpected trust she showed him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But sadly, he bore the McCoy name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with it came his ambition to seize the family legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His goal was to find out Daniela&#39;s weaknesses and tell his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,Daniela. I&#39;ll give it my best,&#34; he promised</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a curt nod. &#34;You may go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Kohen left, Carol stepped into the room.&#34;Why would he pick construction and engineering? It means working outside no matter the weather, and it&#39;s seriously tiring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a dry, ironic smirk. Carol was briefly confused,then it dawned on her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen returned, blueprint in hand, and knocked on her door. &#34;Daniela, there are flaws in this layout. Look here-and here. These sections are problematic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave it a quick look. &#34;Design issues should go to the department manager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen cast his gaze downward, a hint of vulnerability in his demeanor. &#34;It wouldn&#39;t be right for me to criticize the manager&#39;s work so soon after joining,and I&#39;m not completely sure myself. Would you mind coming with me to the site for a brief look? Your questions would carry more weight than mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he said that, Carol instantly realized-Kohen was testing if Daniela was afraid of heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol&#39;s eyes lit with fury, her fist tightening at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela stayed composed. &#34;I&#39;m not going. The manager will join you shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen pressed on, &#34;But this section&#39;s vital. And the site is near the villa. A quick check tomorrow morning would take fifteen minutes at most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela laid her pen aside and leaned back slightly &#34;You seem very enthusiastic about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen answered, &#34;Certainly, it&#39;s a crucial section of  the project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela fixed her gaze on Kohen silently for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s eyes shifted nervously under her steady stare</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled. &#34;Really? Since it&#39;s so vital, I&#39;ll accompany you to inspect it tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Perfect! Then after breakfast tomorrow, we&#39;ll go together &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Content,he turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening,Damon came back from the casino and heard from Carol that Kohen intended to bring Daniela to check the project the following day</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon skipped his meal and pulled Kohen aside from the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela and Cedric glanced up, noticing the two had already left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the villa, Damon confronted Kohen. &#34;This was deliberate, right? Using the project as bait to drag Daniela to the high-rise!&#34; Damon narrowed his eyes,aware Daniela wasn&#39;t truly afraid of heights but annoyed Kohen would misuse her trust for such a petty ploy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa featured expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. At night, people outside couldn&#39;t see in, but those inside had a clear view out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three at the table turned to watch the unfolding scene as if it were a live show</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon clenched his jaw. &#34;You&#39;re despicable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen shot back, &#34;I&#39;m doing this for the family! Unlike you,who&#39;s grown used to sitting idle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s rubbish!&#34; Damon snapped back. &#34;You&#39;re only exploiting Nikolas&#39; absence, hoping to claim the inheritance. Mark my words, your devious plans will never succeed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen sneered, &#34;Oh really? But your idol has already agreed to inspect the project with me tomorrow. If she&#39;s scared to climb, it proves she truly fears heights If she goes up, then it means you lied to Father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s tone sharpened as he faced Damon.&#34;You aided an outsider in fooling Father. You know what that means! But if Daniela&#39;s acrophobia is real, then we have uncovered her weakness, and you can take credit for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon gritted his teeth. &#34;You&#39;re revolting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re from the McCoy family,&#34; Kohen snapped.&#34;Don&#39;t let Daniela&#39;s petty favors fool you. She handed you a failing casino, and now you&#39;re acting like a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sycophant.How pathetic!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric and Daniela stood inside, watching Damon&#39;s face flush with rage, powerless to stop Kohen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol couldn&#39;t hold back, pleading, &#34;Daniela, say something! Damon&#39;s being bullied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela glanced at Carol. &#34;If you&#39;re so bothered, why don&#39;t you step in? He&#39;s your buddy, not mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol admitted, &#34;I&#39;m not good at arguing. If I jump in,we&#39;ll both be humiliated. That&#39;s even worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen,seasoned in the MAcCoy family politics,wielded his words like weapons. Carol had tried to argue but never got the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot a helpless look at Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela set down her fork and stepped toward the villa door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warm light poured out from inside, illuminating the ground outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela peered out, seeing Kohen&#39;s smug grin and Damon&#39;s furious, reddened eyes trembling with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Daniela, Damon swallowed hard, fighting back tears he refused to show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela leaned on the doorframe, her gaze steady &#34;What were you two discussing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen opened his mouth to answer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Daniela turned to Damon instead. &#34;I&#39;m asking you.Why are you quiet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon sniffed,his voice firm. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela faced Kohen sharply. &#34;There&#39;s no bullying in my home. You can either come inside and eat or get out.Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her back on him without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped inside, she glanced at Damon. &#34;Aren&#39;t you coming in? Do I have to ask you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference was obvious-Kohen was told to leave;Damon was invited in. The favoritism was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damon eagerly stepped inside after her, while Kohen lingered outside, humiliated and fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kohen&#39;s fist tightened at his side, his eyes flashing with anger and spite in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seethed silently, vowing to deal with Daniela tomorrow.</p>
