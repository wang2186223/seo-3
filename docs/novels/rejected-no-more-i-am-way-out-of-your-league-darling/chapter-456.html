                <p>For a brief moment, the drama took center stage, with gossip swirling around the room, completely overshadowing the auction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Joyce? Daniela&#39;s stepsister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s quite the piece of work. First, she took Alexander from Daniela, and now, Cedric. Seems like Joyce&#39;s plan is to steal men right from under Daniela&#39;s nose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sure looks that way. But wasn&#39;t Cedric always indifferent to other women before? Why is he suddenly so close to Joyce, right in front of Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a mess...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers grew louder, one voice cutting through.&#34;Look,Daniela&#39;s standing up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, all eyes turned to the back row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer, visibly frustrated, watched as the drama unfolded. The crowd was too captivated to focus on the auction itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Daniela stood up, but Lillian quickly grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniolo claneed ouor her face hetraving no emotion Lillian glanced around at the curious looks and whispered, &#34;There are too many people here Confronting them now would be embarrassing. Why not wait and ask Cedric what&#39;s going on later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head and made her way to the front row. &#34;I need to see who that is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian followed,still confused. &#34;Huh? Isn&#39;t that Cedric?Who else would it be? Daniela, there are too many eyes on us today. Maybe you should think about Cedric&#39;s dignity. This could just be a misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela smiled at her	suggestion.	&#34;No misunderstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian was about to voice her surprise, Daniela continued, &#34;No. It&#39;s not him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gasped, but before she could say anything else.they saw &#34;Cedric&#34; suddenly stand up, fasten his suit,and walk off in a different direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela froze for a moment and scrutinized the man once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, his face was undeniably identical to Cedric&#39;s.as was his demeanor, from the way he buttoned his suit to his confident stride as he walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Daniela could inspect the man further,a sharp.taunting voice interrupted. &#34;Look who it is, my high-and-mighty stepsister.What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Invce sat in the front row,legs crossed,swinging then with a smug smile on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian frowned,her voice growing sharp. &#34;Who was that just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce couldn&#39;t help but feel pleased. With a sly smile she responded,&#34;Why? Are you getting nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s voice rang out, loud enough to draw the attention of everyone in theroom,even pausing the auctioneer mid-sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, the one who just walked out? That was Cedric Don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t even recognize your own husband,Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t hold back. &#34;What nonsense are you spewing? That wasn&#39;t Cedric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really that sure?&#34; Joyce patted her trousers as though wiping away invisible dust, wearing the same smug grin she&#39;d had when she sabotaged Daniela&#39;s wedding with Alexander. &#34;Sorry, Daniela, I didn&#39;t mean to. Blame Cedric for being too handsome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian rolled up her sleeves and stepped forward.delivering a sharp slap across Joyce&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s head snapped to the side, with blood trickling from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of the stunned crowd, she began to sob.&#34;Daniela, you couldn&#39;t hold on to your man, so why blame me? Cedric and I are in love. Please, let us be together.&#34; Without waming,Joyce dramatically dropped to her knees before Daniela,her act in full swing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately,the crowd pulled out their phones.eager to capture the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could take a photo, Daniela grabbed Joyce by the arm and shoved her backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers, craning their necks, could only catch a glimpse of Daniela&#39;s back as she disappeared behind the curtains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the audience dispersed. Joyce dropped her pretenses, a sneer curling on her lips. &#34;What,Daniela?Are you scared I&#39;ll ruin your husband&#39;s reputation? But Cedric&#39;s already cheated on you. Why are you still defending him? Why not step aside and let me have him? Just like you did with Alexander, walking away without a second thought. Be as tough and quick as you were with him, making those men who hurt you regret it. Daniela, didn&#39;t you always act so bold and decisive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce eyed Daniela, her phone hidden behind her back as she dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela noticed but didn&#39;t care in the slightest. &#34;That wasn&#39;t Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce paused for a beat, then burst into wild laughter.&#34;Daniela, I never imagined you&#39;d end up like this. You can&#39;t even face the truth. What&#39;s wrong? Have you really fallen for Cedric and can&#39;t bring yourself to let  him go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Daniela replied, standing firm under the harsh backstage lights. &#34;I can&#39;t bear it, but that man wasn&#39;t Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce crossed her arms, and a mocking smile played on her lips. &#34;What makes you so sure? Everyone saw it; even your little lackey noticed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Lillian rushed over and slapped Joyce once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce spat out a mix of blood and a tooth,glaring at Eillian with intense hatred. &#34;Daniela, no matter how much you have people beat me, it won&#39;t change the fact that the man just now was Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;You already know the truth.don&#39;t care what you&#39;re up to, but I suggest you stop.This tooth is your warning. Next time, it won&#39;t just be a tooth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Daniela gave Joyce a cold look and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she was out of sight,Joyce slammed her fist down onto the table in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call was still connected. Joyce grabbed the phone and spoke into it. &#34;Did you hear that, Alexander? Back then, Daniela had no problem moving on from you,but now with Cedric, she can&#39;t let go. Even though it&#39;s so obvious, she doesn&#39;t have the guts to admit it.If you were here, you&#39;d see the look on Daniela&#39;s face She doesn&#39;t love you; she only loves Cedric. So, the only way you&#39;ll stay close to her is if you&#39;re Cedric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, Alexander&#39;s voice was icy. &#34;I&#39;ll stay by Daniela&#39;s side for life, even if it means living as Cedric.&#34;</p>
