                <p>Hamilton waited for Josh to settle down before letting out a long breath, then said, &#34;Daniela&#39;s getting her payback.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh&#39;s anger reignited instantly. &#34;Of course she is! This is all about revenge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton continued, &#34;Daniela was just a child when you murdered her mother, leaving her to fend for herself.Now everything&#39;s fallen apart. If you want, I&#39;ll go to Daniela myself-I&#39;ll tell her that Mason losing his hands was the price paid for her mother&#39;s death. Maybe then we can finally let the past rest. What do you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Hamilton finished speaking, Josh&#39;s fury exploded. &#34;Are you out of your mìnd, Hamilton? You&#39;re Mason&#39;s uncle, someone my son should look up to! And this is what you come up with? Let the past go?Mason&#39;s still stuck in a hospital bed, and you&#39;re acting like it&#39;s ancient history?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Hamilton a cold glare before going on, &#34;Easy for you to say when it&#39;s not your kid lying there-no wonder you don&#39;t give a damn. So spare me the moral high ground, Hamilton. And don&#39;t talk to me about penance-using Mason&#39;s hands to pay for Brylee&#39;s life? She wasn&#39;t worth it, and neither is Daniela! Lisen to me-Brylee was never worth as much as Mason. Daniela or Cedric dare to hurt my son. I won&#39;t let it slide.Given Cedric&#39;s your son, I&#39;Il grant him a quick death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Josh snapped at his secretary, &#34;Get this man out of my sight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton exhaled quietly. &#34;You won&#39;t take my word for it, fine-handle things your way. But don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you. Daniela&#39;s not someone you want to mess with. She&#39;s survived this long for a reason. And if you don&#39;t resolve this, don&#39;t be surprised when McCoy Group faces the fallout.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hamilton ended her sentence, Patrick couldn&#39;t hold back a mocking laugh. &#34;Seriously, Hamilton? You&#39;re making this sound like the end of the world. We&#39;re talking about Daniela, not some criminal mastermind.Didn&#39;t you say she&#39;d pull something dramatic? Well, I haven&#39;t seen any disaster, and if anything, the stocks have been doing fine. Maybe it&#39;s time you stepped aside and let the younger generation handle things.We&#39;ll see to it that Mason gets justice. Nobody here plans on letting this slide.&#34; With Patrick&#39;s words, the rest of the family murmured their support, heads nodding in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, with a weary sigh, turned on his heel and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas walked into Daniela&#39;s villa to find Carol lounging with a popsicle in hand, the summer heat barely fazing her. He started venting as soon as he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My uncle and the others are losing their minds ove this. Maybe you could reach out to Daniela? Honestly,this has gone way past the line. Sure, Mason&#39;s mouth got him in trouble, but to lose both hands? The doctors say there&#39;s no saving them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol took her time, biting into her popsicle, and asked with a sly grin, &#34;Sounds like Cedric&#39;s not putting up with anything these days. So, what exactly did Mason say to set Daniela off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas didn&#39;t bother sugarcoating it. &#34;He said he wanted to sleep with her. Mason&#39;s always been a spoiled brat-his dad lets him get away with everything. Whenever there&#39;s a pretty face, he can&#39;t keep his mouth shut, and Daniela just happens to be his type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas kept talking, but realized Carol was unusually quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing over, he saw her give a thin smile, toss her popsicle stick in the bin, and then said, &#34;So that&#39;s what Mason said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas shrugged. &#34;We&#39;re all used to his nonsense by now-nobody realy manages to control him. Still,maybe you could go smooth things over for Daniela. Just say something nice to calm everyone down.You&#39;re here in Oiscoll-one apology isn&#39;t going to kill you. And Mason, well, losing both hands is pretty rough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a low chuckle and nodded. &#34;Alright, no problem. I&#39;Il apologize on behalf of Daniela.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare to see Carol this composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas raised an eyebrow, surprised by how easygoing she sounded. He grinned, shaking his head.′′Wow,didn&#39;t expect you to give in so quickly. Alright, just pick a time when my uncle&#39;s not around. He&#39;s still fuming,and if you show up now, he&#39;ll bite your head off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol gave a quick nod, her gaze drifting to the window where the daylight was already fading. &#34;Let&#39;s get this over with now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked, caught off guard by Carol&#39;s sudden decisiveness. &#34;Are you sure? It&#39;s pouring out there, and the storm looks nasty. Can&#39;t this wait until tomorrow? I get wanting to make things right for Daniela, but is it really worth rushing into a mess like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol offered no reply, her expression growing colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she headed to the storage room, pulled out a black raincoat, slipped it on, and strode right out into the downpour. Nikolas hesitated, stunned at how determined she seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re really just going to walk out there?&#34; He snapped out of it and hurried after her. &#34;Hang on, I&#39;ll come with you.Maybe I can help keep things from getting out of hand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they drove through the rain-slick streets, Carol&#39;s face remained unreadable, focused straight ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the passenger seat, Nikolas couldn&#39;t help filling the silence. &#34;You must really be in a hurry. But listen-there&#39;s something you should know. Mason&#39;s got a reputation for losing his temper. He had always thought the world owed him, treats people like garbage, and honestly, he&#39;s made a lot of enemies. Every time he messes up, my dad and uncle just sweep it under the rug. That&#39;s why he struts around like nothing can touch him. So if you&#39;re thinking your apology will change his mind, don&#39;t count on it. Hemight not even accept you apologizing on Daniela&#39;s behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept talking, but Carol&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on the road, her jaw set, the rain tapping steadily against the windshield.</p>
