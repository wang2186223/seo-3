                <p>Dexter couldn&#39;t shake the guilt gnawing at him after turning away a candidate who, on paper, was practically perfect for the job. Remorse clung to his features like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela caught sight of his conflicted expression and let out a soft laugh. &#34;Starting to regret it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not in the slightest,&#34; Dexter replied, his voice steady and sincere. &#34;Even if I had to do it all over again, I&#39;d still turn Alexander down the exact same way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small, approving nod. &#34;Good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single word made him pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she quickly added, &#34;Alexander wasn&#39;t being honest. He had an agenda, and he was not here for the job. You were absolutely right to shut it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, her tone softened. &#34;And honestly? You were standing up for my husband. That matters.I should be the one thanking you. So stop beating yourself up-you did the right thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dexter froze, still reeling. But as his eyes met Daniela&#39;s, something in his chest eased-her words had cut through his guilt like sunlight through fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a small, knowing smile. &#34;Get back to work. Don&#39;t waste another second thinking about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned and climbed the stairs. Dexter stayed rooted in place, muttering to himself, &#34;Of course she&#39;s the boss. She always knows how to say just the right thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crossing her arms tightly, Carol followed Daniela up the stairs, her gaze sharp and probing. &#34;Have you really lost your memories? You just called Cedric your husband. But back then, you said once the wind calmed,you&#39;d send him back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind had long calmed. And yet Cedric was still here,with no hint of leaving the country. Daniela offered a serene, unreadable smile as she stepped into her office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she instructed crisply, &#34;Tell Dexter this-any man trying to worm his way into the company with a hidden agenda, like Alexander,doesn&#39;t even deserve an interview.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carol let out a sharp click of her tongue and mumbled on her way out, &#34;You&#39;re spoiling him way too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Daniela arrived at the banquet with Carol trailing behind. Cedric had&#39;wanted to accompany her, but she&#39;d turned him down, citing his lingering cold and warning him not to push himself unnecessarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they stepped into the venue, Hamilton was already inside, proudly ushering Alexander around. &#34;Meet our newest project manager-Alexander Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Daniela entered, Alexander immediately spotted her. He arched a brow and lifted his glass in a casual salute. She didn&#39;t spare him so much as a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the cool dismissal, Hamilton scoffed under his breath. &#34;See? The guy&#39;s delusional. She couldn&#39;t care less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the words had settled, Alexander was already making his way toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, you look breathtaking tonight. May I have this dance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly had he finished speaking when the lights in the venue suddenly went dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush fell. Two lone spotlights flared on, sweeping dramatically across the ballroom before locking,in perfect unison, on Daniela and Alexander. The audience murmured, tension thick in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delighted by the theatrics, Alexander stepped forward and extended his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a soft, unreadable smile.Then, she pivoted on her heel, reached for the hand of a woman standing nearby, and pressed it firmly into Alexander&#39;s outstretched palm. The woman,who&#39;d been eyeing him all evening, gasped in surprise but didn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, music surged to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela backed away, heels clicking as she cleared the dance floor with graceful finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Alexander made to follow, but the woman now latched onto his hand tightened her grip, eyes gleaming with opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s secretary had wanted to snap a picture of Alexander and Daniela dancing, but his plan failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music filled the air. Alexander, cornered by the spotlight and expectations, reluctantly began to dance with the woman Daniela had shoved into his arms. But his gaze never left Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton let out a subtle chuckle and drifted to her side. &#34;Daniela, you&#39;ve still got it. Always one step ahead-always slipping the noose before it tightens.&#34; With a short, derisive laugh, she retorted,&#34;Interesting. The traps I escape always seem to be the ones you set. Must sting, Mr. McCoy. Try not to be upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then shifted her gaze to Hamilton&#39;s secretary.&#34;Sorry you didn&#39;t get the photo you wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she raised her phone and snapped a photo of Hamilton&#39;s furious scowl. &#34;That expression,though? I&#39;m keeping it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handing the phone over her shoulder to Carol,she commanded firmly, &#34;Send it to the team. I want this plastered on every screen in Oiscoll within the hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, a declaration like that might&#39;ve sounded like empty bravado. But not anymore. Earlier that afternoon, Daniela had acquired the media firm that dictated Oiscoll&#39;s trending headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, still clueless, let out a sharp scoff. &#34;What,you think posting dirt on me is as easy as snapping your fingers? Nothing goes live unless I say so. You should know that by noW.&#34; Daniela arched a brow, feigning astonishment. &#34;Such a domineering streak. Should I be frightened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Carol stepped forward, her voice crisp. &#34;It&#39;s live. Top of the trending chart. Exploding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s smug expression faltered. His secretary scrambled to unlock his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the room. No one actually believed Daniela. Surely she was bluffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the secretary read aloud, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hamilton&#39;s livid face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three words. That was all it took. Hamilton erupted in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged forward and ripped the phone from his secretary&#39;s hands, eyes narrowing as he stared at the screen.</p>
