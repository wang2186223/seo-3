                <p>Joyce observed Alexander&#39;s aloof behavior, her expression growing darker by the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was puzzled by the facade he presented, acting superior and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, when he was with Daniela, he had been nice to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, despite their marriage, he had remained distant, never once showing affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed the household staff had been whispering, for the entire circle of socialites was abuzz with talk that Alexander&#39;s marriage to her was devoid of love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They cruelly suggested he scorned her for her past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such vicious comments circulated, yet not a single member of the Bennett family rose to her defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, Joyce resolved to sleep with Alexander that evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, initiating contact had simplified matters for Katrina in her relationship with Caiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander wasoff to the side, silently nursing his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith approached, smirking, and taunted, &#34;Having regrets now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander responded only with silence, continuing to sip his drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith continued, &#34;I told you Joyce is no match for Daniela. You didn&#39;t believe me. Now, Daniela seems to have moved on with Cedric, leaving you in the dust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Alexander raised his head, his gaze sharp and cold. &#34;Has Daniela herself confirmed she&#39;s with Cedric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith answered confidently,′′|sit even necessary to ask? I may not know business, but I understand people.Daniela has always been cautious with herfeelings. She might have pursued you, yet she kept her distance emotionally. Was she ever truly intimate with you? Did she express any real desire? Have you ever actually been together physically? It&#39;s simple, Alexander. When a woman is truly interested in a man, she shows it,naturally wanting closeness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s expression darkened further. &#34;What&#39;s your point?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith concluded, &#34;My point is, whatever Daniela felt for you before was superficial. Now with Cedric, it&#39;s different. They share a chemistry that&#39;s palpable, and even if they haven&#39;t openly admitted it, it&#39;s obvious they share a connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At these words, Alexander&#39;s grip on his glass intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keith, sensing the tension, patted Alexander&#39;s shoulder regretfully. &#34;Forget it, you&#39;re not destined for Daniela. Just make it work with Joyce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The firmness in Alexander&#39;s grip on his glass intensified. He then turned his gaze to Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Joyce, with a glass in hand, was laughing loudly with her friends, displaying none of the poise expected of a refined lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Daniela stood elegantly under the soft lighting in a light blue gown, engaging confidently with executives.Her lively demeanor drew the attention of every man present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, Daniela, born into wealth, seemed worlds apart from the less polished Joyce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s face grew even more somber at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the evening progressed to the opening dance, led by Daniela, the moment to select a dance partner arrived. Alexander, hands now free from his pockets, fixed his eyes hopelessly on Daniela, wishing to be the chosen one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t even think about it,&#34; Joyce said, catching the longing look in Alexander&#39;s eyes. &#34;Daniela could pick anyone here, but she won&#39;t pick you. Not just because you&#39;re my husband, but because she doesn&#39;t revisit past romances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander was painfully aware of this reality. Yet, a faint hope flickered in his heart, filled with nervous anticipation. He clung to this unlikely possibility. However, his faint hope was dashed when Daniela, microphone in hand, announced Cedric&#39;s name,drawing the crowd&#39;s focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment engulfed Alexander, momentarily stopping his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela dance, he admired her grace and agility, her skirt twirling with the rhythm, captivating the onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand tensed by his side, reflecting the turmoil within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the dance concluded, his emotions remained in disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Daniela beam with joy on the dance floor, he was reminded painfully of their past together, and deep regret welled up inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compelled by a mix of frustration and yearning, he brushed past Joyce, who blocked his path, and approached Daniela with determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;May I have this dance?&#34; he asked, his tone commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Cedric intervened, positioning himself protectively before Daniela, his expression darkening with hostility.</p>
