                <p>In that moment, Elyse&#39;s heart skipped a beat as she caught sight of the icy smirk on Natalie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, we had an agreement, didn&#39;t we? All we wanted was to disrupt Nina&#39;s wedding so she&#39;d end up taking your place with Linden. You&#39;re not planning anything beyond that, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie, draped in a soft lavender gown, took a slow sip of her coffee, her gaze drifting to Elyse. With a faint smile, she said, &#34;Mom, as long as we achieve our goals, does it really matter what path we take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s unease deepened. &#34;She&#39;s still your sister,Natalie. Getting her involved with Linden is already too much. You can&#39;t go further than that. Once this is over, she&#39;ll still need to secure a good marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie let out a soft laugh, patting Elyse&#39;s hand reassuringly. &#34;Mom, why do you always fixate on marriage? Money is the real power in this world.With it, anything is possible. I promise you, whatever Nina endures today, I&#39;ll repay her a hundredfold someday Right now, we need to focus on taking down Daniela,gaining Elite Lux, and securing her fortune. Isn&#39;t that what truly matters?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse nodded, her doubts melting away like they&#39;d never existed. &#34;Yes, we have to get rid of Daniela!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie gazed at the moonlit expanse outside, her laughter ringing with triumph. &#34;Daniela, weren&#39;t you supposed to be so capable? Then why haven&#39;t you found Nina yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie reached for the coffee pot, bracing for a long night ahead, when her phone buzzed with an incoming call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The roar of wind filled the line as a man&#39;s urgent voice broke through. &#34;Miss Dury, I&#39;m sorry, but the other side is too powerful. We can&#39;t hold our ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could continue, Daniela&#39;s voice cut in, calm and sharp. &#34;Ah, so it&#39;s Natalie. Elyse must be there with you. Be sure to send her my regards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went dead with a soft beep, leaving Natalie frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, the smirk faded from her face, replaced by a flicker of panic. &#34;Mom, do you think Daniela will call the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse chuckled dismissively. &#34;Of course not. Besides,didn&#39;t you say you only had someone invite Nina out for coffee? Why would she involve the police?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elyse&#39;s forced smile vanished instantly as her eyes locked onto Natalie&#39;s panicked expression.Realization dawning, she asked, &#34;What did you do to Nina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela discovered Nina, she was barely clinging to consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood streaked across her body, her tattered clothes clinging by threads, and a sickening odor wafted from her battered frame. Bound and helpless, Nina was left in a crumbling warehouse, surrounded by slithering snakes and the rotting corpses of rats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In utter terror, Nina had succumbed to breakdowns again and again, her body overrun by ants and cockroaches, every breath a trembling challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Daniela stepped in, the vacant haze in Nina&#39;s eyes began to sharpen, inch by inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela, drawing on her psychology background,recognized the signs of extreme trauma-whether caused by a man or an animal-that could plunge a victim into a bottomless fear of intimacy and men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t a mere warning-it was a calculated,merciless act meant to shatter a person entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela swept the snakes aside with her foot, flung the decaying rats off Nina&#39;s frail body, and carefully poured alcohol over her skin to rid her of the ants and cockroaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s bloodshot, fear-stricken eyes lifted to meet Daniela&#39;s, brimming with anguish. In a trembling voice, she whispered, &#34;Daniela, my wedding will be cancelled,right?&#34;</p>
