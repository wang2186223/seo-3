                <p>Katrina radiated excitement, practically glowing. She let go of Caiden&#39;s hand and stepped towards Joyce,positioning herself confidently before turning to address Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric Phillips, Daniela&#39;s close friend, right? I&#39;m Daniela&#39;s stepmother. Please, feel free to call me Katrina.&#34; She extended her hand towards him,her face adorned with a polished, almost-too-perfect smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cedric didn&#39;t budge. His hands stayed buried in his pockets, his sharp eyes surveying the room with a frigid intensity. He didn&#39;t so much as glance at her offered hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere tensed with Cedric&#39;s arrival. His sheer presence was enough to command the room,halting the movers mid-task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Starting a move this early in the morning?&#34; Cedric asked, his lips curling into a faint, sardonic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s hand hung in the air awkwardly for a moment,but her polished demeanor didn&#39;t falter. She recovered, letting out a light, breezy laugh and adopting an effortless tone. &#34;No, not moving! Daniela  still lives here. It&#39;s just that Joyce felt some of the furniture and decorations didn&#39;t quite align with Daniela&#39;s style. We were discussing some upgrades to better suit her taste. As parents, it&#39;s only natural we want her to have the best. She lives alone, after all,and we want her to feel comfortable and well taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s ability to twist the narrative to her favor was nearly flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stating the truth-that they were pillaging the home -would paint her as selfish and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But framing it as an effort to enhance Daniela&#39;s living situation made her sound thoughtful,even selfless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had mastered this technique over the years,crafting the image of a loving, supportive stepmother everyone admired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper could only stare in stunned silence,knowing the stark contrast between Katrina&#39;s words and her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she even saying now? Just moments ago,this woman had been barking orders and laying claim to anything she fancied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The housekeeper&#39;s anxiety surged as she glanced at Cedric, silently praying he wouldn&#39;t be fooled by Katrina&#39;s sudden change in demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric remained unmoved, his expression cold and unreadable as he pulled a chair ov/er and settled into it with deliberate calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp gaze flicked briefly towards the movers handling the fish tank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, the fish tank and the fish that I gifted aren&#39;t good enough? Is that it? Are you saying my gift doesn&#39;t suit this house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut through the room like a blade, the underlying warning impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden sprang to his feet, his face draining of color.&#34;No! Of course not! How could we ever think that?Your gift is, naturally, the best of the best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew all too well that Cedric, despite his youth,was infamous for his ruthless business acumen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One snap decision from him could dismantle entire empires or obliterate competitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t someone to provoke lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing there with an awkward, forced smile,Caiden tried to salvage the situation. But Cedric didn&#39;t even glance at him, his attention fixed coolly on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the room was suffocating. Caiden  and Katrina stood rigid, while the movers exchanged uneasy glances, unsure whether to proceed or abandon the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence stretched unbearably, thick with tension,until one of the movers hesitantly broke it. &#34;Should we keep moving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question shattered the stillness, but instead of diffusing the tension, it seemed to amplify it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze darted nervously towards Cedric,whose finger had paused mid-swipe on his phone screen.That small motion alone made Caiden&#39;s throat tighten as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,we&#39;ll leave the fish tank exactly where it is,&#34;Katrina chimed in with a saccharine smile, desperate to defuse thesituation. &#34;But perhaps we could take a few of the other items? Just the ones that don&#39;t quite fit the decor here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her greed peeked through her polished facade, unable to suppress her true intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s furniture was a testament to impeccable taste. The sofa, made of solid rosewood and adorned with buttery-soft leather cushions, far surpassed anything Katrina could boast of at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only natural that she wanted to take the best pieces back with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the fish tank and Cedric&#39;s other gifts? Those could wait. Once Cedric left, she&#39;d return to claim them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was already clear in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Phillips, would that be alright?&#34; Caiden&#39;s voice was tentative, measured with caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,however, didn&#39;t even lift his head. His attention stayed fixed on his phone, his finger scrolling as if oblivious to the tension around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He neither agreed nor refused, leaving Caiden in a painfully awkward limbo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The oppressive silence in the room grew thicker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,the faint creak of a door opening upstairs broke the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone except Cedric exhaled in relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela was finally coming downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden, shaken from his uneasy trance, felt a cold sweat drench his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he found himself actually eager to see his biological daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela,&#34; he called out, his voice uncharacteristically soft as he watched her descend the stairs. &#34;You&#39;re finally awake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone, unusually gentle and warm, carried the practiced air of a caring father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Daniela had longed for even a moment like this-for her father to speak to her with such kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Caiden&#39;s tenderness had always been reserved for Joyce.Never her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fragile hope had withered and died long ago,buried beneath years of neglect and indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela descended the stairs, her expression composed and unreadable. Her gaze drifted over the scene in the living room, pausing on the movers standing uncertainly amid the disarrayed furniture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their uniforms, a deep green, bore the company&#39;s slogan in bold letters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We bring happiness back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word &#34;home&#34; struck Daniela with a wave of bitter irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t known the meaning of that word in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s eyes roved across the room, finally settling on Cedric, whose calm demeanor stood in stark  contrast to the tense atmosphere. Then her attention shifted to the housekeeper,her swollen, tear-streaked face speaking volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes gradually hardened, a shadow darkening their depths.</p>
