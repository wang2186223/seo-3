                <p>Nikolas recoiled, struck by the sharp wave of hostility radiating from Daniela</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice quivered with caution as he asked, &#34;What more do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words escaped like a low growl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s gaze was icily detached. &#34;Don&#39;t you enjoy toying with what others hold dear? Well, I&#39;ll make you feel the sting of losing something you cherish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes flew open in disbelief. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; His mind whirled, scrambling to figure out what she could possibly be talking about. What was it he held dear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, a vivid image of an island flashed before his eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, he had started turning the island intohis escape route. If he wasn&#39;t chosen as the McCoy family&#39;s heir, the fortune hidden there would be his foundation to build his own business empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This fortune was his anchor, a reservoir of self-assurance built over years, and it was his secret,known  only to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; heart thudded in his chest, but he quickly steadied himself-there was no way Daniela could know about the island</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Hamilton was aware of his hidden refuge How could she possibly know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinging to that thought, Nikolas managed to steady himself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed the lump in his throat,locking eyes with Daniela &#34;McCoy Group is all that matters to me. Are you targeting it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his words came to an end,Daniela&#39;s lips curled into a faint,knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Are you absolutely sure McCoy Group is all that matters to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was sure Daniela couldn&#39;t possibly know his secret, her question sent a ripple of unease through him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat up stiffly in the hospital bed,eyes locking onto Daniela. &#34;What do you mean?&#34; His voice spiked with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton, taken aback, turned his head to look at Nikolas. Nikolas recognized his lapse in control but couldn&#39;t rein in his emotions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That island, and the fortune buried within it, was the one thing that meant everything to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without it, all the sweat and sacrifices of the years would crumble into nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Danielal What are you really trying to say?&#34; Nikolas snarled through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela scoffed,her voice dripping with mockery′′SO you&#39;re scared? Even you have your moments of fear I thought you were always the picture of calm. How does it feel to have someone threaten you with the thing you hold dear? Frightened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of humiliation burned through Nikolas as he caught the flicker of disappointment in Hamilton&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched, his voice dropping to a low growl &#34;Enough, Daniela. I&#39;ve told you already-McCoy Group is all that matters to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in the face of everything, a tiny thread of hope remained within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela regarded him with cold indifference.&#34;McCoy Group is all that matters to you? Fine, then I&#39;ll help you rid yourself of what you truly don&#39;t care about!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Nikolas like a vice, squeezing his chest in a wave of unease &#34;You &#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could utter another word, Hamilton interjected, &#34;Daniela, what are you implying? Stop speaking in riddles. What else does Nikolas care about?Just say it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton wasn&#39;t one to be easily deceived</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen the assurance in Daniela&#39;s stance and the growing tension in Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, was there something more to Nikolas than McCoy Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton understood Nikolas completely Women didn&#39;t interest him-only power and wealth did. So, if there was something else..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton&#39;s eyes narrowed with growing suspicion. Did Nikolas hide away a secret fortune somewhere else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent a deep frown creasing across Hamilton&#39;s brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury boiled inside Nikolas, but with Hamilton in the room,he had no choice but to hold it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s soft chuckle echoed in his ears, her words a whisper meant only for Nikolas. &#34;What do you think would happen if I blew that island sky-high? Would the treasures hidden within rise to the surface and make the newS?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment,the truth dawned on Nikolas-Daniela knew his deepest secret</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze locked on her, wide-eyed in disbelief</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t fathom why she hadn&#39;t used it against him sooner if she&#39;d known all along Why hadn&#39;t she threatened him with it before? Why was she revealing it now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela pierced through his thoughts with ease,her voice calm as she spoke I stayed silent before because I dismissed it. I foolishly hoped that, in a family,there might be a glimmer of tenderness. That&#39;s why I refrained from going to extremes. But now, I realize l was wrong. Since you never intended to show Cedric any mercy, I won&#39;t hold back any longer&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas blinked in surprise, his gaze fixed on Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never anticipated that Daniela would show such concern for Cedric</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected someone as powerful and wealthy as Daniela to still care about family ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Born into the fractured Harper family, Daniela had long since abandoned any hope of family unity within the wealthy elite. Yet, she still clung to the hope that Cedric could have more family beyond his grandmother</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Cedric himself remained indifferent, Daniela clung to that hope, wishing that the McCoy family might offer him at least a sliver of kindness But now,it seemed she no longer needed to spare them any mercy</p>
