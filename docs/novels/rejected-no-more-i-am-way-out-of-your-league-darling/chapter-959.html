                <p>Reclining against the headboard,Josh let out a harsh.mocking chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethan raised his voice. &#34;Nobody else needs to get involved here.I handed over more than twenty billion to Josh, and he&#39;s only offering three million in return.Even when I agreed to take just twenty billion back,he refused. Fine. If that&#39;s how it is, we&#39;ll all go down together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing in Josh&#39;s experience with Ethan prepared him for such bold defiance from someone usually so meek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown darkening his features, he responded coldly, &#34;You&#39;re acting tough now, are you? Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t notice what&#39;s going on. Ethan, you&#39;ve met Daniela,haven&#39;t you? Did she promise you something,which is why you&#39;re here asking me for money?Hamilton, I see you&#39;re getting pretty daring, too.You&#39;ve even picked up a few tricks behind my back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his name dragged into the fray, Hamilton blinked, caught off guard by the accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could fire back, a sudden knock interrupted the standoff. Hamilton&#39;s secretary said, &#34;Mr. McCoy, may I speak with you outside for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pointed snort from Josh made his feelings clear,he looked at Hamilton as if to say, &#34;Caught you,traitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hamilton found himself brimming with frustration at the way Josh responded, each word only adding fuel to his growing irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice climbed higher with fury as he shouted,&#34;Why are you hiding everything? Speak up and tell the truth right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary hesitated, clearly uncomfortable. &#34;You want me to say it here? In front of everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; replied Hamilton, standing his ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he had no choice,the secretary replied,&#34;The doctor stopped by today to check on Daniela. He just called to let me know she&#39;s a little underweight. Since she&#39;s carrying twins, this could become a problem.The doctor suggests hiring a nutritionist. But he also said that Daniela was always in good health, and Cedric&#39;s been taking good care of her. The real issue is that she just isn&#39;t eating enough. With twins, the whole family should keep an eye on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by the update, Hamilton found himself at a loss for words. It took a few moments before he could react at all. Scratching his head in confusion, he finally muttered,n&#34;Too thin? Is Daniela too thin? I can&#39;t tell her what to eat.How could this happen?&#34; Several seconds passed as Hamilton struggled to process the news, his mind drawing a complete blank. Realization dawned, and Hamilton jerked his head up.r&#34;Did I hear you right? Twins?&#34; aithe secretary grinned. &#34;Yes, twins. But we don&#39;t know snyet if they&#39;re boys or girls.&#34; Stunned, Hamilton struggled to process the news. His gaze swept the room, Jarvis was grinning ear to ear,while everyone else wore sour expressions. &#34;Twins!&#34; Hamilton slapped his thigh. &#34;Daniela&#39;s azamazing! This is fantastic. I have to head out. There&#39;s EvEo much to take care of. With twins on the way and erhy daughter-in-law looking so frail, I need to make zirure she&#39;s alright. Surely, at least one will be a boy. My nitirst grandson, at last!&#34; sode rushed out the door, Brad hurrying after him like a iteyal shadow. sense of pride washed over Brad as he pictured his amily&#39;s future growing even brighter. of prosperity danced in his mind-his years of effort finally paying off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling, Ethan barely registered the vibration of his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A headline flashed on the screen. &#34;New McCoy Group Launched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage flashed in Ethan&#39;s eyes as he spun toward Josh.&#34;Give me my money or I swear, you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News of the impending twins, along with Cedric and Daniela&#39;s business savvy, could only mean McCoy Group was poised to reach even greater heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, what did Josh have to show for himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to them, Josh looked insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Josh&#39;s face. Daniela and Cedric were having twins. The news was a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it, Ethan. Once I&#39;ve got the money,it&#39;s not coming back. Not even if you kill me.&#34; His tone left no room for argument.</p>
