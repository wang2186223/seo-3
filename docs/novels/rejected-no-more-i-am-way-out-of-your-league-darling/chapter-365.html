            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s brows knitted in confusion as she grabbed Joyce by the arm, her voice filled with disbelief.&#34;Joyce, are you out of your mind? Keeping Alexander a lover is one thing, but why would you bring him to the banquet? If Doug finds out, not only will your marriage be over, but your life will be in danger too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce took a seat calmly. &#34;Mom, don&#39;t make it a bigger deal than it is. Doug thinks little of anyone in Olisvine except Daniela. He barely interacts with anyone here and only comes home for two days each month. When he does, he&#39;s too wrapped up in having sex with me to care about rumors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce spoke with unshakable confidence. &#34;And let&#39;s not forget, Doug&#39;s desires are endless. Do you really think he&#39;s being faithful? Why can he step out,but l can&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Joyce, don&#39;t you get it?Whoever controls the money controls everything.Men can be unfaithful, but they won&#39;t tolerate their wives stepping out. It&#39;s not about love-it&#39;s about ownership. By being his wife, you&#39;re his image, and if he finds out you&#39;ve betrayed him, he won&#39;t let you go.You&#39;ve got a good life, yet you&#39;re throwing it away for Alexander. I heard he charges a million per night for  a night with you. Is he some kind of goldmine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce glanced over at Alexander. The sharp edge that once defined him had softened, replaced by a docile,submissive aura. She was oddly drawn to this state of submission. Being the center of Alexander&#39;s universe thrilled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, you&#39;ve never been through it,so you wouldn&#39;t get the satisfaction,&#34; Joyce replied, her tone casual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina paused, shutting her eyes for a moment. &#34;Fine.I didn&#39;t come here to argue. Daniela promised to let me stay in the Harper family&#39;s villa if I give her a million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce frowned just a bit upon hearing that. &#34;You&#39;ve been asking me for money a lot recently. I remember giving you some just a couple of weeks ago. Mom,I might have married a rich man, but he doesn&#39;t treat me like a person: Money doesn&#39;t come easy,you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her frustration was evident in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she quickly wrote out a check and tossed it towards Katrina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The check landed awkwardly, slapping Katrina&#39;s face,a clear sign of Joyce&#39;s impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina was shocked. She looked down at the check on the floor, then stared at Joyce in disbelief. Unmoved, Joyce turned her head, catching sight of Daniela making her way to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk spread across Joyce&#39;s face, as if she were eager to flaunt a rare prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander, peel a shrimp for me,&#34; she commanded,her tone firm, catching the attention of those nearby who loved a bit of drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They eagerly awaited to see how the once-proud man now knelt for money under Joyce&#39;s control,wondering if Daniela, his ex-wife, still had any ounce of sympathy left for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander gripped the shrimp in his hand, already numb from the many humiliations he had endured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce took pleasure in showing him off, flaunting how the man who once rejected her now groveled like a dog desperate for her approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had long since hardened to such demeaning moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today was different-Daniela was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new wave of humiliation hit Alexander, despite Daniela&#39;s silence. His cheeks slowly turned red with shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can still blush? I thought all his pride had been wiped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? Did you hear? Just yesterday in a bar,Joyce made Alexander kneel and lick spilled beer off the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with shock, everyone leaning in,eager for more. &#34;And then? What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speaker dragged out the words with a mocking tone. &#34;Then Joyce tossed him a million, and he just took it. So, you see-men shouldn&#39;t get too cocky.Watch out, or you might end up like Alexander, with your dignity crushed underfoot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted in laughter as the words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alexander&#39;s hands shook ever so slightly as he held the shrimp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce saw Daniela and sneered, keeping her eyes on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela had always been the one people noticed, and that was still true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the men in the room were watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela ate calmly while Cedric whispered something to her. She nodded, and he smiled gently, his eyes full of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Joyce could see it, but Cedric gently squeezed Daniela&#39;s fingers in a gesture full of tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was a powerful figure in the business world,yet before Daniela, he always lowered his guard, offering her nothing but affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce&#39;s hands balled into fists, her eyes blazing with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alexander! You fool! You can&#39;t even peel a shrimp right. What use are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, a sharp slap rang through the room.</p>
