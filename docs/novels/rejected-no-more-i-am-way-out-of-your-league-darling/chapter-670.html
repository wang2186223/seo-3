                <p>Nikolas was completely taken aback to discover that all the mercenaries had disappeared without a trace overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat in the car,his eyes darting suspiciously between Cedric and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Cedric be responsible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps it was Daniela?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Cedric&#39;s legs and then Daniela&#39;s slender figure, Nikolas found himself puzzled by their involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Daniela and Cedric were seated in the front seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric whispered, &#34;Daniela, if this is too much, should we consider other options?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Daniela&#39;s penchant for cleanliness and Nikolas &#39;potential for causing disturbances, Cedric feared that Nikolas might distress Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He questioned whether the hassle was justified just for one business transaction. &#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; Daniela responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his seat at the back, Nikolas scoffed audibly,&#34;Such a coward!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they arrived at Daniela&#39;s villa, Caiden and Joyce were silently struck by the remarkable resemblance between Nikolas and Cedric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Nikolas stepped inside, Daniela exchanged a meaningful glance with Caiden, hinting that he should scrutinize Nikolas carefully to confirm if he was indeed the one who had saved him from the mental institution previously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they gathered at the dinner table, Caiden positioned himself next to Nikolas,frequently lifting his glass. &#34;A warm welcome to you, Mr. McCoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden had already downed over a dozen glasses,yet Nikolas remained indifferent, merely taking a sip of his drink, far from any state of intoxication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning towards Cedric with a challenging look,Nikolas asked, &#34;Mr. Phillips, won&#39;t you offer a toast in my honor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric,who had been prescribed medication recently,had received a doctor&#39;s call that morning, advising him against any alcohol consumption. The mix of his medication with alcohol was risky,possibly detrimental to his health-a fact Nikolas knew well,making his challenge a deliberate provocation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas eyed Cedric tauntingly, his smirk broadening.&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Scared to share a drink with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Caiden was about to intervene, Daniela chuckled and said, &#34;Mr. McCoy, allow me to offer you a toast first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing Daniela&#39;s words, Caiden resumed his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her youth, Daniela was frequently escorted by Brylee to various social events. Following Brylee&#39;s departure, Caiden assumed that role. Daniela always managed to hold her ground with experienced drinkers, often wrapping up the evening with a late-night snack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Daniela now intervening on Cedric&#39;s behalf,Caiden felt reassured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He craned his neck, attempting to scrutinize Nikolas &#39; hand, yet the poor angle thwarted a clear view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas&#39; eyes shifted between Cedric and Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason,Daniela seemed more daunting to him than Cedric. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Mr. McCoy? Are you scared?&#34; Daniela asked,echoing NJikolas&#39; earlier taunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nikolas&#39; expression began to sour, Daniela asked him further, &#34;What&#39;s the matter, Mr. McCoy?Can&#39;t handle a toast from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas responded defiantly, &#34;Let&#39;s do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was merely a drink, after all. Surely, it wouldn&#39;t kill him to share one with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s confidence irritated him immensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a knowing smile, Daniela remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing tension, Joyce instinctively wrapped her arms around Jack and stepped back. Whenever Daniela wore that particular smile, trouble was sure to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela moved to the bar, skillfully selected several bottles, and with a flourish of deft bartending skills,set a glass filled with vibrant red wine before Nikolas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured herself a glass and lightly tapped hers against Nikolas&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, she said,′′TCo your visit at Olisvine,Mr. McCoy. It&#39;s going to be memorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela sipped her wine gracefully to the last drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing her smile, Nikolas threw his head back and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>finished his wine in one gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wine was gentle on the palate, carrying a subtle hint of cool rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nikolas found the flavor quite agreeable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just considering requesting another mix from Daniela when his eyes started to blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning towards Daniela, he saw her smile fading into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, his head hit the table with a resounding thud</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden stood in shock, his jaw dropped open. &#34;He went down after just one drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded, &#34;Quit rambling and look at his hand.&#34;</p>
