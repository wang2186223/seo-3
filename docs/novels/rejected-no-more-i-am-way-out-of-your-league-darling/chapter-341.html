                <p>Alexander initially assumed the ordeal would be over within an hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Women and indulgence had never been his weakness, nor did he care for indulgence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when Joyce unleashed her endless repertoire of tricks, Alexander was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Alexander understood why Joyce had managed to remain Doug&#39;s woman for so long and even become his wife-it was no coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As tension built, the veins on Alexander&#39;s forehead throbbed, and he couldn&#39;t help but wish it were Daniela in Joyce&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One full day and night crawled by. When Alexander finally left, his body felt drained and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, her lips curling into a smug smile, called out,&#34;Feel free to reach out if you ever have the need again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his disciplined workout routine, Alexander boasted a chiseled physique far superior to Doug&#39;s,whose age had long dulled his vigor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joyce, meanwhile, lay sprawled across the bed, her deep sleep lasting for hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Alexander exited the hotel, his phone vibrated,notifying him of a money transfer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His bank account showed a deposit of fifty million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment, Alexander hesitated, tempted to stick to his principles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Joyce&#39;s earlier words echoed in his mind-beforehand, morality had seemed insurmountable, and the idea of taking money felt wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with fifty million staring him in the face,Alexander rationalized it as fair payment for a day and night&#39;s work. Why refuse? He convinced himself it was well-earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final glance at his phone, Alexander silently accepted the deposit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using the funds, he steadily expanded his business,and Bennett Group&#39;s operations began to bounce back piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, Joyce approached Alexander several times, dangling alluring offers in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Alexander declined each time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to forge his own path to success in Olisvine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His confidence in himself was unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela remained indifferent to such affairs. She knew Caiden had beaten Katrina up multiple times. Eventually, Katrina approached Daniela, wearing the same submissive demeanor Alexander once had.&#34;I&#39;m not asking for much. Give me five million, and I&#39;ll divorce Caiden right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela responded with a soft chuckle. &#34;I never wanted you two to divorce. Haven&#39;t you realized that by now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina countered, &#34;But you&#39;ve got no proof, so you can&#39;t do anything to me. Instead of keeping me around as a daily nuisance, why not let me leave?swear I&#39;ll disappear from Olisvine-you can pretend I&#39;m dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela offered a faint smile. &#34;You want me to pretend you&#39;re dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina nodded eagerly, her desperation evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not quite the same as being truly dead,&#34;Daniela commented dryly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina narrowed her eyes. &#34;Daniela, I came here to settle things peacefully, but if you&#39;re unwilling, don&#39;t blame me for being ruthless. Do you want a repeat of those &#39;accidents&#39;?&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s faint smile lingered. &#34;Feel free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina stormed away, pulling out her phone as soon as she reached the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this all you&#39;re capable of? Back when you had me take care of Brylee, you were so decisive. Now I&#39;m being targeted by Daniela while you sit back and reap the benefits like nothing ever happened. Do you really think that&#39;s fair? Make Daniela disappear within a week, or I&#39;ll spill everything to her about what happened back then. I&#39;m warning you, Daniela isn&#39;t like Brylee. She has powerful allies, with money and influence. They could crush you with ease, and you know it. You&#39;ve got one week-if Daniela&#39;s still alive,we all go down together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katrina ended the call angrily, her gaze drifting towards the villa as her eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, she suddenly spotted Caiden. It was obvious he had overheard her phone call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better act like you heard nothing and keep your mouth shut, or you&#39;ll be the first to go,&#34; Katrina hissed before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, as Daniela arrived at work, she noticed Caiden loitering in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daniela, I swear I had nothing to do with any of it.Please, let me move back into the villa,&#34; he pleaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Daniela reached for her car door, Caiden hurriedly said, &#34;I overheard Katrina on the phone yesterday-she admitted to killing your mother.You shouldn&#39;t be blaming me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela&#39;s brows furrowed slightly. &#34;Are you claiming you had nothing to do with it?&#34; she asked, her tone colder than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden&#39;s gaze wavered nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, my mother would still be alive.Your greed and vanity set all of this in motion. Do you truly claim no responsibility? You could&#39;ve fallen for anyone else. You could&#39;ve just divorced my mother.But you were too tied to her money to let her go. And in all these years, did it never cross your mind that Katrina might&#39;ve been the one who killed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caiden quickly retorted, &#34;No, really, I didn&#39;t. It was all Katrina! I share some blame, but the majority of it falls on her. You can&#39;t pin everything on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to gain her sympathy, Caiden added,&#34;Daniela, I&#39;m getting old-I can&#39;t handle much more of this. The small house is freezing, and I just can&#39;t endure it anymore. Let me come back to the house.Deal with Katrina however you want, but please, just let me return.&#34;</p>
