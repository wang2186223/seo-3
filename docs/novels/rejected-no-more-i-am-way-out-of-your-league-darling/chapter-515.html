                <p>Cedric&#39;s secretary entered with a tray of fruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he stepped in, he caught the word &#34;bankruptcy&#34; and nearly dropped the tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bankruptcy?&#34; He snapped his head towards Daniela in alarm.′′Ms. Harper, does Elite Lux&#39;s secretary department happen to need a capable male secretary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela let out a small, amused smile</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary,however,remained completely serious, his expression almost reverent. &#34;I mean it.I&#39;ve wanted to join Elite Lux for the longest time. If Phillips Group actually went under, would you consider taking me in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric turned to glare at the secretary he had worked with for years, his gaze sharp and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he strode past him and headed straight for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering himself onto the seat beside her, Cedric softened his tone. &#34;I can cook, clean, and even keep the bed warm. I don&#39;t cost much either-just enough to make ends meet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood there in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just enough to make ends meet?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wouldn&#39;t do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he had already lost this battle, the secretary sulked in defeat while Cedric threw Daniela a victorious smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela simply smiled back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She agreed immediately, hoping Cedric would always be as carefree and lighthearted as he was in that moment. At noon, Cedric had the secretary bring lunch to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told Daniela, &#34;I have a client meeting at noon. After lunch, you can rest in the lounge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod of agreement,and Cedric left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he made his way to the second-floor canteen, he glanced out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The traffic below moved smoothly, thestreets appearing peaceful, but Cedric knew better. Beneath that calm surface, unseen threats lurked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone and called his subordinate, Rex Patel. &#34;What&#39;s the situation now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex chuckled. &#34;Situation? What situation? Shadow&#39;s already handled it. There&#39;s nothing she can&#39;t take care of. But I heard the leader of Extinction has his sights set on you. Better watch your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Extinction was a fast-rising gang-ruthless, merciless, and bound by no code. They would do anything for the right price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, word had spread that their leader had ambitions of becoming the new underworld overlord, wiping out several major organizations to clear his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never crossed paths with Cealmaur before, but this time, things felt different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard their leader publicly challenged Clarinda to a one-on-one fight. No word yet on how Cealmaur&#39;s responding,&#34; Rex added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;Find out more about Clarida&#39;s and Shadow&#39;s market prices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever the circumstances, they had been dragged into this because of him. It was only right that he paid them accordingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rex hesitated. &#34;Cedric, Shadow might have a price, but Clarinda... If you want her market rate, well, let&#39;s just say it might cost you your entire fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew that Cealmaur&#39;s leader wasn&#39;t a legend for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Cealmaur first emerged, they took the mercenary world by storm with only two people-the leader and Shadow. Even when multiple rival gangs banded together to crush them, they failed spectacularly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That battle wiped out their enemies and reshaped the entire criminal underworld, sending shockwaves through every faction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, no one had dared to challenge the authority of Cealmaur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Shadow had vanished for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cedric, level with me. Do you know Cealmaur&#39;s leader? Otherwise, why would she be stepping in because of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric narrowed his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard he searched his memory, he couldn&#39;t recall any connection between himself and Clarinda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But one thing was certain-he hated owing anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela woke from her nap to a message from Lillian lighting up her phone screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at it, then headed to the bathroom to freshen up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After splashing cold water on her face, she tied her hair into a neat ponytail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of Cedric&#39;s lounge, she found him at his desk, punching numbers into a calculator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you working on?&#34; she asked, approaching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric muttered, &#34;I need to keep a small company intact for a future comeback and liquidate the rest.&#34; He pressed the intercom and said, &#34;Have the finance department calculate the full value of Phillips Group&#39;s assets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, his expression remained a mix of seriousness and ease, as if he had already accepted the weight of the decision. Yet, beneath it all, there was something unreadable in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honey, I&#39;m deep in debt and need to pay it off in cash. You okay with that?&#34; Daniela responded without hesitation, &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary standing nearby swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this couple stop talking about billion-dollar assets like they were discussing the weather?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered,Daniela resumed playing her video game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric mentioned he had a meeting in the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela gave a small nod, and once he left, she finished her game, stretched her neck, and told the secretary, &#34;I&#39;m heading downstairs for a walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;Would you like me to accompany you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daniela shook her head. &#34;I&#39;m just taking a quick tour of the departments. No need to tag along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary&#39;s excitement deflated instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, Cedric wrapped up his meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of regret hit him-he should have kept Daniela close. It was too dangerous these days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he returned to his office and saw it empty, his pulse skyrocketed.&#34;Where&#39;s my wife?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His secretary bolted out of the department, pointing to the lower floors. &#34;She said she was touring the departments downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric&#39;s expression darkened. Without another word, he rushed into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary stood frozen. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with Mr. Phillips? I&#39;ve never seen him this rattled. His wife is just walking around the company, not leaving the building. What&#39;s he so worked up about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What possible danger could there be in Cedric&#39;s own company?</p>
