                <p>Surprisingly, Cedric&#39;s focus was elsewhere, and he seemed irritated by Nina blocking his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina briefly shut her eyes,wondering if something was wrong with Cedric&#39;s sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How else could he resist her appeal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina took a deep breath, and just as Cedric was about to turn and walk away, she let out a soft, dramatic &#34;Oh dear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was for Cedric to turn around, and then she&#39;d pretend to faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unfortunately, Cedic didn&#39;t even look back and just kept walking. Nina gritted her teeth and fake-fell to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, her &#34;Oh dear!&#34; was much louder, enough to catch Cedric&#39;s attention. He turned around, but his expression was one of clear impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear and said in a sad tone, &#34;Cedric, I twisted my ankle. Could you help me up?&#34; She raised her arms and pouted. Cedric paused for a moment. &#34;You, take her back to the Dury family,&#34; he ordered, looking at his bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could protest, the strong bodyguard crouched down and picked her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina cried out, quickly jumping out of the bodyguard&#39;s hold. &#34;I think I&#39;m fine now. My ankle&#39;s better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric shot her an irritated look before walking off,still searching for Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina had no care for what happened to Daniela.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept pace with Cedric, her voice soft yet persistent. &#34;Cedric, you&#39;ve been walking for more than half an hour. Aren&#39;t you tired? How about we take a break at this hotel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina made the suggestion, but seeing Cedric remain unaffected, she pushed further. &#34;Cedric, you really don&#39;t have to worry. Daniela is strong, almost like a man. She probably went home. There&#39;s a nice cafe nearby. Let me buy you coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina couldn&#39;t help but admire Cedric&#39;s striking profile,made even more captivating by the glow of the night lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart fluttered with desire, and without thinking,  she reached out and tugged at his sleeve. In a soft,teasing tone, she said, &#34;Cedric, could you slow down a little? You&#39;re walking so fast, I can hardly keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was anxious and frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a short temper, and Nina&#39;s constant attempts to get close had drained all his patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly spun around and looked at Nina coldly,who was staring at him with longing eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was cold as he asked, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina bit her lip, replying, &#34;Don&#39;t you know what I want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out playfully, trying to touch Cedric&#39;s chest, but he stepped back to avoid her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t,&#34; he answered, his voice distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina cast her eyes down, her voice gentle and alluring.&#34;I understand your feelings for Daniela, but the truth is,she&#39;s only focused on her work. If she cared about you,she wouldn&#39;t have kept you waiting all this time.Cedric, I&#39;ve had feelings for you for so long. Don&#39;t you notice me? When I was younger, my aunt always said I resembled Daniela a lot. People used to think we were twins. I care about you, Cedric, and I&#39;m not bothered by the idea of being the one you lean on when she&#39;s out of reach. I don&#39;t mind at all.&#34; She took a step closer. Nina&#39;s words came from the heart, and soon, tears began to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People passing by glanced over, pitying the delicate woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think you can compare to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina believed her honesty would touch Cedric, but instead,he gave her a cold and dismissive reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was taken aback. &#34;Cedric, Daniela doesn&#39;t feel the same way about you. No matter how much you try,you&#39;re just another one of her admirers. She enjoys the attention, but she won&#39;t treat you like a boyfriend.Can&#39;t you see that? You&#39;re just a backup to her. The moment someone else catches her eye, she&#39;ll leave you behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric answered bluntly, &#34;Is that so? I&#39;m fine being a backup. I&#39;m happy to be Daniela&#39;s backup forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s face darkened at his words. &#34;What did you just say? Cedric, are you out of your mind? You&#39;re the wealthiest man in the country, the one every woman dreams of. You should be soaking up their admiration,and yet you&#39;re willing to settle as Daniela&#39;s backup?That&#39;s insane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was nothing if not direct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to relationships, he was careful, always Nina&#39;s words came from the heart, and soon, tears began to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People passing by glanced over, pitying the delicate woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think you can compare to Daniela?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina believed her honesty would touch Cedric, but instead, he gave her a cold and dismissive reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was taken aback. &#34;Cedric, Daniela doesn&#39;t feel the same way about you. No matter how much you try,you&#39;re just another one of her admirers.

                <p>Cedric answered bluntly, &#34;Is that so? I&#39;m fine being a backup. I&#39;m happy to be Daniela&#39;s backup forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina&#39;s face darkened at his words. &#34;What did you just say? Cedric, are you out of your mind? You&#39;re the wealthiest man in the country, the one every woman dreams of. You should be soaking up their admiration,and yet you&#39;re willing to settle as Daniela&#39;s backup?That&#39;s insane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cedric was nothing if not direct. When it came to relationships, he was careful, always keeping a respectful distance from women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never hesitated to make his rejections clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m okay with being Daniela&#39;s backup, but I don&#39;t need a replacement. No one can replace her, not in this world. You might look like her in some ways,but you have to understand, beauty goes beyond appearance. There&#39;s something about Daniela that you&#39;ll never have. You might seem similar on the outside, but inside? It&#39;s a whole different story. You&#39;ll never match her, not now, not ever. Do you get it?|can&#39;t stand anyone but Daniela getting close to me,touching me, or trying to please me. It makes me sick!And I won&#39;t tolerate a single word spoken against her in my presence. From now on, stay away from me.And don&#39;t call me Cedric. Call me Mr. Phillips,understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and walked away, his back cold and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina was left standing there, stunned, trying to process what she had just heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything she had done, Cedric rejected her so decisively, without a care for how it made her feel.</p>
