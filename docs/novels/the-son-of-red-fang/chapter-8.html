                <p>(Cole’s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I follow behind Alpha Demetri and his son a short way across the main hall on the first floor. They stop at the first door theye to, the numbers 101A are screwed into the center. I stop a few feet from them as I have a preference for keeping my distance from everyone. I only get close to those I’ve observed for a while and I have a motive for learning from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear a short beep briefly before the sound of the door unlocking. Alpha pushes down on the handle and allows the door to swing open before looking back at me and encouraging me to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move cautiously as I have never been beaten this badly by my dad before going to another pack’s territory. I would think the risk of another alpha discovering my secret rtionship with my father would have been too high for him to be so careless. Yet the beatings have only gotten worse with each pack he’s sent me off to. Combine denying me my medication with the hardship of hiding my injuries and he’s making it easier for them to discover the abuse I’m suffering much sooner. I’m certain that this alpha has already figured out that I’m being abused and I’ve barely been here an hour. It’s be clear to me that he’s using the warrior program as a new way to abuse me. I can’t think of how many times he’s told me that I’m too weak for any alpha to ept into a second run and it seems like every time Ie back I have to deal with the council poking around. He will refrain from abusing me while they’re there but the moment they leave I’m chained up and beaten three to four times a week until he decides to send me on another run. So it’s not difficult for me to go pack when my dad tells me to, that I’m going to whatever pack he decides is next for me in the line up. I need to get away from him just as badly as he hates seeing my face in his territory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step inside the room several feet,pletely neglecting to even search for the light. It’s as I ce the pack I’m wearing on the bed that I’m startled by the light being flipped on. I turn quickly to see that Alpha and his son have stepped inside the room with me. The alpha gives me a smile but says nothing. It seems he’s started observing again. I turn and start moving slowly around the room taking in everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Would it be okay if I put your wet clothes in the washer?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Damian asks, causing me to freeze and look at him. He lets out a nervous chuckle as I study him with my head cocked to one side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It seems like you haven’t been met with much kindness.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a slight hum as I run my hand nervously over the left side of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Not from alphas.” I speak quietly. “Yes. I would appreciate that. You said you stock soap and other stuff like that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, I’ll show you where it’s at once you’ve explored a bit.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as Alpha Damian makes his way over to arge closet at the back corner of the room. I watch him open it up revealing a full size washer and dryer stacked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to run this through a quick rinse cycle before you do a full wash.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod again with a quiet thanks. Exploring therge room has taken my mind off the events that had just happened and it seems like the alpha has picked up on my calmed demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, it’s very important that you tell me the truth. I promise you nothing you tell me will result in you being removed from my first run. The only things that I will remove you for is if you steal, fight, rape, take recreational drugs or drink until you’re stupid. I don’t tolerate any of those things. So, are you usually on medication for your anxiety?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freeze in the doorway of the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak quietly, ashamed to admit that I have an issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not something to be ashamed of but it’s important that I know what you’re on and the dosage.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head slowly before I speak again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve been on several differentbinations of medications over thest several years. Dr. Carter tends to change thebination every time my dad forces me off of them, trying to figure out thebination with the least amount of side effects. Thest set of three with either Xanax or Valium to help me at night on the really rough days I did really well on. Minimal side effectspared to otherbinations and I wasn’t a zombie or felt like I was drugged. I was actually close to….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts wander off track as I walk around the rest of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You felt close to normal?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha finishes for me. I nod my head in agreement as we continue to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How long have you been off of it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Three, almost four months. My dad has been getting more persistent at blocking all my efforts to get to it while I’m home.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He doesn’t want you on medication?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. He says taking medication is an admittance to weakness and he refuses to tolerate any shows of weakness from his son.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you know what you were taking?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh as I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you able to find phone numbers of doctors at different hospitals?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time it’s the alpha looking at me with a cocked head. I can’t help but return the curious look while waiting for his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I should have enough connections to dig up a doctor. Do you have a name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Carter. Dr. Alexander Carter at Red General. He’ll likely rmend a differentbination as the biggest trouble I seem to have is eating while on them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a smile and a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Will you tell me why you’re on this medication?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asks slowly the one question I don’t want to answer. I shake my head slowly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Alpha, I can’t. I don’t expect you to understand but I can’t. I just can’t.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t think you would. Trust is an easy thing to lose but hard to gain. Hopefully, in time, you’ll be able to see me for who I am and change your mind. My door is always open.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head in silent thanks waiting for the next thing toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s gettingte so how about we get you out here to the table of food. Take all you want as you have arger apartment sized fridge in here you can store food and drinks in. We have bags of ice in the dining hall by the main pack house. You can grab one at dinner tomorrow and bring it back. We also have disposable cups, tes and stic utensils you can bring back too. Cleaning supplies are in the walk-in closet next to the stairs. Personal necessities are in the walk-in closet on the opposite side. Don’t hesitate to grab what you need. If there is something specific that you need let me or one of the trainers know and we’ll try to get it for you. Damian and Dominic will be here at seven to lead everyone over to the pack house for breakfast. They will do this everyday this week then you’ll be on your own. Expectation is that you are showered and ready to start training when you get there although when this ce gets full I do have some prospects who choose to switch to evening showers over morning. I’lle get you at breakfast so get your food, take your time eating, when you’re done you’re going to meet with me in my office. I’m going to have my lead doctor in the medical wing join us with the phone call to Dr. Carter. I’m putting you back on your meds while you’re here. There’s no reason for you to suffer like this.”</p>
