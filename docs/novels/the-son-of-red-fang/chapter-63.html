                <p>Ang smiles as she agrees with my observation. “If I can’t touch the bruise to determine sensitivity and potential fracture then I need to do an x– ray  .  *</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you can get the x–ray without moving him then that’s what we need. Otherwise it can wait until I do his physical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re going to do it personally, privately?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. If we’ve gotten him out of the cycle then I should be able to move him up stairs after dinner tomorrow. He needs to be up, walking around before I can move him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I state as I tie his gown back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Even though he seems asleep I’m going to distract him as you give those shots. Enough time has passed for us to get back   to Jamie. He should be fairly numb by now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods in agreement as she picks the syringes up off the bed as she sits behind his back. I take the stool next to Jamie, who’s practically sleeping himself. and run my hand through Cole’s hair. To my surprise, he opens his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t think you werepletely asleep. Are you upset that I looked at your rear without asking?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shakes his head as he whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, only…. a matter… of time….. before…. you saw.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Ang is going to give you those shots she talked about. Stay rxed. You won’t feel much.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he closes his eyes again. I slide my hand into his. It’s faint and slow but I can feel the steady rhythm of his hand gently squeezing mine as Ang cleans his arm with alcohol before wiping the same area down with the lidocaine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Would you like me to count before the stick?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He makes the thumb down sign with his free hand before taking a deep breath. He still has a decent wheeze going on but I smile at  how  deep he  was  able to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Ang. Just go ahead with them while he’s still rxed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flinches slightly with the first stick but was practically asleep with the second. It’s as Jamison and I get up that Cole grabs Jamie’s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t think…. it will do…. much…. but you can… tell what…. little you’ve seen.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There’s a look of shock on Jamie’s face as we walk back to the bed to take care of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie stays quiet as we approach the bed. I can tell by his numbers that Cole fell asleep during the short walk from one side of the room to the other. I’m grateful that he’s finally rxed enough with us that he’s finally able to rest. Hopefully we can leave him be for a solid two hours without having to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>introduce something new to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Go ahead and kick your shoes off. This is going to take a while, that’s why you’re getting thefy bed. If you don’t mind, I’d like to ask some questions about what went on in the dining hall with Das.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamison shrugs his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t mind. I have nothing to lose ,  right?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t like sending prospects home early, especially when you’ve barely been here a day. Being honest with me will make the process of figuring out who started the fight a whole lot easier. So I would say nothing to lose but something to gain.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I thought you automatically went home for fighting? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Council rules for prospects dictate that assault at any time while you’re outside your own territory is grounds for dismissal but ,  they say nothing about selt</p>

                <p>“So you found a loophole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ang has started with the deepestyer of stitching causing Jamison to startle. I can tell by his eyes that he’s ufortable with what he feels going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamie,” I try to call him back to me. When he makes  eye  contact I smile gently trying to rea downpletely.”</p>

                <p>“I’m sorry, Jamison. These deep cuts can be quite tricky to getpletely numb. Hold still. I’m going to hit a few more ces.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezes my hands hard as she injects lidocaine into several more  spots , rxing slowly as she hits areas that have numbed nicely.</p>
