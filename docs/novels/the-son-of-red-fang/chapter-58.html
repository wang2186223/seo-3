                <p>I’ming out of the link as Demetri walks into the room and Ang has started oninfore fase Demetri walks drai  to  este, pár back and leaning over the young man as he runs his hand through his hair. I look back to Ile Pierce and Jamte and notes that he’s working Dem interaction with Cole quite intensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden yelp from Jamie startles me but it’s Cole’s reaction that catches the attention of all of us. Not only does Cole startle put be priced? Was energy than he’s had all day, stopping Demetri in his tracks. Demetri cocks his head to one side as he listens to Cale before foeming atmod and heading back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang, hold your exam for a minute.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s already done. He’s bruised up decently. Nothing his wolf can’t handle in a day or two but theceration above his my he’s drawn to the home and is approximately an inch and a half which is why I rmend stitches.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demetri has leaned over Cole again speaking to him. It doesn’t take long for Cole’s growling to slowly diminish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can I talk to him, Alpha?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He does seem to know you. He’s even protective of you. You cane over for a minute. It will reassure him of what we’re doing when we start doing the lidocaine shots to numb that cut over your eye.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shots?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamison sounds nervous about the shots, but then again it does hurt to have a needle poking around a fresh wound. He slides off  the  table and walks quietly over to Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(Demetri’s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step into Cole’s room quietly. I’m not too happy with Patrick when I told him to get with Kathy over Ang but I’ll deal  with  thatter. I nce over at the table that the young man is perched on. He’s the pr opposite of Cole. Easily moving through the minor exam with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately walk over to Cole. My intentions with the abused wolf hasn’t changed much despite the disturbing rumors that he has raped his future luna or that he’s raping little kids. I’m finding it difficult to believe that a wolf who’s shown me a gentleness that no wolf ,  outside my own children, has shown me during this extremely vulnerable time would be capable of such violence. The harshness of these rumors are beginning to make me think of family scapegoat abuse. Only it seems to have bled over into most of his pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slip one hand into his while I gently run my other hand through his hair trying to wake him as gently as  I  can. He startles badly despite my efforts. Gasping hard as he bes aware of my presence, he squeezes my hand hard as I feel his body begin to shake .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey Cole, what’s going on? I haven’t felt you shake like this since this morning.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opens his mouth but closes it without saying anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx with me Cole. I’m going to check on this nebulizer. If it’s done I’ll change you to just oxygen .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk away to where the nebulizer is hooked up and turn it off when  I  see the medication is gone. I switch the oxygen over to the cann and walk back over to Cole. He’s already trying to get the mask off but seems to be getting frustrated with his struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Easy there Cole. I got you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently ce a hand upon his to calm his struggles with the mask before gently pulling it off  of  him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank… you”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He speaks breathlessly. He opens his  eyes  and watches my movements as I ce the  oxygen  cann under his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you doing okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He  nods his head slowly before pointing subtly towards Jamison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you okay with him being here?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Will … you…. let… we…. see him? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ You know him? Is he a friend?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m shocked that he was telling me the truth about his concerns for Cole. He gives me a thumbs up confirming my questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, let me go check on how far Ang is on her exam of him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I turn around a head towards the other young man I startle when he yelps. I pause my movements even longer when I hear a quiet persistent growl emanating from the young man behind me. I immediately turn and make my way back to Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re protective of him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I state in a shocked whisper that he had found someone in the pack worth protecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t….. hurt…. him…. He’s ….  more…. brother….. then…. my….. family.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not purposeful Cole. Ang is examining him because he ended up in a nasty fight and it looks like he’s going to need stitches. Rx, okay. FII let hime talk to you in a minute .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand briefly and look towards Jamison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can I talk to him, Alpha?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He does seem to know you. He’s even protective of you. You cane over for a minute. It will reassure him of what  we’re  doing when  we  start doing the lidocaine shots to numb that cut over your eye.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shots? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamison sounds nervous as he slides off the table and walks over to Cole.</p>
