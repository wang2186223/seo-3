                <p>She  takes the pills and the water as she looks at my still hard soldier standing at attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you think he raped me Demetri?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asks quietly as she swallows the two pills down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Based on what you remember feeling and the standard way that sex training is used, I would find it difficult to believe that you weren’t. I have always believed that you had it worse than you let on. That’s why I’ve always moved so slowly with you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you think you know what he did to me when I was in heat? That you can duplicate it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have a bad feeling that I know the difference you’re looking for.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as I look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Will your experiment answer if he raped me or not?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I believe it will if you really need to know.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to know Demetri. I need to know what thatst thing was he put in me before you took me away.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s going to hurt you, Lilly.” I whisper desperately hoping she will change her mind. “You have already told me so much that I didn’t know and it exins so many things we struggle with. I don’t understand why thisst thing is so important.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t expect you to understand, Demetri. But if you think you know what thatst thing was and if thatst thing was rape then I need to know. I need to feel and confirm what happened to me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look into her eyes and see the sincerity, the need for this horrid answer. I finally nod my head before wrapping my arms around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please do this for me, Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a deep breath before ultimately agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It won’t be exactly the same as I refuse to hurt you with what I think he did but I will give you enough for you to figure it out. I have entered you from behind before but I’m going to change one thing about it since you said that you haven’t felt the same thing sinceing here. I’ll exin what it is I’ve changed after you figure out if it’s the same feeling as back then. No matter how gentle I do this, entering you from behind right now is going to hurt but it’s the only way to figure out if that’s the way he was raping you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods as she gingerly starts moving around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get into the position you remember being in back when it happened to you. I’m going to use the bathroom first.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods with a stoic face as I walk to the bathroom. I don’t want to do this and what little psychological training I had as a doctor instinctually tells me this is a bad idea but I feel I know the answer she’s looking for. Question is will it bring her any closer to the closure she has denied herself for over twenty years. Will this answer be what she needs to finally start processing what happened to her? Will this finally allow her to ept the truths that I give her versus the half truths and straight lies he fed her to make herply?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>never used on</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts are racing as I open my bathroom cab with the door to the bathroom shut. I don’t want to give her  any  clues as to my current thoughts on what he did even though it sounds like he came into the room already wearing it. I easily find the one thing I Lilly but started stocking in my cab recently since both my sons are old enough to have sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull out the box from the cab and open it up, removing one of the little square packs from inside. It’s been over twenty years  since   I’ve  put a condom on but that is the one thing I adamantly refused to use when I was with Lilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She   is  my mate, there was never any reason to. I open it quickly and  give   my  thickness  a   few  quick hard rubs before  rolling   it   on  .   Female</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wolves are extremely sensitive to touch, especially during sex so it would not surprise me in the least if such a simple  thing  as a condom wouldpletely change the way I feel inside her. The question that remains is if this will make me feel like whatever it was her father was  putting  inside her thosest two years she was with him.</p>
