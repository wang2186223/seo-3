                <p>So we made it through the bath. He did all three of them in the tub at the same time. He washed Jerry first before pulling him out ,   putting  him in towel and handing him to me with just a diaper on. I held him while he coached the girls on how to wash but it became very clear that Caitlyn  was   very  inefficient and Brittany was unable. I could see his hands shaking when he put the soap on the cloth to wash them. I guess he was hoping he wouldn’t have to touch them. He was very quiet and obviously ufortable while he worked with them. The only things that he said  were   simple bmands to get them the way he needed as quickly as possible. I don’t know what gave me the impression but I swear he wanted to cry while bathing them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ He  was that afraid of bathing them?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie starts nodding his head. “Of touching them while they were naked. Yes, I think so. They picked up on it too. Both of them tried tofort  him   but  he refused them. They ended up crying when he got angry with them. He felt bad but he just wanted to get them done. He got them dressed and we watched the show we always watch before their 8pm bedtime. The girls had been getting antsy all night and simply didn’t want to sleep without knowing what happened to mom and dad. Even Jerry was unusually difficult to put down. He ended up putting a bunch of nkets on the floor of the girls ‘  room  and bid on the floor with Jerry .  I don’t think he meant to fall asleep but he did so I cleaned up the kitchen and bathroom before going to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was midnight when mom and dad both woke me asking what he did to the kids. I was still asleep and very confused by the question .   I  got mad at them. Asked them what did they mean, what did he do? He took care of them. He cooked dinner, gave them a bath, and watched their favorite show  before  putting them to bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole woke up as soon as dad took Jerry and gave him to mom. They went to the room we  gave  to Cole while mom put Jerry in his crib. We both went back to Cole’s room and stood outside the door. I don’t remember the entire conversation but what I do remember I don’t think I could ever forget.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ What happened?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I remember dad sounding concerned. When mom and I got to just outside the door Cole was in a panic attack. We could hear it in  his  voice. He kept telling dad that he needed to take his belt off and beat him. Cole was begging dad to beat him and dad didn’t understand why. Every time Cole said that  he   needed  to be beat my dad asked why. Cole repeatedly said that he saw the kids naked. That he touched them. Dad asked in what  way  did he touch them  and  Cole told him that he washed them because they didn’t know how to. Dad tried so hard to convince him that washing them was an eptable form of touch  since  they couldn’t quite do it yet but the begging continued anyway. Dad kept repeating why until Cole finally yelled at him. His voice was frustrated and desperate for dad to understand. He yelled “because  I  can’t handle another beating from my father. If you think I did something wrong then you need  to  beat me for it. It doesn’t matter if I actually did it. Just please don’t tell my dad. I’ll strip down naked,y on the bed and you put as much strength as you have into that belt around your waist. I won’t yelp or scream. I won’t wake the kids. Please just don’t tell dad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was hysterical, crying uncontrobly and wheezing badly. Mom and I didn’t look into the room until dad told him to strip down. Mom was going to intervene but stopped suddenly. I guess dad linked her. Cole was too panicked to see us standing in the doorway .  It was very painful for him to strip himself of his clothes and dad had to stop him fromying down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your dad beat him standing up?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can see tears forming in Jamie’s eyes as he continues. Shaking his head he starts again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. Dad didn’t beat him at all but for some reason acting like he  was  going to calmed Cole briefly. Dad was very gentle with his voice when talking to Cole once he was naked. The same marks that are on his chest now are the same as the ones we saw on his back, rear and the back of his thighs. Dad tried to count the number of strikes but they were so crisscrossed together that he couldn’t. He fought with dad when he was told to turn around. I nearly threw  up  when he finally did. His chest ,  the front of his thighs, even his privates were torn up badly. Mom was the one that held me and kept me from losing my dinner. I couldn’t look at him anymore after that.”</p>
