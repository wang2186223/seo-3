                <p>I’m running fast through the forest easily dodging the tree roots and low hanging branches. My solid ck wolf dips in and out of the shadows easily wh only his bright gold eyes giving away his very presence. The moon is full and high in the sky giving me the best lighting for such a venture betare night dinner with my beta, his son, my two sons, my luna and Alpha Dominic and his new luna, Dasha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had Lilly take our daughters, twins Madisyn and Madilyn to the pack’s banquet hall for dinner while I had my phone conference with Xwer, the lead liaison with the council for abused and tortured wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My meeting didn’t give me the answers I was looking for, thus the reason for my run right now. I’m angry and frustrated with the condition Cole is in. He’s in no condition for his strength and endurance to be tested. All 1 can do right now is challenge his character, to figure out his personality and core values. Although, I do have an uneasy feeling that if he hadn’t had that asthma attackst night he’d be pushing himself to keep up with the rest of the warriors. much to his own detriment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scheduled my dinner for eight, giving me enough time to give Jamie a short visit with Cole before returning him to the prospects dormitories about ten minutes ago. That’s where my run started. I needed to clear my head, make a n. Not only am I dealing with trying to poll Cole from his pack out  the  probable relocation of Jamison Williams and his family. He and his father, Jonathan Jenkins, know too much to consider leaving them   at Red Fang should I find a  way  to make a move on Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop at the far south western edge of my territory. I take my time smelling the air as I slowly cross the line into a clearing just beyond the tree line. The faint smell of rotting meat and wet dog alerts me to rogues having been in the area but the faintness of it reassures me that it’s been days since they werest here. It’s been a while since I’ve crossed my own border as a wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m on high alert as I explore the area. It looks as if it was cleared and being prepared for housing but  was  abandoned before anything else happened. I continue my cautious walk for about a mile beforeing across a stream. I stop briefly for a drink. Thisnd is providing me a decent distraction for the moment and I’m deep in thought as to the uses thisnd could provide my pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I have the Blue Ridge territory that borders mine on the southeast corner but I haven’t heard of anynd deals going on since Alpha Hunter  and  Luna Melissa Blue had attempted to expand their territory. Unfortunately a rogue attack decimated the pack and killed both of them causing the contract to be canceled. Alpha Hunter’s beta, Alrik Anderson then took over the pack since the Blue’s twin daughters ,  Savannah and Samantha, couldn’t be found. They were only a year, maybe two when the attack happened fourteen years ago. It was about two years ago that I met with an extremely stubborn delta he–wolf. If my son hadn’t picked up on Delta Jacob’s refusal to fight he would have killed him the night he crossed our border.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s the stirring of the leaves that brings me from my thoughts, alerting me to the presence of another. I lift my head just enough from the water to smell the air. I can just barely catch her scent but it tells me everything I need to know. It’s obviously another werewolf. She’s not a lost member of Crimson Dawn but she doesn’t smell like a rogue either. It’s a young she–wolf that is terrified by my very presence even though I’ve yet to even spot her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lift my head slowly, scanning the other side of the stream, straining against the darkness of the tree line looking for who I know  I  smell. It takes me a minute to finally spot her. Standing on the edge of the forest is a light colored she–wolf. She’s too small to be an adult and she’s obviously malnourished which likely forced her to shift before she turned sixteen. She’s frozen, where she stands with several dead hares hanging from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I start to shift I’m stopped by a quiet, submissive voice in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Please don’t shift. I know what you are and I can channel with you‘</p>
