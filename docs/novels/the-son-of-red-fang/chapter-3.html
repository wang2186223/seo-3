                <p>“Since it’ste and I’m certain you’re all tired from such a long trip, I will save the majority of the details of our rules and expectations for Monday’s orientation. All prospects are given the same general introduction to our pack before they get off the bus. The time and location of the orientation meeting will be announced Friday evening once we are certain that all five buses have arrived. I believe that my father will be running three different meetings due to therger than normal response to this run. My father will be the primary speaker but myself, Alpha Dominic, Alpha Lucas, Beta Patrick and Beta Parker will also be there to cover anything that my father misses as well as to answer any questions you may have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of us will have some involvement with you during your training here at Crimson Dawn. As I am certain you have already heard, we are a strict and when needed, unforgiving pack and we do implement physical punishment in ordance with councilws.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you are caught in the act of raping or assaulting anyone; male or female, a member of your pack or a non-pack member, be prepared to present your bare ass to my father in his office where he has a leather belt waiting with your name on it. The penalty for rape or assault starts at ten full strength hits but he is allowed up to half your age. I can assure you from personal experience you will not sitfortably for a few days afterwards. For those of you who can’t do math, and you will be tested on your level of education, that means if you’re twenty-four years old you can receive up to twelve full strength hits to your bare skin before you are sent home and a report filed with the council. Odd numbered ages receive the lower amount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We also have a zero tolerance policy for fighting, stealing, unauthorized drug use, and alcohol abuse. Only prescription drugs that we are notified of this week before your physical or those disclosed in your prospect application will be tolerated. If you test positive for any drug that you have not disclosed to us or drugs that are purely recreational in nature, you will be sent home and a report filed with the council.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stealing and fighting that is not directly witnessed by a credible source will be penalized until an investigation ispleted. If the investigation shows that you stole something you will be sent home and a report filed. Fighting is the same as assault. The only difference is if we don’t witness who started it all parties involved will receive the same penalty until we find out who did. The aggressor of the fight will be sent home and a report filed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For those of you who are twenty-one or older, limited alcohol consumption is allowed on Friday and Saturday nights. However, we will not tolerate anyone getting shitfaced drunk. This is the only intolerance that we have a three strikes rule on. Your first offense will earn you a fullp around the fifty mile perimeter of our territory, second offense is a week on house arrest and your third offense will get you sent home and reported to the council. We expect you to know your limit or don’t drink at all. Underaged drinking will get you sent home on the first offense and don’t try to lie. It takes less than ten minutes to verify your age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both blood and urine will be collected during next week’s physical. We will be testing for everything. Drugs, sexually transmitted infections, nutritional deficiencies and organ enzyme levels just to name a few. It is important to keep in mind that random urinalysis for drugs is permitted so do not think that you’re going to stop using just long enough to get through the initial drug screen then you can start again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are already arge packpared to most of those bringing prospects in so our standards have been set high for prospects to be invited to a second run. Only thirty wolves from all three runs will get invited back for the second run and our expectations are even higher during that run for you to get offered a position here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If you have not disclosed to the council prescription medication that you are on or if you have recently been ced on long term medication, you need to request a private meeting with my father. Bring with you all medications that you are on so he can record the type, dosage and doctor that has prescribed it. Also be prepared to discuss why you are on the medication. It is important that you disclose this information so that we can maintain you on the medication you have already been prescribed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of you are warrior prospects, training while you are here is your job. You will be tested mentally and physically so we can put you into groups appropriate for your skill level. You will have physical training, eight hours a day in various disciplines Monday thru Thursday and you will have a mix, four hours of physical training and four hours in the ssroom, on Friday. Training happens mostly outdoors no matter the weather so dress inyers appropriately. Saturday and Sunday are your days off which is why we will allow light drinking on Friday and Saturday nights as there is to be no alcohol in your system when you report to training on Monday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic and I will be giving you your room assignment before you leave the bus to collect your belongings. There are twenty rooms per floor, ten on the east side and ten on the west, so four of you will be randomly assigned rooms on the second floor. No one will be bunking together. Each room is an efficiency apartmentplete with a full bath, small apartment sized refrigerator and medium sized microwave. First floor apartments have a stacked washer and dryer while the second and third floor ones have argeundry room located on the southern end of the building. When using themunalundry room you are expected to know what is yours. Taking someone else’s clothing is stealing and will not be tolerated. Forcing your way into another wolf’s room also will not be tolerated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each floor has two closets that you can get everyday supplies from. There are two sets of stairs. One on the east side of the building the other is on the west. Both are on the north end. The closet containing basic cleaning supplies and a variety ofundry detergents and conditioners is located in the room in front of the eastern stairs. The room on the western side contains personal hygiene products as well as bottled water and shelf stable food and snacks that you can take back to your room. The closets are stocked every Saturday and once again, please be adults and do not hoard items from the closets. There will be a total of sixty wolves living in this building by Wednesday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second and third floor recreational areas have a television. Second floor has an xbox hooked up to it, the third floor has a PS4. Failure to share the game systems will result in the games being taken away. We took them away during thest run we had so don’t think that it won’t happen as it will. Air hockey and foosball tables are on the second floor and a full size pool table is on the third.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You are all adults and we expect you to act that way. With that being said, disagreements happen, especially when multiple packs are housed together. However, fist fighting is assault and will not be tolerated. If fist fighting is the only way you feel a disagreement can be settled then you are to report it. Your best contacts are going to be myself, Dominic, Lucas, Patrick, or Parker. You can take the matter straight to my dad if you feel the need, he has an open door policy. You will not be penalized for anything you bring to us. If by the time you make the report you still want to fight, then we will arrange a sparring match for the next day. A controlled one on one fight, without shifting, until one party submits with no major injuries. As I said earlier, assault will earn you a one way ticket out of our territory.”</p>
