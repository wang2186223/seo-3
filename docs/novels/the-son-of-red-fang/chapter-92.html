                <p>“ What a shame. That’s quite a bit to be dealing with.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There’s more Xavier.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ More?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It was around 1:30 when I discovered arge scar on the bottom half of his back but I can’t tell what caused it because of all the cuts and bruises on  his  back. He has a nasty, scabbed up ck bruise along his ribs that X–rays have revealed contains two cracked ribs. If you look closely you  can  see with some of the stray hits that the bruise is in the shape of a belt buckle. His rear and the backs of both thighs have the same marks. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I send Xavier the pictures of his back, rear and legs as I pause to let him collect his thoughts. I hear him sight deeply before 1 continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It was after talking with his friend and what his friend witnessed, at least the aftermath portion of alpha’s abuse, that I discovered the most disturbing injuries.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re not done yet.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I haven’t even found everything out about this young man. This is all about what happened three days ago.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s got a severely bruised abdomen, cuts and bruises all over his chest, back, butt and thighs and two broken ribs. What else is there to beat on?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“His groin.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak softly as I wish it wasn’t true. As angry as pedophiles make me I still would kill them quickly over trying to beat their dick off. That’s just  as  sick and depraved as anything a pedophile could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you certain that this is simply an usation? That he wasn’t caught in the act?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Even if he was caught in the act of raping his luna, would the council approve of this as appropriate physical punishment? I haven’t even sent you the  rest  of the pictures.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How many more do you have?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not certain. I only took one of his groin as he’s so swollen and discolored it’s difficult to tell he’s even a male. I took two of his left leg where he has both marks from the belt and a severe second degree chemical burn.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wait, what was that you just said?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He doesn’t know what his father did to burn his leg. He tends to close his eyes when his father chains him. All he could tell me was that something  was  wrapped tightly around his leg just after his father chained him. He didn’t say anything about it being hot, just that it burned badly. That’s actually a major concern of ours right now. We put him in a twilight sleep to do a debridement surgery on his leg. When Ang took a fluid sample she found that it  was  already badly infected. We reversed the twilight sleep over two hours ago and he hasn’t woken up yet. We’ve already maxed him out for today on the reversal drug so we’re keeping a tight watch on him until morning. I’ve got an alpha nurse that normally works the night shift at Generaling to keep an  eye  on him overnight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What else did you find?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There’s bruises on his wrists where he broke the chain, and cuts and bruises on his forearms and shins. After he broke the chain his dad got careless with the belt. There’s a bruise in the shape of a handprint on the back of his neck.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Send everything you have. I will request a special meeting with the council tomorrow to discuss applicablews that pertain to a situation like this but it can take up to a  week  just to get a date and it may be a month or longer before  I  can meet with them. They don’t have a very good prioritization system which seems to allow dangerous situations like this slip through the  cracks . My best advice is to get him talking and agree to the protection orders. If he was willing to give you detailed ounts of the beatings he’s receiving at home I’m certain ne’d fit into protection from abuse and protection from torture orders . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you. Keep me updated on what’s going on and I’ll do the same from here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll try my best, Demetri. Have a good evening.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hang up with Xavier shortly before going through my pictures and sending thest of them. I find myself stuck on the hand print around his per big as my  own  hand. I can’t help but imagine that nasty bruise wrapped around my girls‘ necks. How much pain that would cause them. There’s plenty of times that my submission hold has caused pain but that’s usually only when the adults struggle toply with my demand or they are actively burting someone else. Never have I left a bruise like this on the neck of a pack member. Xavier is right, no wonder he had such a dramatic reacting to permal submission hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m deep in thought as I didn’t expect Xavier’s reaction to what I gave him nor the fact that getting a meeting with the council is no longer an easy or fast thing.  I’ve  got to get this young wolf to talk. To agree to the protection orders or I fear that Jamison may be right. Alpha Redmen may indeed kill his youngest son .</p>
