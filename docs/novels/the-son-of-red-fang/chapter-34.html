                <p>I know what I want to do. I’ve yed it over in my head many times but that doesn’t make it any easier to do. It’s been hard to show my love to my luna, to show her my wants and desires for her heart, body and soul. The moon goddess paired me with a beautifully made  luna   who  was traumatized by her father for years after her mother passed. She was the only girl and the youngest of four. To this day I don’t know the specifics of what happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’mying on top of her, still between her legs supporting myself on my arms that I’ve tucked beneath her. She’s closed her eyes as she’s  trying  to gain control of her emotions. It’s been years since I’ve demanded control, that I was going to challenge everything that she fears,  I’ve   only  done it twice before now. Both times she was in heat, first when she was ready for our second pup and the second was five years ago when she wanted to try for our third, we got twins instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have found over the years that she has topletely submit to me in order for her to handle the tie. This means I have to haveplete control because the tie starts urring before I’m done ejacting. I’ve gotten used to pulling out and finishing myself outside of her over the years as it’s been a rare but beautiful urrence for her to orgasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I allow her to use her hands or mouth, whatever she’sfortable with at the moment, to finish my release. Considering the panic the tie creates, that to this day she struggles to get past, it’s the least  I  can do for afortable sexual life with her. Most wolves do in a day what we manage to do in a month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s as her body starts to rx beneath me that I have my n and start easy on her again. We have both cooled down sexually speaking so getting the arousal back for both of us is my first step. I duck my head down beside hers ,  allowing my wolf to purr softly near her ear. She immediately responds with a purr rxing her body even more beneath me.  I  start with my gentle kisses, sensual and sweet, from her temple to her mark earning me a quiet moan as I barely graze my extended canines over her mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m relieved when she joins in, using her hands to gently guide me back to her mouth. I’m always nervous when I demand submission from my luna. As my mate she is an equal to me even if she’s notfortable exercising that dominance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’ve always hated demanding submission from her but I have found it a necessary evil when she panics ,  when any of them panic. I nip her bottom lip, slipping my tongue inside when she gasps, greedily wrestling her tongue for dominance as I feel her stifling her giggles. Such a simple feeling rxes me, allowing my mind to get away from the nagging dread I’ve felt most the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my mouth down her body until I reach her breasts again. I grab one in my hand, gently massaging the supple mound, barely grazing her nipple with my thumb. I’m getting her started with the simple things that she’s gottenfortable with me doing over the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her challenge tonight, outside of her usual, is my desire to taste her. She’s putty in my hand as I flick the other nipple with my tongue before drawing it gently into my mouth. Ibine the use of my tongue with the gentle suction from my mouth to make her breathing rise faster and her body squirm. Our lock into each other through the link allows me to feel what she physically feels, reassuring me that her squeals and squirm are in pure enjoyment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I switch to the other breastmitting myself to giving her the same enjoyment for the same amount of time. My soldier is rock hard and ready for a piece of the action. Although it took over a year after Damian was born to touch her this way, I was able to get her to enjoy it. The same can’t be said for anything further south.</p>
