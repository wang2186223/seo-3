                <p>“ After he was kicked over a dozen times he was forced to his feet and his hands tied behind his back before he was led to the training room.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry to interrupt Demetri but let’s start from the beginning with you and I’d like</p>

                <p>“That’s fine, I agree with the recording.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, how did you end up with him in your medical wing? If he’s not willing to talk then obviously he didn’t run up to you begging for your help    stripping  his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clothes off.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, to start at the very beginning. Damian noticed that he was extremely submissive and highly anxious before he even got off the busst night. By the time he got off the bus one or more of his pack mates had gotten a hold of his belongings and threw them into a smallke that forms when it rains for several days. Mild verbal abuse started after he had an extreme fight or flight reaction to me touching him. I separated him from his pack and helped him to his room where he admitted that he takes medication for the anxiety but his father actively keeps him from being able to ess it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Denial of proper medical care is problematic, especially when sending a prospect to another pack. The alpha of every pack participating knows that the prospect needs to be in top physical and mental condition so denying medication to someone who needs it is, indeed, a big problem.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“His anxiety was high enoughst night that I wanted to give him my number so he could contact me if an issue came up but I neglected to ask if he had a phone on him. He hasn’t been able to tell me what happened but Damian found him in a massive asthma attack around seven this morning. He was berely able to talk but was able tomunicate that he went into a panic induced asthma attack around midnight. We reached out to the one doctor that is of high enough rank to override the pack alpha in regards to his  care  but his budget at the hospital is so low that his care is usually higher than the money he’s allowed to spend.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So what does this doctor do for him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He finds every short cut he can to preserve the money this individual is given. The doctor pays for his  asthma   and  anxiety medication so all he has to do is pick it up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But you said he’s not allowed to be on it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, but the doctor still fills it so that when he can get to the hospital he’s able to pick up several months of medication at that time. We have also discovered that this individual has been taught how to do his own stitches.“/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause a moment waiting for ament from Xavier but it seems he’s just as speechless as I was when I first found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The real killer in regards to the medical treatment he does receive is, that he’s absolutely terrified of the hospital. And with the budget as low as it tends to be, the short cuts that this doctor uses results in increasing his fear and anxiety.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What shortcuts are we talking about?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He has no support when he goes to the hospital and he has no ability to control his fear so as soon as he gets there he’s put into a full hard restraint system that doesn’t allow him to move. Him being restrained results in him being stripped of his clothing, a catheter put into his dder and a feeding tube ced through his nose into his stomach. He’s a hard stick when ites to doing an IV so they don’t. Instead they give him multiple IM injections of steroids and Valium until the crisis passes. When he goes into a cycle, like he did today, he’s usually in the hospital for at least a week. We’ve managed to start breaking up the cycle in about six hours but I still feel that’s too long.”</p>
