                <p>I unfold the gown and hold it up towards him. He slips his arms through the holes as I tie it behind his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Wrap your arms around me. On three I want you to stand with me. Then we will turn and I will line you up with the chair and have you sit. Ready? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods silently as we position ourselves for the move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Now 1… 2…  3  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He groans as he pushes up and I pull him back into a standing position. I can feel his legs trembling under his weight, likely from theck of oxygen he’s getting into his system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moves with me slowly as I get him lined up with the chair and get him sitting down in it.  Just  as he’s sitting down I hear Ang’s voiceing from down the hall. I let go of Cole and give Damian the instructions to stand behind him    as  I don’t like the way he’s struggling to hold his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unlock the brakes on the bed so I can get it out of the way  as  Ang instructs the omegas on where the bed goes.  I  smile at the site of my son with Cole His instincts on how to help others indiscriminately is kicking in well. He’s sitting behind Cole in a chair he’s adjusted high enough that he’s able to pull Cole back against the wheelchair and against his chest. He’s alsoid one arm down Cole’s chest encouraging him to lean against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only takes a moment to get the beds changed out but in that time  I  seemed to have lost track of Cole and Damian .   I’m  shocked but relieved when I find that Damian has moved Cole closer to the nebulizer hookup. Cole  is  still having a hard time epting even the soft mask for his treatments but I’m marveling at the patience  I  see from Damian towards this stranger on ournd. I look at Ang as the omegas set up the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ You said you were able to catch up with Dr. Carter again. What else were you able to find out? He’s been in here four hours and I’ve  seen  no change in his breathing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Yes, I had the chance to talk with him again. As I said earlier he said the reason for the catheter was because he couldn’t go when he was in the hospital. Apparently it was a position problem not a function problem. Which makes me wonder about the feeding tube. How necessary that really is. Him being restrained is an unfortunate mix of factors. Many nurses have seen him tear up the bed during the nightmares he has while sedated which has started a lot of nasty rumors at his home pack. He’s torn up multiple beds whiche out of his budget and he’s hurt himself on several asions. Most nurses refuse to work with him if he isn’t in a hard leather restraint system tying him to the bed. As he  gets  better, he gets stronger. Which is why they don’t let him out to eat or use the bathroom as it’s nearly impossible to get him restrained again. He has to be in really bad condition for him toe to the hospital as he ends up tied down from the time he gets there until about an hour before he leaves.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We need to change what is normally done during these attacks. The stress of being in the medical wing is enough to keep the cycle going but whatever nightmare he had when I walked in was quite nasty as well. Do we have any of the anti anxiety medication in a liquid form so we can get him started back on them? I don’t think he can handle pills right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve got his list and Alex is sending what has already been filled to us via fedex. They should be here in a day or two but I can get the pharmacy  to  fill what he’s currently on. I will look into any liquid versions that might  be  avable. Meanwhile, I’m going to double the nebulizer treatment and oxygen levels  he  gets in the mask but I’m cutting the Valium in half again. There’s  no  reason to have him at ten milligrams when he’s struggling to process  two  milligrams out of his body.”</p>
