                <p>I shift my weight from one arm to the other trying to determine how painful rolling the two of us to our sides would be for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, I don’t think the roll is going to feel good to you but I think, considering my tie tends to be on the long side, being on our sides for the long haul would be better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods her head silently. I know this is taking a bad toll on her when she gets quiet like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wrap your legs around my waist, your arms around my back under my arms.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She does as I’ve exined, grabbing my shirt tightly in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, baby. This is going to go fast. Do not bo</p>
                
                
                
                <p>back your pain. Let me know if it hurts.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods as she calms her breathing to better handle theing move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just hang on tight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel her grip tighten around me as I start rocking even harder side to side, the further to each side I go the stronger her whimpers get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alright baby, one…, two…, three…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrap one arm around her as I use my free arm and both legs to roll us to our sides. As hard as she tries to stifle her screams theye out anyway. Her pain and anxiety has herpletely exhausted and I’m grateful for herck of fight this time. I wrap her tight in my arms, soothing any desire to fight as I gently shift my hand to her face. I run my hand gingerly along her temple as she sobs against my chest. It’s as her sobs slow enough for her to speak that she starts again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was three and a half when mom and I went to theke together, Dad was in a real foul mood that day and was taking it out on my brothers. It was one of our favorite ces to go to get away from everything and everyone. I remember smelling a real foul smell, like rotting meat. When I asked about it, mom said it was just a rogue and that they were allowed to cross our territory’s boundary to get a drink from theke and hunt for food as long as they stayed in wolf form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she wasn’t worried, I wasn’t. We sat by theke for a while when a dirty, shaggy wolf appeared. He smelled awful but mom simply kept an eye on him as I yed with the frogs. Next thing I remember is him changing. I had never seen a grown man naked before but I was shocked to see the elephant between his legs. Even though I know now what it is I still can’t describe it as anything else. It was as he started running towards us that mom grabbed me and ran. She fell several times before she shoved me up a tree. She told me to climb down and run home for help once he followed her away from me. But I was too scared to figure out how to do either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried linking with dad but he kept saying he was in a meeting and blocking me out so I got my oldest brother Jacob, he was sixteen at the time. He dropped everything, locked his link and started looking for us. He was several miles away on the training grounds which was too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rogue attacked and raped mom before settling his sites on me. He had seen the tree mom left me in and I guess he knew I was too high because he came looking for me. He climbed the tree enough to shake the branch I was clinging to. I fell to the ground hard but managed to get up and run. I didn’t get far before he grabbed my leg, swung me around and cracked the middle of my back against a tree. I don’t remember</p>
                
                
                
                <p>much after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember the pain my back was in and him dragging me through the woods by my foot to where he left my mom. I was wearing a dress that got all torn while he dragged me on the ground so all he really had to do was take my underwear. I was screaming and crying when he spread my legs open and got on top of me but I didn’t understand what he was doing and I didn’t feel anything outside of the pain my back was in. He ended up hitting me several times with a rock to stop my screaming.</p>
