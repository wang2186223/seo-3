                <p>I give her a gentle smile and nod as she stands, giving me space to work with him, Damian has moved Jamie into a sitting position but has his hande gedly holding him just under his ribs. He’s swaying badly trying desperately to maintain his bnce even with Damian’s gentle hold from behind him. I grouch down in front of him, gently cing my hands under his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear his voice tremble as he whispers, the pain and fear from this attack weighing heavily on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes Jamie. We’re getting ready to move you downstairs where we have a gurney and ambnce waiting to take you to the medical wing. We’re going to he putting you in our multi scanner for x–rays, MRI and CAT scan. You’ve done extremely well submitting to our care so far. I need you to keep that up. Us moving you around is going to cause pain. It’s important that you don’t fight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch his mouth open and shut several times but nothinges out as he winces in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamie, talk to me. It’s okay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I encourage as he squeezes my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is it weak to be scared?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move my hand to his head and gently move it through his hair. He startles and yelps badly at my change in contact making me freeze my movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did that hurt you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask softly as I concentrate on softening my aura to something moreforting for his trip down to the first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir.” He whispers. “I’m scared and I don’t feel good. I’m tired, dizzy and feel like I’m going to hurl.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s a badbination, Jamie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s breathing hard through his mouth and I can tell that his ill feeling is more than that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Go grab a bucket from the bathroom.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand quickly, shooing Damian from behind him as I encourage Jamie to get into a kneeling position. I straddle Jamie’s body as  I  lean over top of him. Grabbing the bucket from Parker, I support his upper body with my arm and position him over the bucket just in time for his dinner to make a rapid exit from his body. I give him a minute to recover from his heaving as Jessa gently cleans his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you think you have any more?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask softly near his ear as I pet the top of his head. He shakes his head briefly before leaning hard into my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamie, I’m going to get Damian to help get you standing then I’m going to pick you up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t think I can, alpha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, get behind him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start picking up my pace as physically getting sick is a really bad sign for a significant concussion. Parker disposes of the bucket as Damian and I trade ces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ove my hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have Damian put him in a bear hug under his arms as I get mine under his rear. We lift together on three as Jamie yelps and cries from the pain. His adrenaline has worn off allowing him to feel the full fury of the beating that he’s suffered. We both hold him steady as his cries die do from his waist to his hands, cing them around my neck as I close the gap between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wrap your arms around my neck. When I pick you up I want your legs around my waist. Damian, your master key card also works the elevator. I need you to go ahead of me and open it up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put pressure on Jamie’s lower back encouraging him to step forward, allowing him to grab ahold of me with his hands. I crouch slightly, wrapping my hands around his thighs Counting to three again, I lift him with a growl from the floor. Damian has his hand on my back as I adjust to the additional weight, Parker is on the other side near Jamie. Years of training in field medicine and transport making it unnecessary to instruct them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you ready, dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I adjust my grip slightly on him before testing my bnce on my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, I’m good to start moving.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jessa has gone down ahead of us to grab the gurney from the ambnce. She’ll be waiting downstairs for us.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good to hear. Jamie.” I whisper near his ear. “If you can hear me, it would be best if youy your head on my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shoulder. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head control has gone south and it’s throwing me off bnce. Parker spots the issue quickly and guides the young man   into the crook of my neck. He’s whimpering softly and his entire body is shaking badly against mine as I make my way to the elevator.</p>
