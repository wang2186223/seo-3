                <p>(Content Warning)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>(8 year old Cole POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelp as I’m awakened by a sharp blow to the back of my neck. Before I can fully process what’s going on I receive a harsh p across my face. I grab the side of my face, gently rubbing away the sting as my eyes well up in tears. I yelp again as my mom starts yelling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you doing sleeping before dinner? There’s too much you need to get done before you go to bed and you know it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try to back away from her as she’s only inches from my face. Unfortunately this show of fear earns me another hard p across my face before she grabs me by the back of my neck and drags me out of my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Fuck! Not the submission hold. Anything but that.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think silently. But it is. She forces me to my feet as I try to fight against going to my father’s office, the ce of nightmares for me. My fight gets worse, crying and begging my mom not to leave me with him but as always my pleas fall upon deaf ears. She opens his door to find him on the phone. I get shoved harshly down into a chair, I know better than to run away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What has he done now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father asks with a sadistic smile on his face as he hangs up the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“His teacher called asking questions as to why he was sleeping instead of eating lunch and I caught him just now sleeping instead of doing homework.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try to reason with them even though I know it’s useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m allowed to sleep during lunch and my homework is done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Silence!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They yell in unison as I cringe farther back into the plush armchair. My eyes are quickly darting between the two of them as they discuss what the punishment will be for sleeping in school and before bedtime. The problem is, they’re in a link so as not to share the sadistic punishment I’m in store for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can tell by the darkening of my father’s eyes that he was going to take his frustration out on me which means this isn’t going to be a simple bare bottom belting. No, this was bound to be much worse and I can’t stop myself from shaking and whimpering in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mommy please don’t leave me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper as she walks by, tears again in my eyes. She doesn’t so much as nce my way giving me a nauseating feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, what had you up sote that you can’t stay awake in school?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is low, growling out every word as he walks toward the cab holding his favorite belt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy, please.” I whisper, “you know I was with you until elevenst night. I always go to bed at eight, nine at thetest.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You liar! You know no such thing happened! You were sent to bed and simply didn’t go! Put your arms straight out in front of you! Stand up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m whimpering badly as I try to stand but I’m shaking so bad that I fall the first time I try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Stand up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yells again, making me yelp in fear. I finally stand with my arms out in front of me and he doesn’t hesitate to bring the thick leather belt down hard across both my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How dare you lie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy, please. I wouldn’t.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelp as another crack of the beltnds across my hands. Fear gets the best of me and I pull my hands away as he swings a third time hitting the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You insolent little pup! Put your hands up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I raise my arms again, shaking uncontrobly as he brings the buckle side of the belt down upon my wrists. I jump back away from him as I cry out in pain bringing my hands to my chest infuriating him more. He swings the belt again only this time he strikes me at the back of my knees causing me to copse into his desk hitting the side of my head. I stay on all fours as my head spins from the hit and my vision is blurred from my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Get your ass up! Get your arms across the desk!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He yells, grabbing the back of my shirt and lifting me to my feet. He shoves me against the edge of the desk making me gasp. He grabs both my arms and stretches them harshly across the desk. I just barely gain my footing when the beltes down across my hands again. I scream as the heavy metal buckle hits my left wrist. He’s now hitting harder and faster than before, the metal buckle hitting the same spot on my wrist repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally get some sense back to me, I pull my arms back, cradling my left against my body. I can feel my wrist is already starting to swell from the brutal hits it’s receiving and the smell of blood from the cuts the buckle creates as it hits my tender skin. My cries are hysterical as I beg him to stop but there is never any stopping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabs my neck before reaching for my hands and pulling them out again. He shoves me harshly against the desk again as he ms my head into the hardwood. It’s as my head is spinning from another hard blow that he starts again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Repeatedly, the blowsnd across my wrists with the heavy bucklending hard in the same ce. A sudden pop in my wrist sends a wave of sharp pain through my arm resulting in my blood curdling scream echoing through the room. I copsed to the floor, screaming in pain as I know he’s broken my wrist for the second time this school year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re weak! This is nothingpared to battle! Get up and take your clothes off!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try to stand on legs that barely support me. My hands are swollen from the relentless hits and my left is worse than my right. It’s a struggle to undo the button on my jeans with my right hand, considering I’m left handed, and I know I’m not moving fast enough when I feel the bucklee down hard against my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I yelp in pain as I blindly fumble with the button on my jeans. It’s after the third hit to my neck that it finallyes free allowing me to take them off followed by my shirt and boxers. I’m shaking and crying uncontrobly, begging him to stop as I have no understanding as to why he’s being so brutal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabs my now naked body by the neck causing me to scream from the cuts and bruises left by the belt buckle as he forces me towards his desk. I struggle, yelp and scream for someone to help me but all it does it cause dad to m my head into the desk again. This time I’m choking on my own blood as it fills my mouth. Heys his body over mine, pinning me to the desk as he leans over the side to grab the leather straps he’s bolted to the underside of it. He stretches my swollen and battered arms out again, roughly tying them to the desk as I frantically scream in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I’m tied to the desk the beating and tirade of mental abuse starts again. I scream with every hit as the buckle digs into my back, butt and thighs. I can feel the blood as it slides down my legs causing me to squirm and kick desperate to rid myself of the disgusting, crawling feeling. But dad gets too close and ends up kicked in the thigh. A maniacalugh soones from his mouth as the beating with the belt stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So we want to kick now? I’ll give you something to kick at.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m panting hard trying to catch my breath as best I can when I feel him behind me. He grabs my thighs painfully hard as he lifts me off the floor spreading my legs unusually wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You get what you give, son.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds his knee makes a powerfully hard impact into my groin. I try to scream but I have no breath to scream with. Within seconds a second followed by a third and fourth hit to the same area urs leaving me unable to breathe let alone function. It’s only as mom speaks that I even know someone has entered the room but he doesn’t stop immediately upon her entrance. My delicate body parts have been smashed repeatedly into my intestines close to a dozen times by the time I hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Charles, what the hell? This isn’t what we agreed to. He’s already missed enough school for them to suspect something going on. You can’t keep getting carried away like this. He’ll be out at least a month after this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He kicked me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So. He’s chained to the fucking desk.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear him sigh and I can only hope that it’s finally over. He grabs me again, lifting me up part way. This time when he knees me in the groin not only does he smash my body parts into my intestines but just below my ribs hits the edge of the table. It’s when he does it a second time that I violently start vomiting all over his desk shortly before passing out from the excruciating pain.</p>
