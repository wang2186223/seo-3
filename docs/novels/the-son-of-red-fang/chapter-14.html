                <p>“Scrap that Ang, I need you to get a hold of Dr. Carter at Red General. I need to know how he treats Cole when he goes into a major panic</p>
                
                
                
                <p>induced asthma attack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When did that happen?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Around midnight. I should have given him my number. I’m bringing him into the medical wing, Kathy has already headed over to grab the chair but I need information on Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after hanging up the phone I can feel Alpha’s hand in my hair on the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, you can go inside and grab some breakfast. Don’t hesitate to addps to anyone who starts talking trash about anyone. Not just Cole. It’s important that we establish that I haven’t singled Cole out as a favorite getting special treatment.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.” Alpha Damian confirms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you going to be okay, Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*I…. hope</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I gasp out, trying to give him the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t talk Cole. Your lungs are severely restricted and I need you to concentrate on moving as much air as you can.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as there’s not much else I can do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll be with him in the medical wing most of the day so I’ll link you with any updates on him. You cane visit after training is over.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay dad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It shocks me how worried Alpha Damian sounds. Back home I usually have to drag myself the two miles from the pack house to the hospital in this desperate condition. I have one family that I’ve managed to be friends with but my abuse has affected them so badly that I was forced to abandon them, or at least I tried to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of my eye I can see the woman Alpha Demetfi called Kathying with a chair across thewn. Alpha seems to have seen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Stay still Cole. I’m going to move my position so I’m in front of you so that I can get you seated. If she brought some oxygen, then I will be putting that on you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod as I feel him move around me. Soon enough I feel the chair behind me and Alpha gently guiding me back towards it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve got hold of you. Start sitting down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grab hold of Alpha’s shirt tightly as he helps me into the chair. Going so long without breathing properly is really starting to get to me and it’s bing increasingly difficult to hold back my instincts to fight everyone off of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Kathy brought some oxygen with the chair. I need submission, Cole. Let us help you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m having a hard time fullyprehending what he’s telling me as I feel him wrap tubing around my ears before I hear the click of the seat belt around my waist. “Thank you, Kathy. I’ll take him from here. Grab yourself a bite to eat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listen as she walks away in the opposite direction than we are rolling. I struggle to open my eyes and I can feel my head rolling around with my increasing disorientation. I try to sit up but a strong yet gentle hand holds me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Sit back Cole. We’re almost there .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I must have passed out shortly after as when I opened my eyes again I found myself in a very medical room, triggering my anxiety again. My movements are slow and easily pacified as the alpha starts trying to help me out of the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need to get you on the bed. I need you to wrap your arms around my neck and I’m going to put my arms under yours to get you standing. Then we’re going to turn slightly so you can sit on the bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer I hear the click of thep belt just seconds before feeling his hands moving my arms. I reach up and timidly wrap my arms around the alpha’s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know it’s a lot to ask but it’s okay to trust me. Don’t be afraid to touch me .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha whispers as he starts to lift me to a stand. It’s a struggle to orient myself to a stand but something about alpha’s voice, patient and reassuring, calms the fight I have despite the pain he  is  creating from his hold on me.</p>
