                <p>I walk quietly out of the bathroom, my thick shaft twitching at the sight of my mateying still, with her front half down on top  of  three pillows, hugging them tightly with her beautiful round ass sticking up in the air. Her intoxicating scent is marred with the bitter stench  of  fear. and pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly?” I question quietly as I will not proceed if she’s sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m okay, Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispers. I know it’s a lie. There’s no way she’s ok right now. I kneel on the end of the bed, gently rubbing my hands along her back, ass and legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you certain this is what you want? What you need?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. Please be gentle.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Always my love. Never anything else.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run my hands gently down her thighs before using gentle pressure to widen them. I run my palm gently against her mound before using my middle finger to rub ginger circles around her clit. I bring my hand back towards her rear using my fingers to gently expose her entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Stay still, my love. Let me do the work. Rushing this will make the pain worse.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I use my other hand to gently push my tip into her, using my weight to slowly advance my length into her depth. Her body starts shaking as  I  get deeper within her ,  only stopping when only about an inch is left to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to move. He always moved the items  is  such a way to simte sex. I can’t tell without you doing the same.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can tell by her voice that she’s trying not to cry. I lock into her link again as I start to slowly push and pull my length inside her. I’m only moving a fraction of me right now as anything more would be excruciating to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly,”  I  speak softly as  I  continue my slow gentle strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to tell me what you need. I will not change the speed or force but I can give you more length if you think it will help.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can tell she’s concentrating hard, trying to figure this out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need more.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh hard as I lengthen my strokes causing her to yelp and whimper. I wrap my arm around her thighs pulling her back so hers are touching mine. She goes silent as I maintain my motion. I know without a doubt this is it. I slow my motion to aplete stop  as  she struggles to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Breathe Lilly.” I gently rub her back as her shaking gets worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Move with me baby. This is done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tone is gentle yet concerned as guide her off of me while also pulling out. I gently pick her up in my arms, as her body is now bpletely  stiff, andy her on her side. I silently hold her from behind, kneeling beside the bed as she slowly breaks down from the  reality   of   her   past .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wait until her sobs are quiet to let go of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ I’ve  got to go unlock the door for Ang to get in, Lilly. I’m not going far.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper as Iy a gentle kiss upon her temple. This is turning out to be one hell of a day as I cover her naked body with  a   sheet  .   I  walk  over</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to  my pants and pick my boxers up, taking them with me as I leave the bedroom and enter the  main  office. I draw the door to the Bedrooms mostly closed just as I hear a light knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Who is it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I call, as the only person I’m letting in while I’m still naked is Ang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She calls from the other side. I unlock the door and open it slightly to let here in. I lost my modesty with Ang a long time  ago  .   Seeing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>e door again. She looks upon my slowly deting shaft before looking back to me. the state I’m in she steps in quickly, closes and locks the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t think you used those anymore. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t” I sigh as I roll the condom off and  toss  it in the  trash . “And I won’t be ever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I step quickly into my boxers before sitting in my chair behind my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You seem to be having a really hard time for a man who just got tied.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at her briefly before ducking my head between my hands. I know she’s trying to be light but I’m struggling to process everything  that  has happened all before noon today.</p>
