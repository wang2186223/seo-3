                <p>“For me to stay. I barely heard him but he said ‘please don’t leave me Jamie.‘ I told him I wasn’t and asked about his hand, asked if it would  hurt   him  if held it. He told me no and held his hand open until I put my hand in his. Dad told me that Cole wasn’t happy about it as he’s  very  afraid of the hospital  but   he  had convinced Cole to go to the hospital. He needed my help to get Cole out of the tub and into at least a robe for the ride to the hospital .   He   tried   to  hold back his pain but he couldn’t do it. He yelped repeatedly every time he moved. He yelped when I touched his leg to guide him out of the  tub  .  He  truly  was blind and struggled with everything he did but dad managed to get a robe on him and together we got him in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad had to drive slow because every bump we hit hurt him badly. It took longer than normal to get there but as soon as we did dad ran inside  and   got   Dr.  Carter. As soon as the doctor saw him he ran back in and grabbed a wheelchair. With dad’s help he got out of the car and inside the hospital.  I   was   almost  eighteen by that time so I parked the car before going inside too. By the time I found them Cole was in a room in an absolute panic. Dad had to  keep  talking to him because every time dad moved he thought it was the nurse doing something to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dad got him to trade the robe for the gown he encouraged Cole to wrap himself around him. Toy on him like he had in the tub. It helped Cole a  lot . Such a simple thing as being held. Being touched without being harmed. It seemed foreign to him, yet soforting. Dad got very protective of Cole .  Every time a nurse came in with restraints he turned them away. One nurse tried twice to do the IV. After the second failure he ended up cussing her  because   she   was  ming Cole when Cole was being very cooperative.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Did they give up on putting one in?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>slower pace. Dr. Carter exined  to  “No. Dr. Carter came in and put one in near his ankle. He yelped and cried badly but he got it in. I was the one to point out the medication was hurting him. I was surprised when the doctor listened. He stopped and waited for Cole to calm down before giving him more at dad everything that needed to be done to find out the full extent of his injuries but Cole kept saying no, that his budget wouldn’t allow for such expensive tests to be done and would lead to his dad finding out that he went to the hospital. That’s when dad told him and Dr. Carter that the money to pay  for  his care was toe from my ount with the hospital.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I thought medical care was budgeted?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It is. I don’t know where the fundse from or how things are determined but every wolf in  the  pack receives  a  certain amount every year and what  isn’t  used by the end of the year rolls over to the next year. I wasn’t ident prone  so  my hospital funds were quite high. Once Dr. Carter understood how genuine dad’s concern for Cole was he actually introduced himself as Alex and really went into details about each item as they came up. Dad stayed with Cole through everything. He talked to Cole during the CAT scan and MRI, stayed the night to help him use the bathroom and to eat. He ended up cussing several nurses because they kept bringing in a catheter and feeding tube. Dad figured out very quickly why Cole was terrified of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole was in the hospital for a week. The only injuries I heard mentioned was that  every  single rib was bruised and broken in multiple ces, he had a fractured skull, a fractured eye socket and a small amount of swelling in his brain. I’m almost certain  there  was more but I wasn’t there when Dr. Carter first started talking to dad.”</p>
