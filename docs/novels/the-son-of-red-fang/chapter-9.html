                <p>I nod quietly again yet against my better judgment I ask the question I think I know the answer to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What happens to prospects that have a major mental health issue, like ptsd?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It depends a lot on how stable the individual is and why they have it. A lot of wolves have ptsd from battles where they witnessed pack mates killed or they were severely injured. It can have asting effect but with therapy and proper medication the council will allow them to return.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Not the answer you thought?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head as I follow them out the door to where the food is set out. No one is down here yet which is a relief for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you good on your own now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look at the alpha before nodding my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you Alpha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“For what?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“For your kindness.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a smile before cing his hand on my shoulder. For the first time that night I manage to keep myself from pulling away or jumping out of my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s a pleasure to meet you Cole. We will talk more in the morning.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly finish my third trip out to the table as the rest of the pack has starteding downstairs to eat. I can already hear several of themining about the special treatment I seem to be getting over recognizing that they brought this on to themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was grateful that I had discovered a small table with a chair just inside the door to my room as this is where I ended up putting all the food and drinks that I picked up from the table. I had walked with Alpha and his son down the hall to the closet before heading to the table so I was able to get all theundry supplies I needed before grabbing dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel guilty as I look at the tes of food and a dozen or so drinks sitting on the table. I know I won’t eat all this food tonight. Between my father actively denying me ess to food and him keeping me in a constant state of pain and panic I’ve gotten used to eating very little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sit at the table and turn on the television, picking lightly at the food in front of me, I surf through the channels. I have always found it interesting to encounter packs that have started to embrace human inventions like the television, inte, and cell phones. I guess with a lot of therger packs now having major hospitals on theirnd with wolves that aren’t members working there the use of cell phones became a necessity since not all the wolves have a link with the pack. I set my sights on the human’s strong man contest. I’ve always found it interesting how human men had the desire to prove their strength by donning a harness like a dog and pulling a bus several yards with only the help of a rope to pull on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally give up grazing on the food I brought into my room shortly after I started. My anxiety is still extremely high and I’m finding it difficult to eat. I’m not used to a pack’s alpha getting so invested and hands on with the prospects so early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take the cling wrap I found in the closet and carefully dismantle the sandwiches of the lettuce, tomato and onion so the bread doesn’t get soggy before wrapping each one and cing it in the fridge, doing the same for the condiments and drinks. I wipe the table down with the paper towels and multi purpose cleaner that were also in the closet before heading to the washer and cing my clothes in the dryer. I started taking care of my own needs when I was fifteen, so keeping my own space clean is second nature to me now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I explore the room a little more and discover a walk-in closet with hangers already inside it. I grab a handful of those and ce them on the table to use once my clothes are dry. The tv is on top of a long dresser situated against the wall across from the foot of the bed, that’s where I head next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open each drawer taking in the approximate size so as to best n my use of space. I head into the bathroom next. The bathroom floor is a neutral beige colored stone like tilepared to the ck carpeting in the rest of the room. There’s abination tub and shower against the far wall, arge vanity with arger single sink and arge cab with a mirror on the wall. I open the cab to find that it’s already stocked with a small amount of personal items. It’s only when I go to throw them away that I discover that every item is unopened. I’m impressed that they thought to stock it like this as I put the items back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside the vanity appears to be a tall slender cab only about a foot wide with a long door on bottom and a shorter door on top. When I open the bottom door I find a single shelf stacked with towels while below the shelf, on the floor is a small vacuum, a bucket and a mop. The only thing missing is the soap. Opening the top cab reveals washcloths and hand towels. Once again, everything appears to be new. Not liking the idea of my towels being in with cleaning supplies, I rearrange the upper cab to amodate all of the bathroom linens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the shower curtain back I find unopened shampoo, conditioner and a bar of soap with an unrolled bath mat sitting in the corner. It seems like they have thought of everything in this pack. I don’t even feel like I have to unpack the stuff I brought with me. I do anyway as I don’t believe in being wasteful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unload my two backpacks of my personal items, finding a logical ce for each item before folding my packs and putting them in the closet. I sigh heavily with the realization that my bag had been gone through and what little asthma medication I had left was removed before my bags made it to the bus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the dryer is done I take my clothes to the table where I fold everything neatly and hang my shirts before putting everything away. I gently take my shirt off and toss it in the washer before climbing into the full size bed. It’s been an exhausting day of traveling and despite my constant pain from the beating I got Saturday night, it doesn’t take long for me to drift to sleep.</p>
