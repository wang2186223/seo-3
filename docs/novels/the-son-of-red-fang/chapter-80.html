                <p>“ Just like with the chair, I’m going to wrap my arms around you and you do the same to me. You push and I’ll pull to get you  up  .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s  quiet but speaking better than this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 remove the oxygen cann from under his nose and the pulse oximeter from his finger. I give him a slow count, keeping my voice soft and  neutral  .   We  seed in getting him up but not without several painful yelps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Take your time to get used to your legs again. Let me know when you’re ready to move. I want to stay with you in case you fall.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He  nods his head as he shifts his weight from one foot to the other, testing out his bnce while his hands are on my shoulders. I rx my hold on  him , giving him some freedom to move about. He’s swaying badly, which is a big concern to me regarding his oxygen intake. Surprisingly he starts walking towards the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamie, walk with him on the other side please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie doesn’t miss a second as he apanies Cole and I to the bathroom. Despite his initial swaying when he stood up, he made it slowly to the bathroom without issue. I shoo Jamie out as I help Cole get situated, exiting once he’sfortable. Jamie finds a chair to sit in while  I   get  some soup out of the  fridge  and start heating it up. I also pull out the special form we put in the tube so I can warm it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timing is perfect as Cole rings the call bell for me toe into the bathroom. I open the door slowly and call his name .   He’s  still seated with his head hung down and his eyes closed. I can tell by the way he breathes that he’s trying desperately to control his anxiety.  “ Cole.”  I  speak gently in an effort to calm him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ If  exposing the rest of the damage your father has done is causing this much anxiety then perhaps it would be best to wait until tomorrow.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It won’t be….. any easier to wait.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk over to where he’s seated and crouch down to his level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look at me,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give him a moment to bring his eyes to mine. He’s reluctant butplies with my request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is only going to help you Cole. I’m not going to touch anything this time so the only pain you will feel will onlye from your movements and the gown rubbing against your skin.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He  nods his head as he attempts to stand. I ce my hand gently on his knee stopping his movements. I wait for his eyes toe back before continuing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When you stand I would like you to take a  few  steps away from the toilet before putting both your hands on the rail. Stand as straight as you can but don’t cause yourself pain in doing it. I will untie the back of your gown. Just let it fall to your wrists. While the rail is supporting you I will take pictures of your back, butt and the backs of your thighs. After that I’ll have you turn so that one hand is on the rail. I’ll take the gown from you and I’ll take the pictures  t  need of your chest, abdomen, groin and thighs. Are there any other areas that are bruised or cut that I need to document?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can tell he’s hesitating which tells me there is.</p>
