                <p>Tuesday, January  23</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  fall from my bed as I violently fight against the nkets that I have wrapped around me. My ass hitting the floor jars my back badly sending waves of sharp pain through my back and legs, knocking the breath right out of me in the process. I immediately start into dry heaves as  my  body starts trying to tid itself of what little I managed to eat yesterday. I scramble on all fours, never making it to my feet, as I push myself to the bathroom before heaving dinner into the toilet. As I sit back against the tub I realize that not only am I in a serious panic attack but I’m starting into a bad asthma attack as well. I’m gasping for breath as my panic consumes me. It takes everything I have to keep myself sitting up but I know it’s not going tost as ck spots litter my vision. I manage to check my watch and register in my mind that it’s midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Great,‘ I think to myself ‘still seven hours before someone finds me‘ as I copse into unconsciousness .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wake gasping for breath two more times before I can get enough air into my lungs to move my body off the floor and into my bed. I stack the pillows against the wall so that I’m elevated as I wrap a nket around my shoulders. I’m shivering hard from both fear and cold and for once I find myself longing for the patient kindness of the alpha I just met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never have I wished so hard for a phone and the number to someone so powerful yet I’m also terrified. Terrified that this will send me home early destroying any chances I have at getting into this pack.  My  first impression of  every  ce  I’ve  gone is a powerful one. Despite my constant gasping for air and the painful throb in my chest I manage to drift to sleep again as it’s only 3am.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My rm goes off at six and I know immediately that it’s going to be a rough day. My chest is painfully tight, barely letting me move any air through and I know that taking a shower is a no go. It takes all my energy just to walk to my closet for a clean shirt, then to my dresser for a pair of sweatpants ,  socks and boxers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s a struggle to stay focused as my asthma attack has lowered my oxygen levels to a point where my mind is swimming with more negativity than usual. I would love nothing more than to stay in bed and pass back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grab the key to my room as I stumble towards my shoes that are sitting beside my door. Steadying myself against the wall I open the door to my room and step out in time to see everyone starting to leave. Alpha Dominic must be leading the way as it’s Alpha Damian that spots me from the rear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole ?  Are you okay ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As  much as my brain is screaming at me to work through the attack, that it’s a weakness to admit that I can’t breathe, this attack is one of the worst that I’ve had in a while. I don’t believe that I can even talk right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bow my head in submission towards him as I shake my head. I recognize that I’m in a dangerous cycle that only heavy sedation, steroids and nebulizer treatments will help with. In short, I need the hospital. I hear Damian’s footsteps before I feel his touch on my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Can you tell me what’s going on ?  “  .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once  again I shake my head as I physically can’t tell him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Come on. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He  encourages as he gently tugs at my arm. My anxiety is high enough that I yelp with the gentle gesture of help only it ends uping out sounding more like  a  strangled dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay ,  I may only be eighteen, but that doesn’t sound like a good thing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I   shake  my head, agreeing with his simple assessment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to get you to the pack house. You need to talk to dad and Dr. Pierce. I’m going to help you get there which means you’re going  to  feel  me  touching you. Is that ok?”</p>
