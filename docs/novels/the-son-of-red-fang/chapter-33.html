                <p>She opens her eyes and for the first time since I started her eyes are rxed, showing me a level of trust that I’ve never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want you Lilly. All of you. Trust mepletely. Submit to me. Let me pleasure you, rx you so my tie to you doesn’t hurt you   ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see the hesitatione forward in her eyes again. I pull my finger from her cunt and ce it in my mouth to clean it off holding back my hum of enjoyment from tasting her for the first time in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the tie has happened every time we have sex she’s never been rxed enough for it to be easy for her to handle. The mate the only happens between fated mates and on a rare asion, if you find your second chance mate before your fated mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s nothing for the man except for a potential inconvenience if he’s in a hurry but it can be ufortable to extremely painful for the womars depending on how tense or fearful she is of the process. It’s especially difficult for her if the man she’s with doesn’t realize that the tie has urred and tries to force himself to separate from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, I’m sorry it’s taken so long for me to ask this of you. I know seeing the condition Cole is in has stirred up old memories. I know that’s why you sought me out. You desire the pain that has alwayse from the tie. I’m not going to hurt you. I know you’re highly sensitive right now so please, I need you to be mine.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’s looking into my eyes as I finish talking. She nods her head as she whispers “I’m yours” in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Submit to me Lilly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper back as I gently nip her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m yours Demetri, just do one thing for me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Absolutely Lillian, what do you need?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to understand what happened to me. The young man’s chest started it but the tie. The tie has always been a bad trigger for me. So you’re right Demetri. I sought you out because I need to tie to you. I need to tell you of those bad memories, not bury them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you certain this is the best way to do this? My instincts tell me to push you but I don’t want to hurt you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks at me lovingly but that love is shadowed with fear. She knows exactly what this is going to do to her yet she’s asking for it anyway. It’s been a long time since I’ve agreed to let her release like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There’s something you need to understand before I give this to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods her head as she looks into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not going to stop this time. I’ve allowed you the control now it’s my turn. I need you to understand that’s what I mean by you being</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mine.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not the first time you’ve asked for control like that. I know what it means.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Lilly. I have never asked for control when you’ve sought me out. The only time you seek me sexually is when something has happened that triggers a memory of what he did to you. I have never understood why but you know it’s true. Why else would you admit that the tie is a big trigger but that’s what you need from me? Right now as I talk with you I see the fear in your eyes. I know this is going to be a challenge for you but something tells me you need this. I can’t exin why now is the time but it is.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The apprehension has grown in her eyes as I have held eye contact with her as I’ve talked. I lean down and take her mouth in mine before gentling my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to challenge you my love so I need these things from you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods her head agreeing to what I need from her before I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do not fight me. Do not stop me. Nothing I do to you is going to hurt you. I need you to trust and have faith in me that I will not hurt you Lilly. Open your link to me. Lock on to me. I need to feel everything that you feel that way if there is any hint of pain I can adjust what I’m doing and most importantly, the tie will happen. I’ve been pulling out before finishing because I can’t get out fast enough afterwards. This time, we are going to tie and once it’s fully established I want to roll onto our sides to see if that’s easier for you to handle. I’m going to do what I’ve wanted you to feel for years Lilly. Don’t be afraid. I promise it feels good and there’s nothing bad about it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There’s fear in her eyes as she leans up to kiss me. Long and sensual telling me her desire despite her fears. My fears of hurting her again have held me back for two decades and now she’s asking me to trigger some of the worst experiences she’s ever had and refused to tell. There’s something about today that tells me this is my only shot. I’m finally going to learn what Alpha Tanner did to her so many years ago.</p>
