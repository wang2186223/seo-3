                <p>It’s  as  he starts to kneel that I grab his arm, stopping him from moving. He makes eye contact with me briefly before looking back in the grand in a respectful submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks worried but doesn’t say anything to me. I grab two stools from across the room and call his name as I roll one over to files. I kick the ster consistently as I walk back over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you ever seen him while he’s at General?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Only the two times that my dad and I took him. He’s not allowed to have friends. I think his father is afraid the secrets of their rtionship will get out. It’s not easy for Cole there. I’m sorry Cole. I shouldn’t be sharing your business like this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay….., Jamie…. He’s….. a doctor…. Ite’s…. already…. figured…. it out…. He’d….. be stupid….. not to….. Let Jamie…. speak for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It would be easier for you tomunicate through the link so yes, that’s fine. With certain statements I may ask you to verify what he’s said so at non or give me a thumbs up, whichever is easiest for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a thumbs up as he adjusts his position to be more on his belly than his back. He scrunches his face briefly with the movements showing me the pain he’s in without yelping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you need something more for the pain?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He said Dr. Pierce just gave him vi–co–profen? Am I saying that right ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes Jamie, that’s what we’ve been giving him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, I haven’t heard of that. Well she gave him that and restarted the nebulizer and steroids not long ago so he doesn’t think he can get  anything  more.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll check and see what we can do for you after we get Jamie stitched up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opens his eyes for the  first  time in a while. It’s the first time I’ve noticed his  eye  color. It’s dark, but it’s not  brown  like mine.  It  looks almost  ck  like he’s in a partial shift. I ce my hand under his head, tilting it slightly up so I can make eye contact with him without it being overly ufortable. He manages to keep contact with me for a minute or two, long enough to  see  what I was looking for before he starts squirming ufortably in my hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Cole but I was trying to confirm that you weren’t in a partial shift. That your eyes are actually dark navy . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exin as Iy his head back on the pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My father noticed that too when he moved in with us for a year and a half. He told me that his eyes never changed color. They’ve been like that his entire life. Dad said that it means something but could never figure out what.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It is quite significant for an adult to have what we call pup blue  eyes .”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Pup blue eyes, sir?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“All babies, human and werewolf, are born with navy blue eyes. In humans, the eye color changes around six months but in werewolves it tends to be around four to six years old depending on the wolf’s maturity level and birth rank. Omegas tend to mature faster than alphas.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So what does it mean when a wolf keeps the pup blue ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can tell by the way Cole is looking at me that he’s quite interested in the answer as well. I sigh hard, not wanting  to  let hi know about the level of abuse he must have suffered to be where he is now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>how much I actually</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Pups only keep the navy color if their emotional maturity is severely stunted by severe trauma. If the wolf’s eyes don’t change due to ongoing, long term trauma, by twelve years old then their  eyes  never will.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can see a hint of sadness in both of their eyes. I reach out and run my fingers through Cole’s hair. He stiffens badly and closes his eyes again. I can tell he’s fighting himself and his desire to make me stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We need to get you patched up Jamie. It looks like Ang is ready for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Won’t my wolf heal it in a week or so?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Yes he will but in that time it couldpletely healed in three days . ”</p>

                <p>“Okay, if you think that’s best.”</p>
