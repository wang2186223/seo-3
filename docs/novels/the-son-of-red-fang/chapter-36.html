                <p>After a minute or two, I shift my body on top of her again, using my legs to gently coax her legs into the open butterfly again. I wrap  my  arms around her as I slowly grind my hardness into her again. She’s not quite as rxed this time as she knows the second  time  I  do   this   falways  enter herpletely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  slide slowly against her until my soldier is resting between her lips, gently rubbing against her clit. I push slowly towards her entrance pushing the head just enough inside for her to feel the stretch before pausing. She stiffens even more as I start my slow grind again. I’m  too  predictable but in the past that’s helped her tremendously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slide my hands into hers pushing them gently into a position just beside her head as I gently take her mouth into mine. I start  my  kiss slow as I resume my rub. She squeezes down on my hands hard easily conveying the nervousness she’s always had with sex. After a minute of covering my shaft with her juices and, as if she’s a virgin, I have her distracted by my kiss, I slowly push my shaft towards her entrance.  With  slow but consistent pressure I push my thickness into her. She squeals ufortably as she struggles against my simple hold on her, I simply match my movements to hers until my length ispletely within her, pausing before going any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Breathe my darling.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper in her ear trying to calm her fight. Her eyes are closed as Iy gentle kisses along the side of her face. I’m concentrating on my  bond  and link with her, trying desperately to find any hint of pain that I may be causing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, baby. I need you to focus. I need you to feel what’s happening to you right now and nothing else.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face is against hers as  I  speak allowing me to feel her nod easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m feeling everything that you are feeling and no matter how I try I don’t feel any pain. Am I hurting you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breathing has returned to normal and her movement has slowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Demetri, you’re not hurting me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally whispers back. I nuzzle into her neck taking in her intoxicating scent as I slowly start my short gentle movements inside her. I can feel every move I make using our locked links. She is indeed super sensitive this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It doesn’t take me long to get a slow but consistent pace going. Sliding easily, gently, and with every few strokes pulling out a little further and pushing in a little deeper. This slower pace allows me tost longer spending as much time with her as I possibly can. She squeezes my hands hard and her breathing bes erratic as I develop a steady pace. It’s feeling really good to me so I maintain everything, pressure, speed, the length of the push and pull, everything. It’s only when I feel her fight renew that I slow again, breaking the building feeling we were both having. It’s when I look down at my love’s face that I realize she’s struggling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh Lilly. It was feeling so good. What happened?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper as Iy my body against hers again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Demetri. It’s good. It really is. I just…. I just….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’s struggling badly just to exin but it’s the link that tells me everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shhh, Lily it’s okay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Dem. After twenty years I still can’t do it. I can’t be with you the way you deserve .  I don’t know how.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look at me, Lil.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. I’m sorry. I just can’t do this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’s shaking her head as the tears fall down her face.  As  bad as this  makes  me feel I  now  know exactly what she  needs   and   she   will   get  it .   I   let   go  of her hands, making her even more lost then she already was. I slide my arms under her shoulders, taking her head  in  my hands. Iy my cheek against hers as she finally breaks down in sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I   know  as long as I stay inside her I’ll stay hard enough to start again. Werewolves have incredible stamina while working towards  orgasm   and  recovery time is very short. It’s not umon for the young ones to go three or four times in a night as long as they are tender  with   their</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mates .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You need this more than you know Lilly. It’s time to let go of your past dear. I took you away from Alpha Tanner twenty–four years  ago  but instead of healing you merely buried what he did to you. You need to trust mepletely Lilly. Let yourself have this release as I do believe  it  will help you process the difference. You’ve never allowed me to be with you when your cycles have merged. You’ve always been too sensitive to handle it and now I understand why. What you were feeling, that’s what sex is supposed to be. Overwhelmingly raw with indescribable sensations that you never get used to building in intensity until everything, your mind, body, and soul explodes with energy you didn’t know existed. It is absolutely beautiful and indescribably loving.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start moving my hips again, pressing myself gently into her, holding that pressure several seconds before slowly drawing back slightly and doing it again. I know she’s feeling it again when she starts to whimper, shifting her body as if she wants to get away from it. This time I’m doing something different. I’m holding her tight while I move at a much slower pace. I’ve increased the pressure, driving myself deeper within her then I pull out. I’m still locked in a link with her and the sensations I’m receiving from her tells me that physically, she’s feeling  what   she  should be enjoying. Mentally she’s struggling immensely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear her beg in her mind for me to stop. That she can’t handle it but I know she can. She’s just scared. I lean down and with a soft, approving hum capture her mouth in mine, maintaining the speed and pressure of what she feels inside her. She finally starts to rx with what she feels as I get my tongue in her mouth. She lets a gentle moan escape when  I  speed up slightly just to cut it off suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Don’t hold in what you feel darling. I want to hear you. Your voice is beautiful.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally epts what she’s feeling and arches her pelvis into me. I can’t help but growl as I maintain my speed allowing her to match my moves easily. We have synced our movements creating absolute bliss for both of us as our release approaches. Our moans melt together, getting louder with each stroke until with a scream, Lilly meets her release. With her walls squeezing against me rhythmically I increase my force and speed allowing me to feel my slowly erging head within her signaling my owning release. Within seconds of her release, I meet my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>own .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Groaning and growling with each thrust into her until I finish with a final thrust deep into her pelvis. I maintain my pressure, keeping my head buried deep against her womb as the mating knot continues to establish. It’s as I get bigger within her that the difort of the tie triggers her memories, quickly losing the enjoyment of the moment to the nightmares of her past .</p>
