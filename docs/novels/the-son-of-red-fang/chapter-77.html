                <p>“It’s okay to let go, Jamison.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice is gentle as 1 encourage the emotional release I know the young man needs as I hold him close to me. It doesn’t take long before  I   feel  his body shake with silent tears, his hands balling into fists around the fabric of my shirt. Giving him permission to talk to me was more about givingmie the emotional release he needed than a cry for help from Cole, but in encouraging it, I’m closer to knowing the truth about Cole. I rub jamie’s back until his body rxes before heading him over to the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to thank you for your willingness to be open with me on what your experience with Cole has been even though Cole is hesitant to be the same. It seems like he’s been burned by other packs for sharing the truth of his situation which only makes it harder for me”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie takes a moment to wipe his face before looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please don’t let the nasty rumors about him cloud your judgment of him. He really is a good person. Never once has he ever done anything to make me or dad believe that he could be a rapist or pedophile. He needs help alpha. Beyond anything anyone can truly understand, he needs help getting out of the hell he’s in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am sorry Jamie, but I can’t discuss with you what my ns are with Cole. He has caught my interest but I can  not , for the safety of my own pack, simply ignore rumors as nasty as rape and pedophilia. I have to find the  real  Cole that is hidden beneath the fear and anxiety.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie nods his head but it seems his tears have renewed at the news that I can’t simply ignore the rumors.  Are  these rumors what’s causing the council to investigate, not the abuse? Another element I must look into about Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Unfortunately, Jamie, your friendship with Cole doesn’t get you off from your fight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shakes his head as he speaks, his voice is clearer as he pulls himself together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t expect special treatment. I can assure you that Cole doesn’t want it either. All Cole wants is to be treated as an equal. Not seen as some sort of monster, as someone undeserving of a chance .  The very few wolves that have given him that chance in our pack love him dearly but it’s been proven that  no  one inside the pack can help him. Someone on the outside needs to see it and act upon what they  see  .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry to hear that no one in the pack can help him. The only thing  I  can promise you right now is he has my attention. I need time to figure out how far I can take this and what, if any, help I can provide. I don’t expect you to understand but the safety of my pack is paramount over anything else.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I do understand that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, your punishment at the moment is the same as the other three until I know who started it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand that as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He states as he nods, his head bowed in submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“At the moment, you, Andrew, Richard and Das are all on house arrest. You will report to the dining hall for breakfast, lunch and dinner otherwise you are to be in your room. I will show you where to get the water and voring packs if you desire it. Like everyone else, you may have  a  case of water in your room or drink from the sink. The water here is good, ites from underground natural springs but not everyone likes the taste of the minerals dissolved in it so we offer bottled water for drinking. One of the trainers wille get all of you so you’re not trying to find your way to the dining hall on your own. Any questions? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay. It’s obvious he has an attachment to you so for the sake of Cole’s mental health and  based  on the interaction  between   you  and Das ,   you   were  trying to defend Cole, I am going to allow you a special break.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This grabs Jamie’s attention as he lifts his head, looking at me with his head cocked slightly to one side .</p>
