                <p>“You  have  another from Red Fang you’re interested in?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know. He’s a friend of Cole’s and Cole gave him permission to talk, so I’m trying to figure out who Cole is as well as how bad things are for  him  .   1   have  a bad feeling that I’m going to need to contact Xavier on this. I need to find out if there’s any way to pull Cole from his pack like I would a wolf under twenty–one.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulls her seat up to the desk and takes her first bite of food before speaking again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you really feel that Cole is that bad off?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I found more marks on him, Lilly. His back and his rear are as bad as his chest. He has a really bad bruise along his ribs that I asked Ang to do X–rays on. He did extremely well with having the feeding tube ced but was nearly in tears when we wanted to use it because it’s been misced so many times he knew that getting fed through it was going to hurt him”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. We did it right. Outside of feeling the warmth of the form running through it ,  he didn’t feel anything but I had to stay and keep him calm and submissive until he realized that was all he was going to feel.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nods her head as she eats. She definitely seems to be doing betterpared with this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m okay Demetri. You talk with Jamison and I will sneak out the back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you certain? You really should take it  easy  today. Ang said it was  a   bad  tear.  I  don’t want you working  today  .  You need to rest.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ces her hand on the side of my face before giving me a long chaste  kiss .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m fine. I’ll take it easy and  see  you at dinner.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another kiss I nod my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I love you Lilly. Let me know how you’re doing the  rest  of the day.  Ang is bing to our room around nine. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I love you too.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m finding it difficult to separate from her for the first time in years. It feels like a whole new rtionship has formed with her willingness to finally share what happened to her over twenty years ago. I wrap my arms around her from behind, pulling her shoulders back against my chest. I bend down to bury my nose into her neck getting treated to the alluring scent of my  new  mark sending waves of the perfect mix of both our scents into my nose. My wolf purrs lightly  as  I hold her close, kissing her cheek before  I  finally let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t want to leave .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know how you feel but we still have work to do. White Fang and White Moon packs arrive  today  at four.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Patrick said that the Blue Moon pack wasing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shakes her head as she exins. “There was a mix up in the schedule. Red Fang, White Fang and White Moon are the farthest packs that participate so they alwayse first. Blue Moon and Purple Mountain will be here tomorrow. This is the first time we will have Blue Fang and Blue Mountain here, theye Thursday and Red and Yellow Mountain pack members will be here Friday. I think every wolf you invited came this time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s a  first . Do you remember the breakdown ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Seventy–five males and forty–five females. Do we have enough housing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. I never invite more than 120 prospects. Although this is definitely a first that they all responded.  I’ve  got three apartment buildings  with   sixty   rooms   in  each, plus I’ve got two prospects that will be leaving Friday due to fighting.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Is  that why Jamison is in your office ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  .   Das , one  of  the wolves degrading Cole for his asthma  issues  ,  got into a fight  with  Jamison .   Jamison  got his forehead split  open   when  Das mmed  him  into a table in the dining hall so Patrick ended up taking him to Ang for stitches. I took him to the kitchen to grab  some  lunch before bing  here–</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She  nods  as  she speaks again. “You should go enjoy your lunch.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Since  you’ve finished yours how about I walk you to the door. Please don’t hesitate to rest .  You went through a lot this morning .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  I  will Demetri.” She gives me another kiss  as  we head to the bedroom door.</p>
