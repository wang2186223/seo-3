                <p>“Sex is allowed, although I don’t smell any she-wolves on this bus so at least for this first night I don’t think that’s going to be much of an issue. Sex is to be protected at all times no matter if she ims to be on the pill or not. A variety of condoms will be stocked in the personal hygiene closets in buildings A and B. Building C is reserved for the female warriors and personal hygiene products are changed ordingly. You will be interviewed about all sexual interactions you’ve had beforeing here and notified of any positive tests thate from the STI testing. We will treat any treatable diseases detected during testing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We know it’smon for males to use this program to find their fated mates. It is alsomon for rtionships outside of fated mates to ur. While rtionships are frowned upon by the council during temporary stays at a pack, we have yet to have a group that hasn’t had multiple wolves in rtionships by the time they leave. We simply ask that you keep public disys of affection chaste and to a minimum. We do have very young wolves in this pack. Two of those young wolves are my four year old sisters. I will not be pleased if one of them were toe across one of you engaging in a make-out session, hard forey or actual sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All sexual activity shall be performed in your room, penalties will be given to those who don’tply. You are expected to remain focused on your training. If you are in a rtionship that impairs that focus please alert us to it so we can amodate you better. We want to see the best side of you that you can present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Do not present us with false ims of theft, rape or assault as all usations are thoroughly investigated and if we find a false im was made with malice, you will be sent home. Bullying is not tolerated and will be promptly penalized. Cigarette smoking is not permitted indoors. If you are a smoker, please approach Dominic or myself about a third floor room. These are the only rooms set up with a butt can outside on the balcony. Improper disposal of your butts will revoke your smoking privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Monday through Friday, you are expected to be up, showered and dressed appropriately for training outside of the dining hall by 7am which is when my father will start morning announcements. Training will start promptly at 8am, penalties will be given to those who are more than five minuteste and those who abuse the five minute allowance. We will stop training at eleven thirty to give you time to make it to the dining hall for lunch at twelve. Training resumes at one and will end at five thirty. Dinner is at six.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We do extensive testing the first four weeks that you are here, your actual training will start once everyone has been tested for strength, endurance, problem solving and morality skills and divided into the appropriate sses for each area. Dominic and I will assist you with keeping the schedule during this first week. I strongly advise you to use any free time you have to get to know the area. You will need to know how to get to the dining hall and the various training areas on your own by next Monday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our territory isrger than most and it’s important that you don’t get lost. Anyone without a cell phone should meet with one of the trainers privately so we can get you one. Everyone else, the phone numbers to every person you will interact with regrly, including the Alpha and Luna of the pack, are posted on the white board just inside the dormitory. We ask that you at least program my father’s number into your phone but having everyone’s number will provide you the best chances of reaching someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anymon issues that we see will be addressed during morning announcements, any schedule changes for the next day will be announced before dinner. You are not required to stay at the dining hall to eat and you don’t have to report to the dining hall during lunch but the kitchen staff will start cleaning up forty-five minutes after the start of each meal. Lastly, I do apologize as that simple introduction to our pack went way longer than I had anticipated.” He finishes with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before he had finished covering what most wolves would want to know the first night in a new territory, he and Alpha Cullen had handed out the keys to each of our rooms. They started together in the center and worked their way out, returning to their original positions. I have always chosen the seat furthest away from the door as it’s the shortest distance I have to walk to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m thest one to receive a key and frown as the card attached to it reads 205A. Looks like I’m on the second floor. Alpha ck is now standing a foot behind me after he’s given me my key. Alpha Cullen has exited the bus prompting the majority of the eager warriors to stand and follow after him. I have always stayed behind as crowding others to get off the bus has never been my style, plus it gives my nerves a little time to dpress before I’m required to function like there is nothing wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“One more thing,” Alpha ck interrupts the crowd fighting to get off the bus. “Since we knew you would be arrivingte we had the kitchen crew set up a variety of cold cuts and drinks in the entrance hall. You’re wee to sit and chat with each other or grab a te full and head to your room.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles with a nod as two dozen male wolves work on exiting the bus and gathering their things from underneath. Although this is the mostfortable bus I’ve ever traveled on, my injuries have made me incredibly stiff and slow at getting started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey there, what’s your name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look up, somewhat startled as I’ve never been addressed before getting off the bus. I make eye contact with the young alpha before quickly looking away, head and eyes trained to the floor of the bus. Over the years my father has made me extremely submissive for an alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey, you haven’t done anything wrong. I just wanted to know your name.” He speaks casually with a slight chuckle in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Alpha ck. My name is Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hangs his head, slowly shaking it back and forth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did I say something wrong?” I ask, already worried that I’m screwing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, not at all.” He responds with a broad smile on his face. “It’s just the first time anyone has bothered to call me Alpha ck.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is there something else you would prefer to be called?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m failing miserably at steadying my trembling voice and my nervousness has worsened my grasping tic. He ces his hand on mine causing me to jump and make eye contact with him. Before I can look away he stops me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Keep it, Cole. Eye contact is eptable here. The only time we expect submission is when you’re being disciplined. Considering you’re from Red Fang I know that we tend to have a lot of trouble with prospects from that pack but something tells me you’re different. Don’t be afraid of us, just be yourself. We are strict but fair and if you stay the full six months you have a chance at the second run. Are you new to this? How old are you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not new. New locations, schedules and people tend to make me nervous until I get used to everything. I’ll be twenty-three Saturday.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re young but older than me.” He says with a smile. “Alpha Damian, okay. Alpha ck just sounds too much like talking to my father.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head and offer him a shy smile as I look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey,” he says, reaching his hand out to me. I timidly take his hand as he pulls me from my seat. “It’s been a long ride. Let’s get you settled in and something to eat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a deep breath as he motions towards the front of the bus. I head that direction, taking my time on the stairs. I take a few steps away from the bus once I’m on the ground making sure Alpha Damian has enough room to get off. I look around to see that all the luggage put in storage under the bus has been pulled out and ced on the ground. I immediately spot Taylor and Tyler, fraternal twins, alreadying to blows over their luggage. I was surprised when Alpha Damian excused himself from me to break the twins up. I’ve never been important enough for anyone in the higher chain of my pack to be polite.</p>
