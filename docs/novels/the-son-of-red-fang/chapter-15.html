                <p>Exactly to his words, once I’m standing, he guides me in a gentle turn allowing me to feel when to sit instead of pushing. I sit on the edge of the bed, pushing myself to breathe as it feels like the vise on my lungs is mping down harder. The whimpers from my childhood are even. more persistent as the spike in my anxiety is getting worse, worsening my asthma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dr. Pierce was able to get a hold of Dr. Carter. He mentioned that you get really anxious in the hospital making the whole process of  getting  better harder and longer. I have also picked up on your hesitation towards me. Which makes me believe that your alpha is quite harsh with you. Is he?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head slowly as  I  attempt to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“My …. dad…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Your dad is also your alpha? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damn that  was  a quick put together.‘ I think  as   I  slowly nod again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So you are indeed one of Alpha Charles Redmen’s sons?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay. I feel this is going to be strange for you but I would like to try to help you like I do with Damian. If you haven’t picked up on it yet, he’s my oldest son and he’s also extremely afraid of the hospital. So over time  I’ve  created ways tofort him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s right about one thing. Gettingforted in the hospital hasn’t been  easy  toe by as my father has increased restrictions on me which decreased my ess to decent help outside of Dr. Carter. The only people that have ever gone to the hospital with me are Mr. Jenkins and his son Jamie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to talk you through everything that’s going to happen to you before it happens but I would like to try to help you feel safe. I don’t think it will be easy as youck the trust that my own son has towards me, but I’m patient and persistent so if you’ll allow me to get close to you , by with you, I really think I can help.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod again giving him permission even though it’s going to be a hard internal fight to allow it to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay Cole. There’s going to be a lot of touch but you need to understand that none of it is negative. Nothing we do here is a punishment. Everything is to help you. The worst thing that will happen is Dr. Pierce starting an IV on you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’ve  been keeping my eyes closed in an effort to rx, trying desperately to ease my ability to breathe but at the mention of an IV I can’t help</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but pop my eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I see a lot of fear in those eyes of yours. Do you have a hard time with needles too?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod slowly, gasping in the process as my chest tightens and burns with theck of oxygen. I curl my hands around the sheets on the bed.  I’ve  yet to move fully onto the bed but to my benefit alpha hasn’t moved very far from me either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It startles me when I feel arms around me again. It’s my own reaction to sliding off the edge of the bed that surprises me even more. I throw my arms around his neck as I fall, grabbing hold of his shirt tightly when I do. I’m struggling badly again  as  the fear of being in the hospital and the multiple attempts it will take to get the IV started consume me. Despite mypleteck of control I attempt tomunicate my fear to the alpha,  even  though I know it’s not going to make a difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please ….  no…. IV…. hurts …..  bad…… too…. many ….  tries ….  please …..  some…. thing…else….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m gasping hard by the time I’m done but what I don’t anticipate is an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand your  fears  Cole, I really do. But if you’re afraid of needles then the IV is the best way to get you the medication you need. I promise Dr. Pierce is really good and  I  will help you rx and get through it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wheeze as my fear of getting an IV is as high as my fear of being tied down and the two always end up happening at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No… IV….. no…. tie…. me…. please…. no…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My  struggle intensifies as I truly believe that’s what’sing next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, rx with me. Let me try to understand this .  ”</p>
