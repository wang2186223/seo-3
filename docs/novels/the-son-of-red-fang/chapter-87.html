                <p>I  wake with a groan as my two little princesses take turns jumping on me. This is turning into one of the longest days I’ve had in a  while . Physically and emotionally draining with everything I have learned today. Cole’s abuse is the worst that I have ever seen in regards to his physical and mental  abuse  .  My own luna and her finally realizing the full extent of the sexual abuse she suffered has weighed on us both today. She has struggled to be her normal usbest self which has caused questions to cycle around the pack as to what happened between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts about Jamie and Dr. Carter and their involvement with Cole has raised some serious questions about Red Fang and how the  alpha  interacts with the pack as a whole. Is Cole’s hesitation towards talking about the full extent of the abuse simply a matter of protecting those who actually  care  about him? I don’t think so. The young man trembles every time I find a new wound on him. Even so much as begged me not to punish him for not telling me about that burn on his leg when I asked about any cuts and bruises that I needed to know about on the sides of his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, something happened to him that has made him terrified of telling me. That has made him believe not only can no one in the pack help him but no one on the outside can either. I can’t  even  begin to imagine how hopeless that must feel. To be trapped in a pack that hates you. To feel like you were  never  meant to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I roll over to the middle of the full size bed in my office. I handed getting White Fang and White Moon packs off the bus over to Patrick. I needed some time to think and dpress after helping Ang do a debridement surgery on  Cole’s  leg. The young man handled the twilight sleep well. Our concern  now  is waking him up since he seems to be having a hard time metabolizing  the  Valium we gave him this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reversed the anesthesia two hours ago and  I’ve  yet to hear that  he’s  awake. I ended up taking a nap and asked Lilly to  wake  me at 5:30, before taking the girls to dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy, daddy, daddy. Wake up. The sun is up, you should be too.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more rambunctious of the twins, Madisyn, is jumping on the bed beside me. I feign sleeping for a bit longer before suddenly grabbing the four year old and tossing her into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeals from the surprise beforeughing as shends in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Daddy! That was fun. Do it again!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kicks and squirms with anticipation with the brightest smile every parent loves to  see  .  I sit up in the bed with her in my arms bringing her into my chest for a tight hug. I duck my nose into her tiny neck and breathe in the sweetness of my girl before grabbing her  sister  ,  with a squeal, and doing  the  same to her. They rest quietly against my chest as I look into Lilly’s  eyes .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How are you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask as I touch her face bringing her in for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m okay. Today’s been a rough day for both of us. Have you learned anything more about Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have but I want to wait until dinner to talk about that. There’s a few more things I need to do. One  of  which is to talk to Xavier Bluemon. That’s why  I  wanted you to wake me. I’ve got a phone conference with him at  six  .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you having dinner at the hall with us ?  ”  Madilyn asks. Her voice is soft and sheepish, sounding almost sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Lynnie. I’ve got an important meeting on the phone that I have to attend. But we will have dinner together tomorrow night. I might even have  a  guest if I can get the young man to wake up.”</p>
