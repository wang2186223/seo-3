                <p>How do you know they are any good? That the pups won’t be abused in the new packs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There is a collective of sanctuary packs that go through a lot of research and testing with the council in order to qualify to take in troubled and seed wolves. This includes a rogue, usually a female, that the council purposely ces on theirnd to test how they handle a wolf in distress. The smaller parks that can best amodate the lowest ranked wolves and families are the ones granted second chance stature. These are the packs that are of medium wasich so they can supply the necessary mental health therapy and medical interventions needed for the wolf to recover from their trauma int they are  n  yerally struggling with low birth rates so taking in families and children, as well as keeping them in the pack is very important to them. You can’t keep a will the pack if you don’t take care of them.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause for a moment, giving her time to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘It’s a lot to ask of me, Alpha ck, but I will think about it.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you. As a show of good faith I’m going to give you permission to hunt in my eastern forest. This location is quite far from Blue Ridge  and  you don ‘  appear to be in the best condition for such a trek. My eastern forest is my closest border to Blue Ridge and it has plenty of small game you should be able to catch in your weakened state. I will alert my border patrol that you have permission to be there. Stay in the southeast quadrant of the territory. I have a gravel road that separates the north and south and ake that separates east and west. Stay in the tree line until you’re ready for my help. My border patrol will detain you if you are found outside of the territory I just described. My patrol has been well trained on recognizing and helping wolves in distress s please don’t fear them or fight them, just follow their directions and they will bring  you  to me.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stands frozen, as if she’s forgotten what she was doing or why she was there. She looks at me intently, trying to figure out how much of my offer is real. Iy patiently in the grass, hoping that my offer is enough for her to have some confidence in the deal Delta Jacobs made with me. Getting all the paps out such a horrid ce and gather enough evidence  to  shut the pack down for good in exchange for protection from the council. I have no idea whatcobs has done to need protection from the council but he was adamant about securing support, that he was simply doing what no one else was willing to do. I agreed nheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bows her head slightly before I hear her voice again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Thank you, Alpha ck. I must go now.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as the mysterious she–wolf turns tail and disappears into the thickness of the dense, dark woods.  I  shiver myself as the wind picks up in the clearing. I turn and take off back towards my territory, easily slipping through the border before my patrol has passed by. I keep my run at a steady pace until I reach the prospects dorms.  I  slow to a trot as I enter thest building from the  west  ,  building ‘A‘, the only one currently upied .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make my way to the bathrooms located on the north side between the two stairways. The light turns on automatically when I enter the one closest to the eastern stairs. I find my clothing exactly where I left them, folded neatly on the vanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building is eerily quiet as I know that twelve wolves from White Fang and twelve from White Moon arrived today so all the rooms on the   first floor should be upied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paw the door shut before starting my shift putting my clothes on once everything ispleted. I exit the bathroom swiftly and jog lightly up the stairway. to the third floor. Cole’s strong reaction to Jamie returning to the prospects dorms this evening has weighed on me heavily and I have changed my mind about him staying in his room tonight a mere thirty minutes after I dropped him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It doesn’t take long for those fears to be confirmed. The muffled sounds of an intense fight can easily   be heard before I’m even off the steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘ Patrick, Parker, Damian, Lucas and Dominic; I need you at building ‘A‘ on the third floor, now!‘ I scream through the link.</p>
