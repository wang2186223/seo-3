                <p>I’m pushing away from him but I’m weak from theck of oxygen. He changes his hand cement so I can’t get away from him, increasing  my  panic even more. I’m fighting hard making everything worse as I suddenly freeze. His hand is on the back of my head, gently rubbing my hair. I’m struggling in so many ways I can’t begin toprehend it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole,” Alpha’s voice is soft and gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’ve be very frightened very quickly of this IV so give me a chance to understand what I think you’re trying to tell me. It’s difficult to get an IV on you which makes it painful and they have to make repeated attempts to get it. It gets your anxiety high enough that you fight which results in you getting tied down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes.” I wheeze again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay. I understand there’s lots of fear and with you just getting here theck of trust makes things even more difficult. All you have to go with is what has happened before. I promise you Cole, I or Ang will tell you what we’re going to do before we do it. I also want to reassure you that I have never resorted to a hard restraint on any wolf that hase into my territory. I don’t know about Crimson General, but here in the medical wing I prefer gentler methods. Ones that allow me to calm andfort in ways that encourage a sense of safety and trust. Before you told me that you were a difficult stick I was nning onfort over power and that hasn’t changed. I’m going to help you the same way I have helped Damian in the past but it’s very important that you follow my directions.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head without thinking about whether he could see me at all but before I could muster the energy needed to speak he starts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to get in the bed. It’s a bitrger than a normal one which helps me with my methods. Step back, Cole. I’ll guide the way.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He changes his hand position to my side above my waist and takes the same tiny steps with me as I timidly step back towards the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Start sitting back. I will guide you so you don’t fall, then I’m going to help youy on your side.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ease myself back and true to his word, I’mying on my right side as he starts removing my shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang, have you set up that mask so we can run oxygen in with the nebulizer treatment?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. Just have to turn it on.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’ve closed my eyes again as my chest seems to be running a bad cycle of loosening up for a few minutes before mping back down again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I’m going to put a mask over your nose and mouth. I’m certain you’re familiar with nebulizer treatments but this is setup to have oxygen added in as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel alpha lean over me as he ces the mask over my face but submission in the hospital has always been difficult for me and oddly, using the mask during a bad attack makes me ustrophobic. I turn my head away as I feel him get close with the mask. My anxiety spikes and my chest tightens as I start fighting against the mask being put on my face. I have no control over my instincts of fight or flight which is why I always end up in hard restraints. My distressing whines start up again as I’ve started convincing myself that I’ll be the first one this alpha has to put in hard restraints. I feel his hands on top of mine as I start blindly reaching for the mask, not wanting it near me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need you to calm down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gentleness of his voice slows me down, stopping my hands from resisting his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, Cole. Since the mask seems to be difficult for you at the moment I’m going toy it beside you, close enough for you to breathe the medication. I’m going to put the oxygen cann back under your nose as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands are shaking badly as I reach up and grab the alpha’s hand as he finishes with the tubing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is there something you need to tell me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I squeeze down hard as my chest tightens again. No one outside of Dr. Carter has ever stopped to check on me, let alone ask questions when I’ve made such a simple gesture. It seems like this alpha may havee across others like me in his life making me wonder if he understands how big this simple gesture actually is for me. I flinch and gasp as he runs his fingers gently through my hair on the side of  my  head.</p>
