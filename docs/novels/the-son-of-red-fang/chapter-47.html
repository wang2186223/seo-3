                <p>“I know she’s already asleep but with everything she’s been through this morning I think a little bit of Valium would help  her   both  mentally and physically.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She holds her hand out with a small syringe in her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s up to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t want to drug her down too much right now and I don’t like the idea of giving her a shot while she’s sleeping. What did you  find  ?:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She does have a decent tear, so I’m d I went the route I did as it was far less painful and quicker. It’s about two inches long but  it was  responding nicely to the after tie medication before I cleaned everything up. I’lle up to your room around nine tonight with the second dose and walk you through giving it to her. If you have Valium in pill form I would rmend her to take that around 8:30 as the second dose still tends to be a bit painful.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, Ang.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gives me a smile as I pull her into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to head over to the medical wing.  I’ve   got  a physical toplete at 11:30 before  I   can  check on Cole. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll be headed over to Cole once I leave here. Then I’m going to have lunch with all of the trainers .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gives me a final nod before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I make my way back to Lilly,ying on the bed with her. I pull her closer to me. She whimpers at first until I touch her face  and  speak to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, I wish I could stay with you. All I want is to hold you tight and never let go.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opens her eyes and looks into mine. Her normally stunning blue eyes are dull, filled with sadness and worry .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The only thing today changes is how I help you deal with your past. I certainly won’t ever wear a condom with you again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stifle a smallugh but at least earn a smile from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Was that what you changed? Is that why you suddenly felt like him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes Lilly. All I did was put on a condom and pull you back so your thighs were leaning against mine. I felt you change as soon as  I  pulled you back. That’s why I stopped. I knew it triggered the memories. I’m sorry Lilly.  I  should have never done that to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Don’t be. I needed to finally know.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why did you wait so long to tell me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was convinced of a lot of things when he was training me. A lot of them I still struggle not to believe. He would always tell me that the luna of a pack had to be pure but that no alpha wants a luna that doesn’t know how to please him. That telling anyone what he did to me would make me a whore in your eyes and worthy of rejection.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a deep breath trying to process everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How did seeing Cole’s injuries to his chest trigger your memories? What made you change your mind  about   talking   aout   it  ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There was a period of time when he spanked me while I was still tied to the bed. It created cuts and bruises  all  over  my   chest   and   belly  .   Much  like what I saw on him today. The tenderness  I  saw with how youforted him and reassured him ,   a  bplete   stranger   that   you   just   met  reminded me of how you treated me early in our rtionship. How you fought with your father over bpleting   the   mate’s   union   ceremony</p>
                
                
                
                <p>because you knew I wasn’t ready for sex. How patiently you waited for me to be ready and how you have let  go  of your own sexual  desires   to  keep mefortable. I should have told you sooner. Maybe I could have learned to like  sex  after all that’s  happened  to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She  yelps  as  I suddenly straddle her ,  sliding my hands under her and lowering my body down against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You enjoy it more than you allow yourself to know and I have every intention of slowly ,  gently teaching you how. You deserve to  feel   it   as   it  should be without the fear and anxiety you’vee to know. I love you and I won’t give up on making you happy.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I capture her lips gently in mine. I can tell how tired she is by how hard it is for her to keep catch our breath. I gently rub the back of her head when she tries to resume the  kiss  again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay to sleep, Lilly. I’ll be backter. Are you in any pain?” up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lean my head upon her forehead as we both</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shakes her head as her eyes start to droop again. I slide off her  so  that I’m  face  to face with her again, gently stroking her  temple   as   she  falls asleep.</p>
