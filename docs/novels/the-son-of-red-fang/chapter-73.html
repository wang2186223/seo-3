                <p>It was two years after he moved out when mom found him in really bad shape in the bed they left in Jeramy’s room. Both his eyes were inset  med  vasklen shut. There was a lot of swelling and blood all over his face and hands. Goddess he screamed as soon as my dad touched him. Dad hele me from Have pers because I started falling apart seeing him like that. Dad exined that with his eyes swollen like they are he’s blind so he’s going to be motzeran20 fear response. If I felt I could handle it he really needed my help getting Cole into a salt bath. I pulled it together and went back to the rota managed to calm him down, got him talking to her. She exined that Alpha had been beating him daily for thest six weeks. Alpha had done he knew he just had to hang in there until whatever was angering the Alpha subsided. Unfortunately, that day was one where Cole got called to the four times and by thest one that evening he didn’t have the stamina to avoid his father’s hits. Cole managed to find his way to our house and in. He knew when his eyes started swelling that he needed to get somewhere safe and we were the only ones he knew would take care of him. After exined all that he very quietly apologized for screaming. He said he was in a lot of pain and it was hard to control his response to touch when see what’s going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got him up and took him to my room. He was crying by the time I got his clothes off of him. His chest and abdomen were various colors of ck, bine, purple and brown. His back, butt and the backs of his thighs were even worse. He had the ssic stripes of being beaten and cut by the belt alpha used all over his body. Everything looked to be in various stages of healing. I thought the first time dad put him in the salt bath was bad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie stops in the middle of his story, tears are streaming down his face at the memory. I can only imagine what this young man witnessed when he starts again, his voice cracking with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He screamed alpha. Goddess he screamed in pain from the salt. He fought against my father. Tried like hell to get out. He begged and cried unlike  anything  I had ever seen. I left. I couldn’t stand hearing him scream. I ran into Jerry’s room, closed the door and buried myself into the pillow. I cried like the day my grandfather died. I held my hands over my ears as I could still hear his screaming through the closed door of my brother’s room. I didn’t dare go back  into  the bathroom until he was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I could no longer hear him I went back into my room. Mom looked like she had been crying and was sitting in the doorway of the bathroom. Even dad had tears in his eyes. Somehow Cole ended up getting turned around. He was sitting in dad’sp. His legs were wrapped around dad’s waist, his arms draped over his shoulders. His head was tucked into my dad’s neck, red streaks lined his face and more were slowly falling from his eyes. Dad had his hand in his hair on the back of his head. His voice was soft and gentle as he spoke. I embarrassed myself but the first question I asked was if Cole sitting naked in hisp felt awkward. I was so…. so….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Distressed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he takes a drink of water before epting a handful of tissues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dad encouraged me to touch him but I didn’t know how, I was afraid of hurting him more but dad took my hand and put it in his hair anyway. He shift slightly in dad’sp causing him to whimper. I took my hand away from him but his voice stopped me part way.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did he want?”</p>
