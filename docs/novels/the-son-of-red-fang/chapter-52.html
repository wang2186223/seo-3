                <p>I grab the thermometer as I head over to Cole and Damian. I give Damian a smile as I speak to Cole..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is a real simple temperature check. Just stay still for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifts his arm as if to stop me when I ce the reader in his ear. Thankfully he stops part way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and simply makes a face at the brief process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“100.$ Ang.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Still low but at least it’s holding steady. We need to get him back in bed. I’ve turned everything down so it doesn’t cook him but instead of a sheet the bed is covered with a heated nket, plus the two pillows and another heated nket to cover him with. I’m hoping that he’ll sleep better if he’s warm .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to move you back to the bed. I also need you to try and at least drink a little bit of a protein drink. Eating something right now would be too difficult for you but I’m hoping you can stomach at least half a small bottle of a nutrient rich protein drink. We have chocte, vani and strawberry. I’d rmend starting with vani as it has the lightest taste but I’ll help you drink any that you choose. Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appears to be drifting in and out of sleep again as I push him the short distance to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need you to stand long enough to get in the bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrap my arms around him like before and he responds with the same. The only thing bothering me is theck of control he has for his head. I do my normal count before pulling him a bit more than he could push to get him up. I move him easily to the bed before sitting behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do we have in the fridge that he can drink now?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Chocte”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear Damian call out. He starts making his way over to the bed with two drinks in hand. He opens one for himself as he hands the other off to me. I get Cole in a good position for drinking without choking before opening it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, we werewolves can’t go very long without eating. The most is about a day and with you as sick as you are I don’t want to wait that long. I need you to drink at least half of this drink. I want you to hold it so you can control how much you get but I’m also going to hold it since you have a lot of tremors going on.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hisck of response to my request is worrying so without waiting for him to  grab  the bottle I ce it gently to his lips. His harsh reaction to get away  from  it stuns Damian and myself to the point that it takes a moment to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Open your eyes Cole. This  is  the same stuff that Damian is drinking. I need you to try it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel him stir around as Damian sits on the side of the bed but I can’t tell if he actually looks .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey” I hear Damian speak with a smile. “This stuff is actually really good. It’s formted for werewolves when they’re sick or can’t eat regr meals for whatever reason that may be preventing them from eating.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s…. in it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You know I actually don’t know.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smile when Damian rubs the back of his neck, looking sheepishly at Cole. Then, as if he realizes something, Damian’s eyes drop to the container in his hand. Spinning it slowly in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You asked what is in it. I was thinking ingredients but now that I think about what little bit we do know about you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice trails off and sadnessces his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you thinking, Damian?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can’t help but ask him for the question I haven’t thought  of  yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be pretty easy to slip Ativan of some other dissolving medication into this and no one would know until you knocked mit or got slek from an</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He states as he roughly gets up from the bed. Hees back with another, unopened bottle. Sitting back on the bed with Cole and I, he hands tole the bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not open. I know you’re tired but it’s important that you eat so look it over and when you’re satisfied that it hasn’t been tempered with you can watch one of us open it.”</p>
