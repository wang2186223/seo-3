                <p>‘You’re not a member of my pack. How are</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you able to link with me?‘ I’m taken aback by this wolf’s special ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘ I  can channel with any alpha as long as I can see them. I lost my linking ability many years ago.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize there was a difference. You look to be in rough shape and you sound too young to be a rouge. Can I help you in any way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Please don’t hurt me. Don’t tell alpha I was out here. The pups are hungry and this is the only ce I can hunt‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even through the channel I can hear the fear and panic in her young voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I don’t know who you are, how can I report anything back to your alpha? ‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I don’t know ,  Somehow he always finds out and I end up in the basement for days. ‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cock my head as Iy down. I won’t go so far as submitting to this unknown she–wolf, but considering we are on neutral territory, I can make myself less threatening and intimidating. She seems to rx a little with my efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘The only thing I can tell you is I’m the oldest orphan living in the Blue Ridge pack house. Families have been disappearing from the territory. Alpha goes mad every time the link is severed and takes his anger out on us. Delta Jacob tells me he’s the one doing  it  ,  the one taking the families from the  territory . He wants the pups, the orphans living in the house that Alpha created. I don’t trust him. I can’t when I don’t know where the families have gone.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I can assure you the families that have left Blue Ridge have done so willingly. I am Alpha Demetri ck, I am the alpha of Crimson Dawn and the alpha working with Delta Jacobs to get these families out of harm’s way. My understanding  is  Alpha Anderson may be killing wolves with pups in order to create orphans to be used as ves. Is that true?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I’m sorry alpha, I’ve said too much. I’ve got to go.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Wait sweetheart.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’spletely stiff as she freezes in ce. She’s shaking hard but in the chill of thete January night it’s hard to tell where the fear ends and the cold begins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘There’s two reasons I agreed to help Delta Jacobs. I had to agree to the first in order to achieve the second. The only reason I’m taking the families first is to prevent more pups from bing orphans when Delta Jacobs starts bringing me those who already are. ording to Jacobs, every pup living in that house is neglected and abused and to keep that from happening to any more pups I’ve got to get all the pups with their families out of the territory. I understand that you don’t trust him and you have little reason to trust me but once all the families are out it is critical for everyone’s survival to get the orphans out of that hell house. I do everything by the book and once you’re here as well, I can show you where every family and every orphaned pup has gone. My goal is to remove every pup, including you, from his abusive reign. I promise you, every family that Delta Jacobs has brought me has been provided medical care, clothing, food, water and shelter until they could be relocated to another pack equipped to meet their needs. Please think about it. We both know that the orphans can’t stay.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel her in my head, I know I haven’t lost her and I’m patiently waiting for her to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What is your n for the orphans? What will you do to them?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The orphaned pups will be moreplicated than the families so it will take more time to get them into proper foster families in packs that can raise them properly but in general they are treated the same. They will initially be brought to my medical wing. Considering thete hour that the familiese to me, I’m going to assume that the kids willete at night as well. So they will be madefortable.  A  brief physical after they’ve had a bath to verify that they don’t have any immediate medical needs before they are given clean clothes, and something to eat and drink. If there are no emergency needs, then I will set them up in one of the guest rooms I have on the ground floor so they can get some  sleep  before  a bplete physical is done. Children with emergency needs will be admitted to my hospital wing and given appropriate medical care. Those children will not be moved out of the hospital until they are stable and able to meet the majority of their basic needs appropriate for their age. How quickly things move in either case will depend on the age of  the  child, severity of abuse and neglect, and foster to adopt family avability. Unfortunately, due to the size of my pack the council will only allow me to keep the highest ranked pups, mostly alphas and betas, based on birth rank. All others, within six months to a year after theye to me, will go to other packs four to six hours away. Families have more choice in the matter but the majority choose to take the first pack they are offered.‘</p>
