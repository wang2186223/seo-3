                <p>“ What did he say ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s best that I get stitches. The lidocaine shots hurt quite a bit but it’s nothingpared to doing your gent.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 lock away from Jamie towards the bed where Ang and Patrick still sit to find the shocked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>faces that I’m certain I mittor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole? You’ve been forced to stitch your own wounds?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head slowly before Jamie begins to speak again. “His father cut his budget down severely when he was twenty–one so it was cheaper and ser for Dr. Carter to teach him how to do it himself and give him the supplies then for him to get them at General. That way it saves that money for when he’s in a crisis like he is now. He says he wants to talk to you but it hasn’t done him any good. Three packs have figured out his living hell it for them to send him back to it. Things have gotten really bad each time the council came after he returned home. Never once did they speak to him directly. He was  warned  that if the council shows again he won’t be allowed to continue in the warrior program.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need to get Jamie started but I also want you to keep talking. Tell me anything you need me to know. I’m listening.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opens his eyes, looking at me briefly as I run hand through his hair as I direct Jamie back to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You using the link will be a good distraction for him as well but you need to be careful or you’ll end up taking on his pain.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods again before I walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“All right Mr. Jamison. You’re looking really nervous right now. Have you ever had stitches before ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We figured as much. That’s why they called me. So, this is what happens. Ang’s going to rinse  it  out with abination of lidocaine  , steroids ,  antibiotics and saline. After that will be the shots. There’s a lot of them because you need multipleyers  of  stitches. While she’s doing the shots, since this is your first time, Patrick is going to hold your head still while I hold your hands. They do burn and I don’t  expect  you to hold it in but you can’t fight either. You can kick your feet as long as you’re not pushing your body off the table. Squeezing my hands helps quite a bit and you’re allowed to yelp, cry. scream ow, I’ve even had wolves beg us to stop but  we  can’t until it’s done. Most have found it easier to handle with their eyes closed, especially if you’ve had a hard time with shots in the past. Once those are done you will have about fifteen minutes before Ang starts stitching it up. She is going to move fast through the shots. It only takes a minute or two to get all theyers done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head but doesn’t look any morefortable when heys down. He breezes through the rinse and the first few shots  but  as Ang moves through the multitude of shots he starts whining hard as the burn catches up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Squeeze my hands Jamie. You’re doing very well for your first time! Breathe with my count.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I go through the slow count I use when wolves are brinking on a panic attack which calms him enough that he doesn’t start screaming on me. I hold  my  hand out to him and help him sit up while the numbing medication takes  effect .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to get Cole something to eat if you think you can help him out, Alpha. I’d like to see if he can get Luna’s chicken soup down without cramping when it’s warm.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head and invite Jamie toe with me. He takes the stool he was sitting in before  as  I try to wake Cole back up. He reacts a little better, squeezing down on my hand hard as he opens his eyes. I start running my hand through his hair as his eyes meet mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry. I know you just fell back to sleep but Dr. Pierce would like to try getting you to eat again. Are you hungry ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods as Jamie starts to speak for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He usually stays hungry the entire time he’s in the hospital. Despite having the feeding tube harshly shoved inside him they hardly use it and when  they  did, it would cause him a lot of pain. He tends to lose quite a bit of weight also.”</p>
