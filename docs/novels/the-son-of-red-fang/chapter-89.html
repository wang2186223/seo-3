                <p>“  I’m  not certain if we have even found all of his injuries yet but what we have found is quite distressing. It’s very important that the information I give your remains confidential until I’m able to make a move on him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Is  that why you’re refusing to use his name?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. He’s been to three packs. All three figured out his secret. All three sent him home. I believe but I haven’t been able to confirm that he talked  to  them. Told them what was going on and they still sent him home.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What makes you believe that he talked?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Every time I ask him to talk to me, even his friend was begging him to talk, his only response is that it doesn’t help. That no one can help him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So he’s been burned by several packs. That’s unfortunate and disturbing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Not simply burned Xavier. The council showed up and started poking around a month after he got home. They never talked to him directly so he doesn’t know why they were there but I was able to infer from information given by his friend that his beatings stopped while the council was there before they increased for several months after they left.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So he’s corrting the council’s visit with him talking about the abuse.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Not just that. He’s been told by his father that if the counciles poking around again that he will be withdrawn from the program. I can only imagine the break he must be getting when he’s away from his home pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not much of a break depending on which packs he’s going to,pared to who’s abusing him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“His father and lead alpha are one in the same.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Now you really have my attention, Demetri. Who is this young man?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I told you I’m not doing that to him. He has no trust as it is and it’s taken  six  hours just to start breaking the panic induced asthma cycle. He has no idea that I’m even talking to you. What I need is information on the most currentws pertaining to an adult that  is  actively being abused. Thest time I tried to pull an adult from their pack without a protection order ,  at twenty–one years old, she was too old. Fortunately she was willing to go into sanctuary status but thews seem to change every year.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t think he’ll agree to sanctuary status? That is by far the best way to protect him from his father. Simply pulling him from the pack  or  ,  knowing you, not allowing him to go home, doesn’t mean his father can’te get him. That’s why the protection orders are there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But if I convince him to stay when everyone else heads home I may have a better chance at convincing him that the protection orders are real. That  I  can actually help him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I admire your passion Demetri. He must be really bad off if you’re calling me less than a day after he arrives. You know, even without his name and pack, I need to know what you’re dealing with to get the correct information from the council.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve got pictures that are time stamped. When I told him I wanted to take them it was initially as part of the physical and it still is, but now that I’ve seen the extent of his injuries it’s more than that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s understandable.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He was used of raping his future luna and received physical punishment for that usation three days ago.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So we’re looking at some time Saturday?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I believe  so .”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“From what I’ve been able to gather, using multiple sources, he was grabbed in a submission hold and was being taken to the training room  when   he  tried  to  run but failed and ended up with over a dozen kicks to his abdomen.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Can you send the pictures you took  as  you talk?”</p>
