                <p>I don’t think they trusted him fully until they were injured in a training exercise and they got stuck in the hospital all night. Alpha never called the nursery center to inform them or us of the situation. Cole took it upon himself to get my siblings from the nursery and walk them home. He cooked all of us  dinner  and insisted on everyone taking baths. He was really torn about that one. He knew that mom and dad bathed them every night before bed but he was dann near in a panic attack just thinking about bathing them. I tried to convince him that it was okay for them to skip one bath. It was really hard because I had never seen him that way. He kept insisting that keeping them to their normal schedule would help them sleep, so I told him I would stay with him and  help  him. I didn’t know how much help I could provide but if it calmed his nerves about caring for them I was willing to be there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How old were all of you when he was there?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole was eighteen, I was fifteen, Caitlyn was five, Brittany was three and Jeramy was one.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Quite a bit of space between you and Caitlyn.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ I  was a rape baby.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.” I’m taken aback by how calmly he said it, as if it wasn’t that big of a deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha Redmen has some fucked upws that still allow women to be abused. Twenty–five percent of pups born there are from sanctioned rape. Half of those pups grow up without their biological dad, but alpha gives the she–wolves that keep their pup a monthly allowance so they aren’t as financially burdened and the pup stays in the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was five when mom met her fated mate. He’s the only dad I’ve ever known and he’s good to me. Loves me like my siblings so I don’t know anything different anymore but it took mom a long time to have sex with him. She hadn’t been with anyone before my bio dad and no matter how hard she tried to break up with him he refused to leave. It was only when she proved to alpha that she was three months pregnant that he stopped bio from the weekly rapes. That’s when Alpha Redmen started sending her money and it will stop in a few months when I turn twenty–one. He takes care of me better than Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks over af Cole as Ang cleans up the garbage left from the stitches. I follow his gaze  as   I  hear the soft whimpersing from across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m going to hook him up with some form for that ng–tube. Do you want to try and calm him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give her a nod as I help Jamie get off the bed. We head over to Cole and Jamie takes a seat on the stool still by the bed. I slide my hand again into Cole’s as I start rubbing his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey Cole. Are you okay?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hungry.” I barely hear him squeak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We figured as much. Ang’s warming up some form. We’re going to use the tube so you can sleep through it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezes my hand hard as he whines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please no….. tube…. feeds….. hurt….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s gasping hard again as his anxiety stirs. I lean down into him  as   I  speak hoping that my closeness will give himfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I promise the tube was ced properly. There will be no pain.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I finish speaking Ang has hung a decent sized portion of the form and connected it to the feeding tube. It only takes a few seconds for him to  feel  the warmth of the form drifting through the tube. He stiffens up badly as his body begins to shake .  I’m rmed by the sudden change in his demeanor towards the tube. He handled having the/tube ced a lot better than this feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay Cole. Concentrate on what you feel. I promise you there’s no pain with this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slows his movements enough for me to know he’s testing my word, he wants it to be true .   As  the level of form falls I can feel him start to rx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Are  you starting to feel better now ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask him gently. He nods his head slowly as his  eyes  start to ze over and his eyelids start to droop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Don’t  fight the sleep Cole ,   you   need  it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly his body rxes as his eyes fully close and his hand finally releases me from his grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hopefully this willst you a bit longer than that  soup .”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ I  liked… the soup.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckle softly  as  I smile. “We were hoping you would. I’ll be back in two hours to help you eat more,  Get  some sleep.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doesn’t take long to drift off again as  he’s bforted by the warm form gently filling his belly. I look at Jamison</p>
                
                
                
                <p>as  my  own  stomach  growls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How about  we  go get some lunch and  take  it back to my office ?  I’d like to get you to finish up your stories about Cole and the Red Fang  pack  .  ”  I  exin  as we head out the door.</p>
