                <p>I pull my maic master keycard from my pocket and swipe it against the reader  granting   me   immediate  ess to the room just as Patrick, Parker and Dominice bounding up the stairs.  I  have  no   idea   where  they were but I’m grateful for their quick arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all rush in just in time to take the feet out from under Richard. Unfortunately, he was able  to bplete  his blow to Jamie’s left eye before hended on his face. I leave Parker kneeling on top of  Richard’s  iling, cursing body as I intercept Das’s attempt to kick Jamie in the groin with a harsh kick to the back of his knees. I grab Das’s arm preventing him from hitting the bed. Patrick quickly grabs him in a  painful  submission hold, keeping him on his knees giving me the freedom needed to check on Jamie. It’s only as  I  approach Jamie that Andrew releases him from his grasp. My alpha aura is zing as the young man copses to his knees, exhausted and bleeding heavily from his nose and mouth with his hands tied behind his back. I wrap my arm across his chest as he falls holding him up as I use my knife to cut the cloth binding his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Put your hands out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Imand, earning a startled yelp from Jamie as he blindly puts his arms out in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Jamie. It’s difficult to mask my alpha when I’m this angry. You’ve done nothing wrong.  I’m  going to lower you slowly until your hands touch the ground. Damian had the forethought to get Jessa and the ambnce over here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can Iy down, please?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spot Lucas finally stepping into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lucas, go grab a towel from the bathroom, then take Parker’s ce holding Richard in submission. Parker,  I  understand you aced Field Medic Training? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want you with Jamie. Help Damian and Jessa get Jamie stable enough for transport to the medical wing. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nice thing about my rtionship with my pack is they know when they’re in trouble sò, unlike Jamie, my alpha aura doesn’t bother them as much when I call for their help in a bad situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As  Lucas and Parker make the exchange I demanded, I turn my attention to Andrew, who’s still standing stiffly in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Go stand in front of Dominic with your hands behind your back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He submits easily, ducking his head and eyes towards the ground as he walks away. Listening  to   Jamie’s  painful and terrified yelps as Parker tries to stop his bleeding only serves to anger me  further  .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘ Damian! What’s taking so  long?  ‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyell at my oldest through the link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘ Sorry dad. Jessa doesn’t use the ambnce much and had to find Dr. Plerce to get the key. We’re headed out the door now. Dr. Pierce is going to link Dr. Morrison so they can have everything ready when hees in.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell them I want him in the multi scanner.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Yes, sir.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you .  ‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl loudly as Ie out of the link interrupting Das and Richard’s argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Das and Richard. The two of you are a clear danger to your own pack members which means I  can’t  chance you in my territory. Lucas and Dominic. You will escort these two downstairs and assist the guards in transporting them to the cer. You will stay the night in jail tonight. You will have breakfast brought to you in the cer. I will call for each of you to be brought to me just before lunch. Two guards will bring you to my office where you will present to me your bare ass. You willy your chest across my desk, the guards will hold you in submission and you will receive ten full strength hits. You will then be led back to the dining hall where you will be allowed to put together a te of food and grab a drink before heading back to your room. You will remain in your room under trained guards until six at which time you are expected to have all your belongings packed and ready to go. You will ce your bags outside of your doors so my omega housekeepers can take them to the bus while you are escorted to the dining hall for dinner. Once you have your te, you will board the bus. The guards will stay with you for the entirety of the trip. There will be no breaks except to change drivers half–way through the trip. In addition to my own physical punishment and returning to Red Fang, I will be sending a detailed report of this attack along with the video footage that I get from the rec area and Jamison’s room to the council with the rmendation for immediate and permanent removal from the warrior prospect program and additional physical punishment to be given by Alpha Redmen.”</p>
