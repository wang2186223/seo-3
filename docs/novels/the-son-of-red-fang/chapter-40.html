                <p>I woke up in the hospital a weekter in Jacob’s arms. He was sleeping in the hospital bed with me. I remember being in pain but snuggling into his warmth and smell made it easier to handle. When he woke up, he was so gentle and kind. Doing everything he could tofort me.. Just like you, Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look into Lilly’s tear filled eyes as I continue my ginger touches along different parts of arousing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of her body, keeping it modest so it’sforting instead</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He exined the best he could that mom died before I woke up and that the rogue damaged my back in such a way that I couldn’t walk. He mentioned that the rogue raped both of us but I was too young to understand. He said that the rogue was on top of me when he got there. That he fought with and killed him before dad ever got there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad was pissed at Jacob when he grabbed me up off the ground and ran me to the hospital, leaving him and my brothers to get mom help. Jacob told me that he gave me blood and refused to leave when Dad, David and Donald were concentrating on my mom despite all of them being told she wasn’t going to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad even gave him permission to make decisions on my medical care. He agreed to an open checkbook but Jacob made the calls. Jacob moved into the hospital with me. He was the one to hold me during the painful cell regeneration therapy on my back. He was the one to go through the pain of having spinal cells removed from him to be duplicated in theb for use in that therapy. He bathed me, changed my diaper, and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>held me during those long nights that I wept for my mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He became the father my dad couldn’t bring himself to be. I never saw my father until I left the hospital six monthster.  I  was in a wheelchair because I still couldn’t walk but at least therapy had been a sess in mending my broken spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob continued to care for me once we got home. He taught me to walk, use the bathroom and how to dress myself again. After nine months of being inseparable my father got angry with the amount of time he was spending with me. They got into a huge fight. I only saw part of it as I ran away after seeing dad m Jacob’s face into the coffee table. The next night he was gone. I only saw him two more times after that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was three months after he left, on the one year anniversary of our attack, that dad came while I was crying after waking from a nightmare. For the first time in a year he tried to soothe my broken soul. He exined that Jacob left because he found his Luna and she had no male siblings to take on the Alpha role so Jacob moved into that pack, fourteen hours away, to be the alpha of the Red Star pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starteding at the same time every night, rubbing my back and talking calmly to me. I was five when he started pushing my nightgown up to my arms and rubbing my chest and belly. It didn’t hurt so I didn’t think anything of it. The first time I thought something was off was when my dad spread my legs open and started rubbing the front of my underwear. I whined when he did it ,  pulled my gown down and closed my legs. At first he was gentle with his chastising. He tapped my nose to get my attention and told me he was simply continuing the therapy that Jacob started with me. In order to properly use the bathroom he had to make sure I could feel everything properly.</p>
