                <p>(Patrick’s POV)</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It doesn’t take long to cross thend in between the dining hall and the medical wing of the pack house. Jamison’s walking has improved so Fe or worried about a concussion as Demetri is but the kid is still sporting a really nasty cut over his eye that’s still worth looking at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s been quiet the whole time walking, looking at the ground. He’s keeping pace with me but also staying a respectful two steps behind toe, which tells me I’m a higher rank than him. Something I’ll ask aboutter if Dr. Morrison doesn’t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Here.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak for the first time since leaving the dining hall as I open the door to the medical wing. I’m not much of a talker either ,  at least not with those I’ve just met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He steps inside ahead of me but stops about four feet away waiting for me to show the way. We get about halfway down the hall when I spot Dr. Pierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang, are you busy?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“A little Pat but how can I help you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri sent me over here with Jamison. He wants Jamie checked over. He was in a nasty fight with his pack mate, Das. He’s the worst of the four that got into it. He’s also wanting to check on Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t think Cole had any friends in his pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She states as we’ve walked closer to the door she’s getting ready to enter. He’s quiet and submissive when he speaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole isn’t allowed to have friends but that doesn’t stop me from caring about him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s sad to hear. This is his room. He’s hit the call button so I got Dr. Morrison to take Jessa’sst appointment for the day so I can check on  him  .  There’s another bed in here that I can use to examine you so you cane in. Just keep it quiet as we’re trying to keep stimulus at a minimum. We’re struggling to break the anxiety cycle that’s fueling his asthma. He’s worse than Damian at this point Pat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head slowly  as   we  step into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s your name  again  ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamison but I prefer Jamie . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“All right Jamie. I need you to head to the bathroom on the right side of the room. Wash the blood from your face and hands so I can see the extent of your injuries. When youe out,  take  your shirt off and sit on the bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He heads quietly to the bathroom while Ang heads to Cole. I watch her lean over him and speak directly into his ear. It seems he’s asking for help using the bathroom as his hand keeps pointing at the container hanging off the side of his bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She  walks over  to the curtain and draws it closed. It takes several minutes but it’s not long before Ang is bringing a container to the bathroom to dump  as  Jamie leaves. We make our way to the bed at the same time from opposite directions as Dr. Pierce washes her hands before putting gloves on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*So getting into a fight on your first day here? You know that’s the fastest way to get disqualified from the program, yes?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes ma’am.” The  young  man sighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How old are you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Twenty.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ And your rank ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Delta”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Okay. So, deviously you’ve been through the usual statsdard physicals and ones after injury as ‘* ***</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yer ma’am. It’s not my first time in a fight with Bes  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that’s a be of muckvent is wind e</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What I like to do is start with the lesser injured areas and work to the harder ones to handle  . Patrick, can you link with Demetri? immediately sting he’s going to need stitches and he’s better at distracting than you are</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I call on my wolf to form a link with Demetri. I’m relieved to find out that he was headed over to Cole’s room as we’re speaking to check on hits. Although it’s not what he wanted, Jamie being in the same room makes things a bit easier on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I’m speaking to Demetri I can hear Ang instructing Jamison on what she needs him to do. First examining his hands before looking at his chest and abdomen. His cooperation with Dr. Pierce ispletely opposite from what little I saw of Cole,</p>
