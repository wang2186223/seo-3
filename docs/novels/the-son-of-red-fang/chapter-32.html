                <p>Her body stiffens as she whimpers again as my pressure gently increases.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Lock your link to me.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I encourage her through the link. I know she’s done it when I feel her overwhelming anxiety towards the change in intimacy that I’ve take with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Stay with me Lilly. I’m not going to hurt you,‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reassure her through the link as I take her a step further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently slide my finger to her entrance, gently running the tip along the outer edge. She whimpers hard with uncertainty, I haven’t touched her like this since my epic failure to control my wolf the first time we had sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had waited two years before having the mate’s union ceremony that recognized Lillian as my luna and another year after the union ceremony to finish the mating bond. It’s unusual for fated mates, especially an alpha and luna to wait so long beforepleting the bond, so my wolf was eager to have his mate and her wolf was in heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She–wolves go through both the human menses and the wolf’s three week heat cycle. It’s during the wolf’s heat cycle that you are ny percent certain to get her pregnant. She can get pregnant during the human cycle but it tends to take longer with less certainty. Either cycle between two werewolves will produce a werewolf. We both wanted children and she swore that she was ready,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wolf took control and paid no attention to the fact that she had been sexually abused for ten years by her alpha father. By the  time  the tie released and my wolf retreated, satisfied he had done his job, Lilly was left a terrified, sobbing mess. I had lost control of him so badly that i didn’t have a clue what he had done to her with my body. So for twenty years I have yed it safe and stayed within herfort zone, feeling that it was the least I could do after convincing myself that I had raped her that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’ve stayed away from the simple pleasures of rubbing her clit, fingering her and sucking on her cunt because that was what I know her father did to her. At least that’s my understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The difference is he trained her, through physical pain, to hate such contact with her body. She has never detailed to me what happened when he touched her. All she’s ever said was that his hand between her legs brought her unbearable pain. So I’ve only indulged in those simple pleasures a handful of times at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet there’s something about today, my instincts about the young man being verified and my luna seeking me out, desiring apletely different means offort after seeing the young man’s bruised abdomen that’s telling me, begging me, screaming at me to challenge her the way I have refused to challenge her for twenty years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s as her body finally rxes under my gentle touch that I add more pressure, increasing the friction against her sensitive clit. She shifts ufortably beneath my body as a sensation she’s rarely felt starts to invade her. The beauty of having her lock into the link is being able to simply think what I wish to say and she’ll hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I know you’re not used to this as I’ve been afraid of hurting you again for all these years. I’m not going to hurt you Lilly. I want you to experience the same pleasure I do when your hands are on me. Rx with me darling. It’s me and me alone.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My speed increases, changing the way it feels again. I’m between her legs, keeping her from closing up on me but I’mying to one side of her so I can see her face as I slow my speed and introduce one of several obstacles she struggles with during forey and sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I press my middle finger against the skin between her slit again and gently, slowly slide it to her entrance again stopping just barely inside. Her body is stiff and her breathing ragged as she tries to cope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx Lilly.” I whisper in her ear hoping that the sound of my voice will soothe her as I slide my finger down inside her. She gasps hard as she struggles not to fight against me. I capture her lips with mine as I slowly develop a gentle rhythm. I pull my lips from hers as I continue my gentle fingering of her entrance. Her breathing has rxed and she’s finally enjoying what I should have done to her so many years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, look at me.</p>
