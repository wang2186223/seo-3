                <p>“Try to rx with me Cole. I just want to help as you’re struggling really bad right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head slowly as I try to force myself to cooperate, 1 fail miserably, letting out a soft high pitched whine that I’ve had since childhood. I’ve learned over the years that as I’ve gotten older only certain people, mostly the doctors, can even hear such a distressing whine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 step away from the alpha as he steps closer to me, whining as I do, just to be stopped by Damian’s grasp. I notice Damian making eye contact with his dad suddenly before talking with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s been making that weird little whine a lot and he’s struggling to breathe bad enough that he’s not talking.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You can actually hear it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Demetri sounds shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, but I’ve never heard a whine like that. Have you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s notmon for an adult to have that whine, but I have heard it plenty when I was an intern at the hospital during my pediatric rotation. Pups experiencing high levels of distress and pain will make that sound at regr intervals. Usually only parents and those naturally inclined to the medical field can hear it. I believe it’s a distress signal that pups use tomunicate that they are hurt without letting potential threats know that they’re vulnerable.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian looks as shocked as I feel. An alpha that can hear my distress? I’m taken back enough that Alpha Demetri moves in from the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hang on to him Damian. Don’t move Cole. I am a doctor. I’m just not licensed to practice anymore. Nothing I do is going to hurt you. It’s very important that you follow my directions. It’s a lot to ask of you but I need you to trust me enough to submit to me. Don’t fight me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m wheezing hard as my panic consumes my every thought. I raise my hand to Damian’s arm in an attempt to grab his shirt but I’m stopped by alpha’s hand. I try to pull away but he grabs my hand instead. I can’t help but yelp as my panic and pain rise. Once again, I’m sounding like a strangled dog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Squeeze Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is firm and demanding as my struggle for air worsens, I can do nothing but obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, ce his other hand on my forearm so I’ve got good support of him while I check his breathing. Dr. Morrison should be here soon with a transport chair. Cole, don’t try to change your breathing pattern. Breathing too deep may cause you a lot of pain. Just breathe as is mostfortable.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel him ce the stethoscope on my back moving it to different locations, listening to me breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So, you’re asthmatic?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But you didn’t bring your medication for that either?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I….. tried.” I manage to croak out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You tried? Are you saying that you packed them and someone took them from your bag?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod as my father has never liked me on medication even though I’ve been asthmatic since I was a baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Tell…. Doc tor…. Car… ter… I’m…in…. a…. cy…. cle.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s a fight to get the sentence out and I’m surprised that Alpha even understands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  A  cycle? You’re talking about a panic induced asthma attack?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as I squeeze down on his hand again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Fuck. Okay Cole. I’m going to call Dr. Pierce to see if she can get a hold of Dr. Carter so we can find out what he does for you. I can’t. guarantee that we’re going to do the same thing but it will give us a starting point. Damian, he’s out for at least a week. I’m sorry Cole but with this type of asthma attack I have to admit you to the hospital wing until we get it under control. How long have you been like this ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Mid….. mid….</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  hang my head as my struggle for air   is to the point that I can’t get the word out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Midnight?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as Alpha seems to have heard what I’m trying to say. He pulls out his phone, touching the screen in several ces.  I  can hear it ring before a female voicees over the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri? I thought we were going to meet in your office shortly? ”</p>
