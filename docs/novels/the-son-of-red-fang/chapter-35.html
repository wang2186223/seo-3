                <p>It’s as I’m sucking on her nipple, swapping sides every minute or two, that I arch my back so my hardness starts rubbing the softness between her legs. Keeping it familiar, I start rubbing slowly. First her inner thighs before grazing her slit without entering. It’s as my pressure increntess that her body freezes and I can feel the anxiety building through the link. I wrap my arms around Lilly as Imand her mouth’s attention. She rxes in my hold slightly as I continue my slow grinding against her southern lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s when she rxespletely in my arms again that I trail kisses to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx with me Lilly. ept whatever I decide to do. I’mpletely locked into the link with you and I swear to you that nothing I do  will  hurt you. Focus on me and what you’re from me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper in her ear before going back to her mouthmanding her attention again. I slow my grind against her as my mouth trails slowly down her body again. She’s gone still and stiff, just like the other times I attempted to do this with her. I’m very predictable so I know she understands what’sing, she’s just never told me why it makes her so ufortable when physically she’s very responsive to every touch, every lick, every bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop briefly and give each nipple a delicate suck before trailing further south to her navel. I stop at her abdomen, trying to give her time to follow my trail. It’s when I can barely feel what I’m doing to her that I lightly nip her skin before soothing it with a lick. I know I have her back on me when I can feel everything, her thoughts, her pleasure and her pain. After several minutes I trail to my final destination, the one I rarely get to, her southern lips between her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently rub her inner thighs encouraging her to  rx  and open up to me. I can feel her anxiety building but so far she’s still calm .  I start with kisses along her inner thighs before gently rubbing the outside of her slit. She shifts slightly with the contact but doesn’t fight it.  I  can feel through the link that she’s struggling, so I follow my instincts on what I feel she truly needs and pause my progress until she seems a bit more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly start putting enough pressure on my middle finger to slowly push into her slit, smiling when I feel her juices coating my finger. Her breath catches briefly but I can feel through the link that she is trying hard to stay 100 percent focused on me. Something I’ve never required her to do before, so far, it seems to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I change my fingers to my forefinger and thumb ,  keeping the same gentle pressure and speed as I slowly introduce spreading her lips apart. The closer I get to what I want her to experience the harder it bes for her, but I know she needs this. She needed this a long time ago. It’s as I drag my fingers up toward her sensitive nub that I slow down until I stop at the top, I slowly spread her lips until I can see the sensitive piece of flesh between my fingers. I duck my head down and in one quick motion, run my tongue over her clit. She startles badly but doesn’t fight. I think the fighting against this was trained painfully out of her a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please don’t bite me . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear a desperate whisper escape from within her. A clue that I could finally work with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“There will be no pain, at all from here on Lilly. Lots of pressure but I promise no pain. I need you to focus on what you feel, baby.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  speak quietly trying to reassure her of the rest of the venture we’re on. Once she rxes a little, I duck down into her again, gently using my tongue to flick her clit  as  my fingers hold her lips open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She manages this well until I introduce a single finger into her entrance. She stiffens badly at the new intrusion, a soft whimpering escapes from within her before she starts rxing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can feel her pleasure through the bond as well as the link but her apprehension blocks her from fully enjoying it. I kiss on her thighs again  as  I gently rub the inside of her entrance ;  wanting her to rx before moving into the next part.</p>
