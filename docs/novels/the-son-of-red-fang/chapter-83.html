                <p>“Cole, I need you to get your legs up on the bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He responds slowly, turning his body and lifting his legs at the same time. He manages to get his feet on the bed when Ang knocks and opens the door causing one of the severest fear responses I have seen in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It takes everything I have to keep Cole from leaping off the bed, his arms iling erratically as he yelps in terror from my hold on him. Ang and  I  are in shock at such a terrifying response when he had been doing so well with us. I had nearly forgotten Jamie was even there until I hear his voice in a way  I  could have never imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha Cole, look at me! ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is loud, sharp andmanding attention as his hands are upon Cole’s wrists ,  crossed and gently held against Cole’s chest. Light, persistent whimpers intertwine with the sound of his wheezing as he struggles to recover from his fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole please. I love you and trust you without hesitation. You are  as  much my brother as Jeremy .  I know you’re scared and goddess knows that you have every right to be but I need you to trust me. This alpha isn’t out to hurt you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole ispletely still as they look at each other, I can see Ang approaching quietly with a syringe in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘What is it?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask sternly, cross at the very idea of what I think she wants to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Five milligrams of Valium. That was a dangerous reaction to something as simple as meing in the door.’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No? Demetri he damn near hurt you and most certainly would have hurt himself if you weren’t here to restrain him. Every wolf is afraid at some level to be in the hospital but he’s out of control.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s not afraid, Ang.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How the hell can you say he’s not afraid?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl through the link as she interrupts me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘He’s not simply afraid, Ang, he’s terrified right now! He is above and beyond anything that I have ever worked with. I have found and helped over two dozen wolves, men and women equally, who had been abused or were being abused in their home pack, get out. As soon as I figured it out and confronted them, told them I could help them, they opened up to me. Begged me to help them after goddess knows how many packs looked the other way. Cole is so far beyond the level of abuse those others suffered and yet he refuses to talk. He has no ability to trust, to believe that I can help him and so much as begged me not to punish him when I found the burn on his leg and asked about it. I don’t care about what just happened. You will not medicate him without his knowledge. Now go reduce the amount to one milligram and I will let you know when you can  give  that and the vicoprofen.‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns away from me and heads back to the cab. As an alpha in her own right she can question my authority and doesn’t have to submit to my demands, yet the closeness we have has fostered a level of trust that all alphas should have with their pack members. I bring my attention back to Cole and Jamie as I feel Jamie slowly release Cole’s wrists. Cole remainspletely still even after Jamie has taken a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole please rx.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie’s voice is soft and gentle as he slowly covers Cole’s eyes with his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You know I can’t look at you when your  eyes  are darting everywhere. Please  Cole , trust me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How…. can you be…. so willing…… to trust him….. You don’t…. know  him  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The same way you’re terrified of him without knowing him All I know is what I see Cole. I see an alpha who has defended you, protected you and helped you without knowing you ever since you got off that busst night. He has been nothing but gentle and kind, has he not? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel his body shake as he starts to sob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry alpha….. Dr.Carter is right….. I can’t control….. the  fear …. I need to be…. tied. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ No you don’t Cole.”</p>
