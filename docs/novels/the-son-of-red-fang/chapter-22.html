                <p>“Dr. Carter told me that you’re very sensitive to the medication he gives you. That, when it’s given in the IV it tends to burn badly and the side effects are numerous when given too quickly so the Valium is going first over about thirty seconds instead of five and I’m putting the steroids- on a feeder. Are you familiar with an IV feeder?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally let go of the beta’s hand to form a thumbs down for no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I didn’t think so. Alex mentioned that your ess to medical care is limited. Your father gives each wolf a budget they’re allowed to use during the year and yours tends to be on the low side for an alpha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head against the alpha’s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alex said his normal therapy for these attacks is 2mg of Klonopin, we’ve given you 1mg of Ativan so far. He also gives you 10mg of Valium, not Xanax, and arge starter dose of steroids. Valium and 500mg of the steroids are given as intramuscr shots, single doses.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startle badly when the beta lets out an unexpected yelp and I hear the alpha growl softly near my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I take it neither of you are strangers to the steroid injections?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Pierce speaks lightly of their reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How did you manage to take five units of that stuff in a single shot?” Alpha Demetri asks near my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why something so harsh, Ang?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alex said that Cole’s medical care tends to exceed what his father allows so they cut costs where they can. It takes too long and too many people to get an IV going on him so they don’t. They give him one to threerge doses of steroids IM depending on how his breathing improves after each one, then put him on the pills at a higher dose then what he’s regrly on. But we’re not going to do that Cole. Now that I’ve got a good IV line taped down on you I’m going to give you 2mg of Valium and I’m cutting down the steroids. I’m going to put 200mg on a feeder so that it takes an hour to give you the full dose. The steroids will be repeated at that dose every six hours for six doses and I will reassess the next phase of treatment aiming for getting you out of here once we get to that point. Unless he wants you to stay, you should be good to get up Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“If you don’t need me anymore I’m going to head back out to the track and observe the rest of his pack. Don’t forget members of the Blue Moon pack arrive today around four so we may have to end your punishment early. With how slow some of these wolves are moving you’d think they were the ones who couldn’t breathe.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha chuckles lightly before responding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s fine Patrick and thank you for your help. We will meet during dinner so I can exin things a little better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sounds like a n. See you then boss.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s as the beta leaves that Alpha Demetri starts to move around so he could get up. I can’t exin my sudden desire for him to stay close but my reaction surprises us both. Without thinking I grab the side of his shirt causing him to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, what’s wrong?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please….. stay…. I’m….. scared….. I’m….. sorry….. I’m….. weak…..”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>}</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heys back down with me as Dr. Piercees over with the medication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Being scared doesn’t make you weak Cole. Everyone experiences fear. I will stay until you’re asleep. Would you like that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, I’ll stay a while longer .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reassures me as he gently starts running his fingers through my hair again. I’ve never before been able to rx under an alpha’s  touch  but there’s something different about Alpha Demetri.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel the Ativan starting to kick in as my mind is no longer racing with all my fears of everything going on around me. Dr. Pierce takes  my  hand in hers as she starts the Valium. I whine loudly and draw my arm back as the burn of the medication hits me but instead of being insulted for my weakness to tolerate pain Dr. Pierce simply slows down even more. The effects of the Valiumbined with the Ativan are almost immediate and I barely register her giving me a second drug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>????</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is Vicoprofen. It’s Motrin mixed with a little hydrocodone to help with your pain. It will make you sleepy but that’s the biggest side effect.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as I allow the medication to take hold of me. I’mpletely exhausted and for the first time that I can remember I actually feel safe in the arms of this stranger, this alpha. I bring my head towards him,ying my forehead on his chest as my breathing finally seems to be easing up. It’s as my body is rxing that I hear his voice again, soft against my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not going to push you to talk to me but I do feel it’s important for you to understand that I can help you if you’re in danger back at your home pack. You have to ask for help though. It’s obvious you are medically neglected but because you’re an adult I can’t just take you from your home. You must tell me that your life is in danger, that you need protection in order for me to help you. I promise you, I can help you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those are thest words I hear as I let the medication pull me into the deep sleep I need.</p>
