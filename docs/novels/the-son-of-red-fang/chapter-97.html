                <p>“Double physical punishment?” Richard exims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who do you think you are to order such a punishment?” Das chimes in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And what about Andrew? He’s the one that held him down once he was able to get a hold of the pathetic worm.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Andrew will receive a slightly lighter punishment as these punishments are based on what I saw when I walked in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick and Dominic have switched ces and I approach Andrew, who now has Patrick holding him in. submission. Out of the three, he’s the only one that looks even remotely ashamed of his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How long?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice is clipped and stern leaving no room for questioning my mood with him. Andrew looks up towards my face but not directly in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Excuse me, sir. I don’t understand.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is soft and submissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How long were you holding him while they pounded on him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not certain. Ten, maybe fifteen minutes.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This was obviously nned. The question is, why?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“They felt like I ratted them out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look towards Jamie as Parker stands and walks towards the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why would they think you ratted them out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Because I spoke with you first. I told you the truth before they could formte a n to get themselves out of trouble. I tried to remind them that you have cameras and won’t take any of us at our word alone but there’s no talking any sense into those two.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie has started slurring his words, raising my concern for him even more. I can hear Andrew cursing under his breath at the reminder of the security cameras and the fact that I research before I punish. Jamie yelps again as Parkerys an ice pack wrapped in a wet cloth across his eyes. It’s only secondster that I hear two sets of footsteps and the familiar voice of Damian instructing Jessa on which room to go to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s nice to see you feeling better, Jessa. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She responds quietly as she kneels in front of Jamie. Parker has managed to keep him sitting upright despite his desire toy down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian sets the medical bag down between Jessa and Parker allowing my best medic and my youngest doctor to work on Jamie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parker pulls out arge, thick absorbent mat that Damian helps Jamie move onto despite his quickly swelling eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What happened?” Jessa speaks softly towards Jamie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I got jumped.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry to hear that. What’s your name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamison, but I prefer Jamie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“All right Jamie. My name is Jessa. I’m a nurse practitioner here and I’m going to clean you up before trying to move you to the wing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head slowly as he starts panting heavily through his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, I want you beside Jamie. Make sure he doesn’t fall over. Parker, I need two bottles of saline, the soft disposable towels and the silver nitrate sticks pulled out. I may need to cauterize his heavy bleeders since it’s not stopping on its own.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rx slightly as I listen to Jessa take over Jamie’s care. I owe her my son’s life and the life of his two friends, Parker and Celine. She saved their lives three years ago. She had only been in my territory two weeks when Damian crashed my car into a tree. It was that day that I learned I had been gifted with two doctors that I could trust absolutely as they have proven to me multiple times their unquestionable judgment when ites to caring properly for my pack. Although I deeply care for the doctor that cared for my family growing up, I do feel that Dr. Morrison isn’t quite as persistent as she needs to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turn my attention back to Andrew as I hear all of them shifting ufortably from the pain of the submission hold. “What exactly was the n the three of you cooked up? Knock Jamie out and me everything on him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“They just told me that if I held Jamie so he couldn’t fight back they’d get me off the hook for the fight at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lunch.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh as I hang my head shaking it slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The truth, Andrew, would have gotten you off.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you mean, sir? They said Jamie threw everyone but himself under the bus.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh as I run my hand through my hair, something I seem to be doing a lot today. I turn suddenly to face Das as Dominic’s growl has alerted me to his sudden fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You little worm…..”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before  he could finish his sentence I’m on top of him in two steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Submit! Fully, to your knees.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl as he struggles against my grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re only making this harder on yourself. I will not hesitate to add hits to your punishment.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally copses to his knees with his own growl, grumbling under his breath about Andrew’sck of punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just because I haven’t announced his punishment yet doesn’t mean he won’t be, Das. But, I don’t feel that it’s fair for him not to understand his mistake You may stand back up but if I have to put you in submission again you will receive twelve hits instead of ten.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s standing again before I finish. I look him in his eyes, challenging him to defy me again. For the first time since getting here, he submits, averting his eyes away from mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Better.” I clip as I walk back to Andrew. “I should have expected Das and Richard’s betrayal better than I did. That’s why I ultimately came back for him. Did you bother to link with Jamie to find out what he told me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You simply took their word for it, even though they had not had contact with him either.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand that they are both delta rank and you’re a gamma but that doesn’t make them rulers over you. The idea that the moon goddess punishes those who defy those of a higher rank was proven to be a myth a century ago. If Jamie’s story was truthful, and I have found no reason to doubt him, you would have returned to training status afterpleting your physical. I always interview everyone involved in a fight andpare their stories with security footage. The most urate ount of what happened, based on security footage, would ultimately determine who was actively assaulting versus who was defending themselves. Unfortunately, because you have actively participated in allowing a pack member to be attacked with no ability to defend himself you are now looking at simr penalties as the other two.” Andrew hangs his head with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You will be remaining in your room for the rest of your time here. I have pulled two delta level warriors from my border  and  they will remain guard over you until you leave. They will escort you to breakfast, you will get your te and return to your room. They will get you again before lunch and bring  you  to my office.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stop a moment as Andrew draws a sharp breath in and his body stiffens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You will also receive ten full strength hits. You will be allowed to keep your boxers on during the hits before you are taken to the dining hall for lunch. Your belongings are to be packed and set outside your room by the time you are taken to dinner at six. I will file a report with the council detailing the events that lead to your early removal from my run, something I do with all prospects that don’t make it the full six months. I will detail the punishment all of you have received but with you, I will not rmend any further action against you. Permanent removal from the program and additional physical punishment will be left to the sole discretion of the council and Alpha Redmen. However ,   I  have no tolerance for wolves who are so easily influenced into harming another. Your inability to stand on your own and refuse to engage in such brutality is too dangerous to have around my family and pack. Do you understand what’s going to happen over the next twenty–four hours ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s quiet and submissive with his head hung towards the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Das and Richard, do you understand the punishment you will receive ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A  soft ‘yes sir‘es from them as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Dominic and Lucas, the guards are downstairs to lead Das and Richard to the cer for the night. If the two of you create any issues while walking  over  there I will know about it and add strikes as deem necessary .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominic and Lucas push lightly on their necks to get them started and walk out  of   the</p>
