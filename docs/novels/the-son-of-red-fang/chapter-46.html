                <p>“She begged me to punish her when she realized she may have been raped. She’s told me for years that she wasn’t but I knew better. She begged to be punished because she thinks she lied to me. She thinks that she’s a whore, Ang. That she asked for this to happen to her. That somehow she wanted it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s at that moment that I find myself falling apart. It only takes Ang a moment toe around to the back of my desk and push me  up  off it. The only female best friend that I’ve kept close to me, dly epting her permanently into my pack three years ago, she wraps her arms around my neck. I graciously ept herfort as I try to figure out my next steps for Lilly. Ang runs her hand through my hair as I calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to take a look, get medication on the tears so it knits together properly and reduces the pain she’s in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod quietly as I look into the tray she brought. It looks to contain everything for a standard gyno exam with the addition of two syringes with medication. I look back at Ang, I trust her with Lilly but I’m hesitant as Lilly can’t handle that type of exam, neither physically or mentally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not going to be as difficult for her as you think.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as I pull myself from Ang’s hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“She was rtively calm when I stepped out here. I think thebination of Ativan and Vicodin has finally kicked in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lift myself from the chair and head into the bedroom quietly with Angie close behind. I kneel down on the floor beside Lilly gently brushing her hair to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly baby, Ang’s here. I need to get you on your back  so  she can help you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirs with a light whine before rolling to her back. She opens her eyes and looks at me tearfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Demetri. I’m so sorry I lied. I’m….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I interrupt her with a soft but passionate kiss before backing off. I look into her eyes running my fingers through her hair as I speak, my own tears falling slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This both changes everything yet nothing Lilly. You are my mate, my luna. You did not want nor did you ask for any of this to happen to you. It is in no way your fault. I love you and that will never change,”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrap my arms around her tightly as she cries. She yelps suddenly and  I  feel her legs draw up against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilly, it’s Ang. She needs to look baby, it’s okay.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can feel her tension and hesitation with the exam. I can’t say that I would want it either but I know it’s a necessity. I lean down to her ear, covering her chest and abdomen with mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand your hesitation Lilly. I know you’ve got to be in a lot of pain right now and having anything done in that area is difficult but you know Angie. She’s going to be very gentle with you. Rx your legs into a butterfly honey. I’m going to be right here with you the whole time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach behind me and gently rub her thigh gradually working my way to the inside. To my relief, she rxes with my touch and I’m able to guide her into a good position for Ang to check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you ever had a bad tie, Lilly? Rx with my touch. I always start with a small catheter that allows me to numb the inside .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No” Lilly manages to yelp as Ang starts on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Lilly. I promise this is the hardest part. Grab tight to Demetri’s shirt. Let him hold you close. It’s going to get  really   cold  in a minute. It tends to be ufortable for a few minutes but it does go away usually by the time I finish the exam.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We do as Ang encourages and hold each other tightly. I adjust my body so that the new mark she gave me is closest to her nose  as  the mix of our scents will be strongest at the location. For mates, that mix has a euphoric effect that reduces pain and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She startles and yelps hard a minuteter but handles everything else with only some soft whimpers. I’m grateful when even those die  off .  By</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my arms. the time Ang is done, Lilly has fallen asleep in</p>
