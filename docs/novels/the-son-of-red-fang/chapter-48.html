                <p>I  make  my way back to the medical wing as I promised Cole I would check on him before lunch. This time I’ve brought my own stethoscope from my office so I’m not borrowing someone else’s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I open the door quietly not wanting to startle the young man and step inside. I startle lightly as another hand I wasn’t expecting is keeping me from shutting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, I wasn’t expecting you toe until after lunch.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  watch my son shrug his shoulders as he joins me in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know it’s my first time training the prospects on my own but damn this Red Fang pack has a bunch of bickering cry babies. Most of them haven’t stoppedining since breakfast. It’s either bitching about Cole being the alpha’s favorite or how unfair their punishment is. I’m ready to send the whole lot of them home.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can’t help but smile and stifle a smallugh. My experience with Red Fang has left asting impression on me. Overall ,  they tend to be bzy  .  The only reason why the two surrounding packs, White Fang and White Moon have allied themselves with Red Fang is because of numbers. Red Fang is massive where White Fang and White Moon are a split pack ruled by brothers. To my knowledge, Red Fang doesn’t have a formal training program for the warriors that guard their borders, the three packs coborate on what each pack needs and agree upon a single training program for all of them. Based on the argument I heardst night it sounds as if another bordering  pack  has allied with them recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we get further into the room it’s easy to tell that Cole is still struggling. The young man is still heavily sedated but that doesn’t keep him from fighting. He’s whimpering loudly as he thrashes around fighting off some invisible assant. The nket we had  on  him is on the floor along with one of the pillows and his oxygen has been knockedpletely off his face. The heart monitor is going  crazy  making me wonder how long he’s been like this without Ang or I getting an alert on our phones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quicken my pace getting over to him, hopping up on the end of the bed near his feet. He immediately reacts to my presence as it’s hard to stifle my alpha aura during situations that require quick thinking and acting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His movements stiffen to the point that he’s barely moving, his hands are wing at the sheet. He’s trying to stifle his whimpers and crying but they are still easily heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian stops in front of Cole. It’s his first time seeing the young man’s chest. I can’t me him for his shocked expression and inability to move. The angry red cuts mix with the ck and blue bruises along his chest and it’s hard to see where a patch of normal looking skin resides on his abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grab hold of his hands as Cole’s fight suddenly renews. I’m on my hands and knees  over  top of him gently using my weight to still his movements before using my voice to soothe the frightened young man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Cole, I need you to wake up.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice is rtively gentle considering themanding tone I must use to reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need you to wake up. It’s just a bad dream. You’re in the medical wing at Crimson Dawn. No one is hurting you here. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stills his fightpletely but he’s still whining hard on top of his wheezing. I move one hand to the back of his head ,  the  base  of  my   palm  barely touching his neck and start a gentle rhythmic rub while his legs are pinned beneath me and his hands are held still by m him gently pull his hands but my grip is firm and keeps them still. He tries his legs as well ,  getting the same  results  .   His   breathi . he continues trying to free his hands. I can feel his panic growing as my grip remains firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I will let you go as soon as you show me control. I’m not hurting you. Listen to my voice, it will tell you who I am . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>an feel</p>

                <p>The young man continues to fight against my grip. I know why he would panic if he was tied but I restrained him earlier and he managed a lot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>better than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole” I try again to capture his attention but it again falls onto panicked ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Please… no…. tie….,  please … let… go….”</p>
