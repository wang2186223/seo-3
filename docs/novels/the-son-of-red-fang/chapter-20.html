                <p>He gently moves his arm so that it’s under my neck versus my head, guiding my head onto the pillow.  It’s   as   I’m  trying to rx with  him  that I hear two sets of footsteps approaching from behind. I tense up severely when I feel their presence behind me .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Demetri speaks softly as he runs his hand gently through my hair. I’ve closed my eyes again as I try desperately to find something positive to focus on to get myself away from the constant triggers  for  my anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I’ve got a different mask that I think will be a lot easier for you to wear. Just stay still as I put it on you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Pierce speaks softly before leaning over me and cing a soft foam lined  mask  against my face .  I  ce  my hand around her wrist  as  she holds the mask, allowing me to adjust to its presence before wrapping the strap around my head. She, too, starts ying with my hair. Seems like this pack uses touch a lot to calm others and, at least for me, I find it quiteforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you okay, Ang ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha’s voice is deep with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m fine Demetri.  As  scared as he is right now he has been nothing but gentle. He seems to have  a  very kind and gentle soul, very easy to work with once you understand him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can feel the beta’s presence behind me but he doesn’t speak or move. It seems that he’s simply waiting for his next set of instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole,  I  understand that getting an IV is very difficult for you. When I spoke to Dr. Carter, he said that he usually has to go for a deeper, more painful vein to get a good line on you. I don’t want to do this more than once as I don’t think your asthma can handle any more anxiety.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head to show my understanding  as  she moves the strap of the mask to the back of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri has done it before but I’m going to have him put you in a bear hug keeping you from moving your upper body. He’s also going to put one leg over yours to keep you from kicking. Patrick is going to hold your hand so you can’t pull away while I ce the needle.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  stiffen up with the instructions as I know it’s getting near. I’ve  never  been lucky enough to  get  a one time try and it’s done. The least  I’ve  ever had is three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to rx with me. The more you’re able to  rx  the quicker and easier it will be.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head  as  Alpha Demetri gently pulls me into his chest. I struggle to ept his closeness to me but he continues his gentleness as he restrains me. The arm under my neck curls around so it’s against my shoulders. The other arm, he ces on top of mine ,  which is draped around his side so the doctor can get to it. With Dr. Pierce’s help, he ces his  leg  over my waist and down my legs effectively locking them into ce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m frozen in fear.  I’ve  never allowed the highest ranked member of a pack get this close to me, let alone physically restrain me. My entire body is shaking now as I struggle to focus away from everything going on. I’m barely able to yelp as I feel two unfamiliar rough hands on mine. I try to pull away but I’m met with a harsh pull to straighten my arm back out. I can’t help but yelp at the unnecessary move, whimpering and fighting against alpha’s restraint of me when I can’t get away. I yelp again when Dr. Pierce and Alpha Demetri yell Patrick’s name at the same time before the alpha gets on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“For the level of hesitation he’s shown towards my involvement with him and the amount of anxiety, pain and simple inability to breathe he’s experiencing he’s been more cooperative the most the he–wolves that were born here. I will not tolerate unprovoked roughness simply because you don’t like the pack he’s from. Now act like my beta or I’ll call your son in to help me!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m  sorry  sir. It won’t happen again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It better not. Towards anyone. I know you try to y it cautious with the prospectsing in but it’s also important that you don’t judge the individual based on the pack’s history. Sometimes  you  just happen across the one that’s different. That’s deserving of your time and patience .  ”</p>
