                <p>I started asking my father about the prospect program when I was eighteen, the youngest that you can be epted into the program. My n was to use the program to find my mate. It’s amon method used to get into other alphas’ territories which is usually the best way to find her. My n, once I found her, is to join her pack if she has a decent alpha, or to run away to the human’s world and live peacefully among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a hard time and several beatings before he caved. I was just shy of my twenty-first birthday when he finally submitted the application to the council. I was epted into my first run, the Blue mountain pack about six hours south of Whitefield, New Hampshire six monthster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the dense forest thins out revealing a massiveplex much bigger than all the packs I’ve been to so far. The pack house is easily identifiable, as it’s always the first building anyone entering the territory by car will see. Theplex is well lit giving it the appearance of a small city illuminating the pack house against the moonlit sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pack house is four stories high with what appears to be a massive ground floor. It’spletely white withrge white pirs in the front behind a small set of stairs. Large, french style double doors are centered between bay windows with smaller double windows beside them. As the bus continues its trek through theplex I’m able to catch a glimpse of the backside of the house, it extends back nearly twice as far as it is wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look briefly at my watch and shake my head in silence. I knew today would be a long day as my father only signs me up for the packs that are farthest away but I certainly wasn’t expecting it to be nearly nine at night. Even with the early sunsets ofte January I wasn’t expecting it to be quite this dark, it didn’t help that the bus got ate start. With fourteen of the twenty-four prospects being brand new to the program and on their first trip out, they were eitherte getting to the bus or packed more than the bus could carry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though I find it overwhelming to meet new alphas, betas and deltas it doesn’tpare to the gut wrenching, stomach churning anxiety I experience when I find myself returning home. My only friend Jamie once asked me what I would do if I were given the opportunity to stay away from home. I have frequently pondered that question for over a year but still have no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I know is that years ago I vowed to find my mate and as long as she is residing in a pack better than mine, I would move in with her. If her pack honors the old tradition of the mate’s iming ceremony, I will request to have one as it’s the only way I know I can rid myself of the Redmen name. I will take hers instead. Neither she nor my children, if my father hasn’t ruined that for me too, will ever experience the hell that I have lived. They will never know my side of the family as they might as well be dead to me. It’s already been made very clear that I am nothing to them so ridding myself of them permanently shouldn’t make a big difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s the squealing brakes of the bus that pulls me from my thoughts as ites to a stop in front of arge apartmentplex. Based on my previous trips with the prospect program it’s easy for me to guess that thisplex, less than a quarter mile west of the pack house, is the prospect’s dormitory. I’m immediately impressed as the grandeur of the apartmentplex is equal to that of the pack house, peaking my interest in how the rest of the pack lives. I can easily make out threerge, three story buildings. The interior lights of only one building, the one the bus parked in front of is lit. It too, has a double door entrance but instead of french doors they are ss and appear to be motion activated. There are also tons of windows exposing it to lots of natural light and air. The two upper floors have balconies while the ground floor has a small concrete patio. All of them have two outdoor chairs set off to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I continue my watch out the window my attention is soon drawn to several figures exiting the dormitory and heading towards the bus. It’s only a few secondster that the door to the bus opens and half the prospects stand, preparing to disembark. The driver holds out his hand, halting everyone’s movements before bowing slightly at the neck towards the young man that boards the bus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please, take a seat. It’s going to be a few minutes before you start getting off.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Das, a delta from my pack, doesn’t seem to take the young man seriously and remains standing while all the first timers sit back down. It’s easy to see why Das has an issue with his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looks young, too young to actually be in the program, let alone to lead it. He’s a tall, stocky, fair skinned young male with straight, ink ck hair and bright sky blue eyes. A strikingbination that I haven’t encountered before. Despite the respectful bow he received from the driver telling me he’s of a higher rank, he’s down on one knee while speaking quietly to the driver. I watch their interaction closely as the driver seems to be keeping eye contact with this young man, something I don’t see back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only takes a moment for Das to leave his seat and start down the aisle, acting as if he’s going to push his way by the man speaking to the driver. The young man stands to face the group just as Das stops in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Please head back to your seat and wait until instructions have been given.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Who are you to be ordering us around? We are grown warriors here and you’re nothing more than a pup.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Das is standing close to this upper ranked wolf I have the ability topare his size. He easily has two to three inches in height on Das, who is approximately five foot nine inches, making him at least six foot tall and his young appearance indicates that he’s not done growing. His eyes sh ck as his wolf briefly makes an appearance and his aura grows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Head back to your seat and wait for instructions.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growls out the directive, this time leaving no room for doubt that he’s an alpha. Fortunately, Das relents his hardheadedness and starts back to his seat as the driver stands and exits the bus. Secondster I can hear the under bus storage being opened and conversation between multiple people have started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Wee to Crimson Dawn.” The young man calls our attention back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I am Alpha Damian ck, son of Alpha Demetri ck, leader of this pack. I will be one of several trainers you will be interacting with during your stay here. Alpha Dominic Cullen is another.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Damian has started walking slowly towards the back of the bus as the footsteps of another is heard climbing aboard. A second young man appears at the front of the bus, standing calmly next to the driver’s seat. He appears older, of an appropriate age to be a prospect if he wanted to be. His physical appearance is almost opposite of Alpha ck though much moremon. He appears to be of a simr height to the first alpha but sports a buzz cut dirty blond hair with dark brown eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anxiety is growing at an rming rate as none of the previous packs had alphas greeting us as soon as we arrived. I can feel my eyes starting to dart around, looking for a quick exit that I know doesn’t exist while sitting on the bus. I’m finding it hard to focus on either one of these two alphas. Knowing that they are both alphas has me on edge as I struggle to keep the thoughts of them punishing me at bay.</p>
