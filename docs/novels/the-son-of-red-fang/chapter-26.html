                <p>I’m starting to get worried considering how his skin feels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“About an hour ago he was down to 100 degrees. If he gets below 99 then I’ll have to start warming the IV fluids and start trying to warm him that way. Let’s see if we can get him rolled over onto the pillow. I don’t like the effects this high amount of sedation is having on his heart rate so I want to track it on the monitor.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay Cole, we’re going to move you to the pillow so we can get these stickers on you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak softly near his ear but he doesn’t respond, it seems like he’s back to sleep again.  As  I try to roll him he wakes with a strangled yelp, both of his hands grabbing hold of the hand and arm that I’veid across his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try to grab his attention but this time he’s frantically trying to get away from me. He’s sedated enough that his eyes are closed, his movements are slow and his fight is weak. Even though he’s easily controlled I don’t like the uncontroble fear that his bodynguage ismunicating to me. His frantic need to pull my arm off of him so he can roll back onto his stomach bes even more disturbing when he resorts to curling his legs up to his stomach. It’s obvious he’s trying to protect himself, the question is, from what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ang and Lilly have taken a few steps away from us, giving me space to work with him without concern he may identally hurt them. I use the one thing to get his attention that I can think of. I give two quick, sharp clicks of my tongue near his ear, a technique I have used with many wolves who suffer with anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the high chance he’s never been introduced to such a technique he reacts exactly as I expected him to. His persistent whine stops and his movements freeze. I can feel his entire body shaking now and it’s without any doubt that he’s terrified of something that has happened consistently in the past, that he firmly believes is getting ready to happen to him now. I pull myself closer to him, holding him tighter as I do. I squeeze his hand gently  as  I start to talk to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to show me that you understand what I’m saying to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s only a few secondster that I feel the gentle but rhythmic squeeze of his hand on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you Cole. I can feel your squeeze. Now, I know you’re afraid. When Red General starts monitoring your heart, does something else happen? Do they put more than just the heart monitor stickers on you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head before attempting to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Heart… monitor ….  means ….  over… night…. or  more… I  stay …. tied…. no…. bathroom…. or eating…. just ….  tubes… they…. hurt…. Bad…. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m speechless as I watch a single tear escape from his eye. I look at Ang before making eye contact with Lilly. They both heard, they both understand what this young man has just said. I sigh lightly as I try to quickly figure out what I could possibly say to reassure this young he- wolf that nothing outside of what we exin to him is going to happen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I know this is huge as I’m certain getting this sick so soon in another pack’s territory isn’tmon for you. It’s very important that you  trust  us. I need you to listen and believe what we tell you. I promise you if Ang or I tell you we have no reason to restrain you then we are not going to restrain you. There’s absolutely no reason for  us  to tie you to the bed and put a catheter or ng–tube inside you. They are ufortable procedures that can be quite painful if done incorrectly. I assure you that nothing unnecessary like that is going to happen to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He startles hard when I use my thumb to wipe the tear from his eye, the steady grip on my hand easily conveys the true nature of his  fear . Ang  steps  back  over  gently touching his arm. She looks at me sadly when he chokes back a yelp, squeezing his legs even tighter against his abs .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I’m going to listen to your lungs before we roll you to your back. I do need to get your shirt off  of  you to get the stickers  in  the  proper  ce .  Are you okay with me cutting it? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He   nods  his head  slowly  as he flinches hard under Ang’s stethoscope.</p>
