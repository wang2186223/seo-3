                <p>I nod my head this time as I know I would never be able to get there on my own. He takes my hand as I force myself off the wall and attempt to walk with him. He ends up slowing down quite a bit as I stumble repeatedly trying to keep up with him. We stop several times along the  way  but eventually we make it to the dining hall in time for Alpha Demetri to make his morning announcements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I see no one here seems to be ready for training today.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts off sounding disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is your one time pass as it is a requirement that you show up to breakfast in a presentable manner ready for the day. It doesn’t matter what is scheduled for the day, whether it’s light training, heavy training, or your day off. I expect everyone in my pack, from my own four year old daughters to my omegas, to be dressed appropriately. Over half of you look like you just climbed out of bed.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s as he speaks that I try to focus on the crowd and from what  I  can make out it does indeed look like most of them simply managed to throw a shirt and pair of pants on, not much better than what I’ve managed. Some even look exactly like they did when they got off the bus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment I make eye contact with the alpha but don’t keep it as I can feel that he’s studying me. I’mpletely torn between begging for his help and running for the hills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ After breakfast, Alpha Dominic and Alpha Damian will take you back to the training dorms where each of you will take a shower and  get  properly dressed. For the moment properly dressed will simply mean clean clothes, something Cole seems to have been able to achieve despite looking likeplete hell.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look up to him again, causing him to smile gently when our eyes meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You don’t look like you’re doing very well, are you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head as I drop it down again concentrating hard on my breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong Cole? Meeting with the alpha got your asthma all screwed up. How the hell do you think you’re going to be a warrior if you can’t breathe right? No wonder he’s always in Alpha Redmen’s office.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yeah, nothing but a weak link for the pack. Have you noticed how many times he goes into the training room for private lessons with his dad just toe out looking like hell. All bruised up like he didn’t even try to fight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire groupughs as Das and Richard talk. If only they knew the truth I could only hope that it would no longer be a joking matter but dad tells everyone anything but the truth about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Enough!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Demetri bellows  as   I  can feel his aura gaining strength causing me to whimper when it hits me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I do not tolerate bullying of any sort towards any member  of  any pack! Testing today will consist of running. Damian!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Yes  sir ?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Take these pups to the two mile track that surrounds the yground after breakfast . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Yes sir. Any specifics ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes . Grab a clipboard, pen and paper .  Get Patrick, Parker and Celine to help. Number or color code the group, your choice. I want to know how quickly they canplete a ten mile run.,Best out of four runs. Two after breakfast,  Two  after lunch. Make sure they stretch and get an hour break between each run for water and light snacks. I rmend eating lightly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole group groans in unison  as  Alpha Demetri gets a ‘yes sir‘ from Alpha Damian confirming his order .  Just as the alpha finishes  an  olderdy starts walking towards the dining hall passing by Alpha Demetri.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good morning Kathy, may I borrow your stethoscope?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch her reach into her scrubs and hand one to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Everyone is dismissed” he calls as he jogs lightly over to me. I can’t help but tense up, whimpering lightly as he gets near. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt this vulnerable. My chest is so tight I can barely walk so running or fighting is out of the question. When he gets to me he easily picks up on my reservations despite my desperate need for help. There is no way I can get out of this bad of an anxiety attack feeding my asthma attack cycle without medication.</p>
