                <p>“He doesn’t want me to leave. He thinks Das is going to hurt me for defending him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You really think he’s dumb enough to do such a thing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can see Jamie nod to Patrick’s question before speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Das tends to be the pack bully, sir. I wouldn’t put anything past him. I’ll be fine Cole, I just have toy low until it passes over or until he leaves. He usually is the first one sent packing. At least he was with the previous two packs I’ve gone to.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leans over and gives Cole another hug. It’s only as Jamie stands to leave that the burn on Cole’s leg catches Patrick’s attention. As he steps forward trying to get a better look, I can feel Cole’s back pressing into my chest again. Patrick’s harshness this morning seems to have made him afraid of my beta. I look straight at Pat as  I  speak reassuringly to Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Try to rx Cole, he’s not going to do anything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as my beta leans on the bed trying to get at Cole’s levelfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole.” His voice is soft and neutral. “I’m sorry I didn’t take the time to do this directly this morning but I am sorry that  I   was  rough with you. You  didn’t  deserve that treatment from me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole lifts his head slightly before quietly giving him a submissive sounding thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“May I ask you a question, Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pauses a moment but I can’t tell if Cole has answered him before he continues.;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I do want you to know that what little I have seen is not eptable punishment by the council. You appear to be much worse than anything that’s allowable by councilw for any wrong doing, short of murder, that allows for your alpha to implement physical punishment but these injuries of yours came from you being punished, correct?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel Cole nod his head yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay. What were you punished for?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel Cole stiffen as he leans his head back on my shoulder. His breathing has tightened up again and I’m concerned that he  is  going into another asthma attack. I’m surprised when he actually speaks again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Luna…. Sasha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you saying what Das said at lunch is true?” Patrick asks gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Cole. No. You’ve got to be kidding me. You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. This is the sixth time you’ve been physically punished over that bitch and they just finished the mate’s bond six months ago.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We are all shocked at Jamie’s outburst and level of anger at such simple words. He growls lowly  as  he walks away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re going to have to update me on what’s going on.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ang speaks as she sets everything up for Cole’s surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When Das  was  walking back from the bathroom after Demetri broke up the fight he imed that Cole was a rapist and pedophile. That his beating on Saturday was because he raped their future luna</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick speaks calmly as Jamie paces .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Cole, you’ve got to open up. You said yourself that alpha would be stupid to not recognize that you’re being abused. We both know that the  majority   of   the  pack reports negative things about you just to  see  you punished.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie  pauses in his tirade with Cole, I can tell that they are both hurting emotionally from what’s going  on  with Cole and  fleding  out this Begging da about this luna seems to have really struck a nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Cole please. You have got to find a way out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a while I can feel his head shake as he sniffles from the tears I know must be falling. When I look atmimn 1 can tell he and I’m both surprised but relieved when he speaks his side of the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What do you mean you can’t go yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m even further shocked when Cole speaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can’t leave…… you…. your family….. Dr. Carter….. his family…… All the littles….. I can’t…. abandon you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stays silent as the pack mates argue, their auras growing in power as their frustration with each other peaks. I am impressed with what I feel from both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole please. All he wants to do is help you but he can’t if you don’t talk about it.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No one….. can help me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damn it Cole, think about yourself for once! He’s going to fucking kill you!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all look at Jamie who is now falling apart. I look down to Cole who has muted his aura and closed his eyes. Tears slowly falling down his face. What Jamie has said seems to be a truth Cole already knows, yet he’s still terrified to trust me enough to really open up. His voice is so quiet and submissive  that  he’s barely heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was…. the twin…. that should have never….. survived.”</p>
