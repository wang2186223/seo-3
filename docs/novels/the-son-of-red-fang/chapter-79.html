                <p>“  Stay  with him Jamie. This is just a bad fear response.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s shaking alpha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know. Cole, I’m going to use a pair of scissors to cut through your boxers. Are there any bruises or cuts on the sides of your legs that I should be aware</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear the anxiety building in his voice as I try again. I can feel him trying to shift away from me but Jamie’s hold is strong and  I  can hear him trying to figure out why Cole is so afraid after consenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Were you this nervous when you exposed your secret to dad?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are you afraid of anyone finding out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They’re both quiet as I move to the opposite side. He yelps again as  I  get started using my hand to protect his  skin  from any idental cuts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you ready to try and walk?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as he slowly lifts his head from Jamie’s shoulder. His position tells me he  was  using Jamie’s scent to help him keep calm .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What I would like to do is get you to the bathroom, get you seated so you can take care of your needs and when you’re done, take a picture of your front and back while in the bathroom. There’s a rail you can hang onto in there so it’s the safest ce for pictures standing up until I do  your  physical.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head slowly but I can see the hesitation and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not going to hurt you Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice is soft, almost submissive in nature catching his attention. He looks up at me, and for a moment, into my eyes. Despite the dark navy color the fear written into his eyes is heartbreaking. There’s only twice before now that I can recall seeing simrly fearful  eyes  ,   my  mate when I first brought her home and a little boy that had been abandoned at the human’s children’s hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach out to the young man as he turns away from me again. He tenses up badly when I touch his face .  I’m struggling toprehend why  exposing  such a painful secret is so devastatingly terrifying for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Talk to me Cole. Why is exposing this secret so frightening for you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently rub my thumb across his cheek as a single silent tear falls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It only…. makes it….. worse….. It has never…. helped me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How many packs, that you’ve been a prospect in, have figured out that you’re being abused?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ve only been to three .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did all three figure it out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Jamie but  I’ve  got to help him stand.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he tries to step aside but Cole is resistant to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay Cole.  We’re  taking everything just a little  at  a  time . I promise  you  ,   I   won’t  make it worse on  you .”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hear Cole whimper softly as I take his hands from around Jamie, freeing the young man from his grasp. He looks at me briefly before dacking big b down. It’s easy to see how terrifying his life must be to have such immense fear and anxiety towards me.  I’ve be across plenty of  wolves  in my thre  alpha  through the prospect program that have been abused. They all showed a stronger than normal submission response  and  severe anxiety towards me which alerted me to their struggles, but none havee even close to Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  spend a moment in front of him running one hand through his hair while the other rests gently on his side providing support. I’m silently hoping  that  bie bathroom needs are not too urgent as it’s taking longer than I wanted to get him up and walking.</p>
