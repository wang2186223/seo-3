                <p>“I need to know everything that’s associated with this beating. Das mentioned that your dad kicked you in the abdomen a dozen or more times before taking you to the training room. That it took you a long time to start screaming. This leads me to believe that the bruising to your abdomen and the  cuts   1-  have found all over your body happened at the same time. Are there any other cuts or bruises that I don’t know about?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally nods yes before looking back at me. The fear I see in his eyes is immeasurable as he begins to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The back…. of my neck….. where he…. grabbed me…. My wrists….. my forearms…. and shins….. I broke…. the chain…… I couldn’t take ……  all the hits…… without yelping….. I did….. what I could…. to protect myself.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So I’m looking for defensive wounds as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods slowly as I stand back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll help you get the gown back on once I finish with the pictures of your body. I can get pictures of your neck and other areas of bruising while you sit. I don’t want to keep you standing too long. Do you understand what’s going to happen?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he speaks “yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And are you willing to participate in these pictures ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t…. have much…. of a choice .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods but his verbal response easily tells me he wants to refuse .  He stands slowly from the toilet and follows my directions. He stops after a few  steps  before turning and facing the wall, both hands on the rail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Try to rx, Cole. I understand this is a difficult thing for you to do so soon after meeting me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run my hand through his hair as I gently pull the string on the back of the gown. The bowes undone easily allowing the gown to slide down his arms away from his body. His body trembles bad enough that I can see it, his head is bowed down towards the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pause a moment, wishing in vain that the young wolf could get used to me and my involvement with him. I truly intend to help him but with his previous experiences only leading to more problems, I know that getting what I need to get him out is going to be difficult. I step behind him and position my phone so I get the least amount of re from the overhead lights. I concentrate on each picture for the best image of his current condition. I’m quite shocked at how little these injuries have healed considering the beating happened Saturday. I snap several pictures before speaking with him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well done, Cole. Now I’m going to help get you turned so I can get pictures of your front.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He submits to my position changes easily and hands me his gown. I start with pictures of his chest and work my  way  down. I stifle all sounds when I finally see his groin. I’m amazed at how difficult it is to separate out the different parts of his anatomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His male parts are severely swollen and discolored. There are several raised red lines criss crossing the area giving him the look of being striped. It’s only when I look closer at his left thigh that I see something different. There is arge, fluid filled blister that appears to be a second degree burn goingpletely around the middle of his thigh. I take several quick pictures and stand back up. His eyes are closed and he appears to be counting by the way his lips are moving yet no soundes out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole,” I speak quietly so as not to startle him. “What caused the burn on your thigh? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opens his  eyes  ,  making contact with mine before quickly looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know….. I keep…. my eyes shut….. when he chains me. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why didn’t you tell me about it when I was cutting your boxers? Didn’t it hurt when I touched it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  stretch out his gown so it’s easy for him to ship one of his arms through the hole. He hesitates to put his hand on my shoulder. It’s  only  when I look back to his face that I realize his fear has grown deeper .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong, Cole ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I   can  see his chin trembling  as  he tries to  speak  .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I lied to you…. I’m sorry….. I must have….. forgotten…… he had Andre…… wrap…. something tight….. around my leg….. right after…… chaining me…… … burned bad….. but I don’t….. know why…. Please don’t….. punish me….. I didn’t….. I ck ”</p>
