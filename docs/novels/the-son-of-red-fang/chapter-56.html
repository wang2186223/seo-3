                <p>“  I  guess my lunch meeting with everyone is canceled since I’ve got to babysit those who can’t follow the rules”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Don’t worry too much about it boss ,  we  all  cat together in the pack house so this just gives you more time to think about  what  you  want  to d</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I   can’t  help but smile while I shake my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ You’ve always been the one to look at the bright side of things. Thanks Pat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No problem ,  boss.  See  you at dinner.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s as my beta walks Jamison to the medical wing that Dominic finally shows up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“About time Dom what happened?” “Um. I couldn’t find my notebook from earlier so I  went  to your office.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  shake my head as I sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dom you’d lose your head if it wasn’t attached to your shoulders .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sir, sometimes  I  think I’ve lost it while it’s still there. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckle softly as I marvel at how well my pack gets along with most everyone in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay Dominic this is what I need. Start at the far table. I want names and rank. When  you’re  finished  they  can get their food and sit down .  The ones against the wall are next. Keep the groups separate on your list. Again, I need names and ranks. When the first  group   sits   then  they may  go  get their food. The three left from the fight will get their foodst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You three fighters will report to your rooms after lunch and remain there until dinner. You will onlye out  of   your  room in order  to   report  for dinner then you will return to your rooms. Additional instructions will be given at dinner so don’t bete. The rest of you will  resume  training on the track . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There’s a collective groan but Dominic is already working on names as I sit at the head table observing everyone. I  allow  myself to get lost in my thoughts as the dining hall resumes its orderly way of working. It’s hard for me to believe such harsh rumors being put out about the gentle he – wolfying in  my  medical wing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, rumors almost always have a hint of truth to them. Problem is teasing out what part of those rumors are true and what’s exaggerated. Have I be protective over a rapist and a pedophile?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet it’s obvious that he’s severely abused and neglected, there’s no way anyone can deny that. I need to make notes on everything I see, hear and find out about this young man. He needs help but am I going to endanger my own pack by helping him?</p>
