                <p>‘Nothing is going to change. I am well aware that his asthma is a disqualification but it seems like so far we’re the only ones that have been exposed to that fact and I’d like to keep it that way. What I need is time to figure out his personality. He is the son of Alpha Redmen who is as cruel, vile and disgusting as theye. I need to make sure that the submissive, yet helpful and caring demeanor I sawst night is who this young man really is. Get him through the six month requirement so I can bring him back for a year. Gain his trust so he opens up. The  only  way I can get him out of a bad situation is as a transfer through the prospect program or through a protection order. He has to be in immediate danger if he returns to his pack for me to initiate one or more of those.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lily is nodding her head as I finish up my initial ns for Cole. I back out of the link as Ang enters the room with a body pillow, handing it off to Lilly as she passes her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s going to be very important that the two of you follow my directions. ording to Dr Carter, when Cole is admitted to Red General it’s usually a very painful stay for him. The only time the nursese into his room is to give him medication which is usually in the form of  very  painful shots and for their protection he’s usually tied down with a hard restraint system that doesn’t allow him to move. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So his association with people checking on him when he’s been admitted to the hospital is very negative .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempt to finish her sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“For the most part. Combine that with his difficulty with epting changes in the interventions used to help him and patience bes an absolute necessity.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I kind of figured on that when he said something about getting tied down. Cole, are you awake ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask as I run my hand through his hair. He stirs slightly but not enough to let me know that he’s aware of anything going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, can you lower the side rail Demetri is near. I’ll get this one. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach around the rail myself helping Lilly to lower it down so it’s easier for me to get out of the bed. I listen as Ang does the same on the other. I feel the bed dip under her weight  as  she stands with one knee on the bed. She reaches  across  Cole, gently loosening his hold on my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole,  I  need to roll you onto your side so Demetri can get up. Can you squeeze my hand so I know you understand me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  can’t tell if he responds but shortly after her request she starts moving his arm and body away from me. I startle and curse badly as the most terrified yelpes repeatedly out of Cole’s mouth. I had never heard such an agonizing response to being moved. I know I had sorrow in my eyes when I looked at Lilly  as  Ang finishes moving Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  slip out from under Cole  as  I hear Ang trying to work with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole. Dr. Carter told me that you have a really hard time being in the hospital back home. That it tends to be very painful and terrifying for you. I need you to remember what I told you this morning. The IV that’s already been done is the most painful thing I’m going to do to you. I  will  exin to you everything I’m going to do before I do it. I promise you Cole I’m not going to hurt you and I’m not going to tie you down. You’ve been an incredibly sweet and gentle young man despite the fear and pain you’ve been in. I have no reason to put you in any type of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>restraints . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she’s finished talking to him, he’s settled down into a soft whimper. She still has hold of his hand and I’ve noticed a rhythmic squeeze that he’s engaged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang ,  do you feel what he’s doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  ,  Demetri and he’s absolutely fine. I’m just waiting for it  to  settle down. I noticed it earlier, actually.  He  seems to engage in repetitive behavior when his anxiety is up and I know moving him when he’s this sedated spiked his anxiety.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Now that I think about it, that’s what he was doing against my legs. You wanted him to stop out of fear that he’d hit me in the groin but I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>allowed it to continue. I noticed a pattern.  He’s  very deliberate and calcting with his movements .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ang has taken over theforting aspect of my presence cing her hand in his hair as I get up from the bed.</p>
