                <p>He lifts his hand slowly. As if he’s expecting me to smack it away as he reaches for the cup. When I make no further moes he slowly tilts the cup back  taking  his first sip of food since the previous night. He startles hard back into me but rxes almost as quickly before taking another small  sip  .   I  can’t help  but  smile as his willingness to ept, even this tiny amount of food, increases with every sip. It actually hurts me when he whines as I slow  him  down during one of his longer drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx Cole. You’ve done nothing wrong. You just need to break long enough in between drinks to breathe. I’m not going to take it away. I promise this  isn  ‘  a tease. Your  oxygen  is still low and your lungs are still quite restricted.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s breathing hard, exaggerating his wheezing, as my firm yet gentle pressure keeps him from resuming his drinking. Anges back over to as, handing another cup to Jamie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This stuff actually smells pretty good.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see Ang smile as we all hear his stomach grumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Unfortunately, I wouldn’t rmend you eating it as it’s rich with added vitamins, minerals, protein and fats. It’s  a  special blend we use  when  wolves  can’t  handle regr food. That’s also why we keep the servings small but since he’s showing us he’s hungry and willing to eat, I brought just a little bit more over for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiles as she reaches out to him, touching the side of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to check your eyes really quickly while you catch your</p>
                
                
                
                <p>breath.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel him nod against my shoulder. I’m surprised at how rxed he’s starting to feel in my hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Keep your gaze on me. I have to move slowly to see the change I’m looking for  since  your eyes are  so  dark.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only takes a moment for her to do her assessment on his eyes and his breathing has calmed enough that I gently encourage him to resume drinking the soup. Jamie stays silent as Cole finishes both cups that were prepared for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can’t help but be reminded of my own son as I listen to the soft, rhythmic wheezing that signals the young man is sleeping. Anges over with  the  two shots and four wipes. I’m relieved that she’s nning on using the lidocaine wipes which will decrease any pain from the needle pricks he feels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She helps me get from behind him andy him gently on his side. He grabs a hold of the warming pillow  as  soon as it touches his chest and I help him get into the position he desires. It’s in this 45 degree angle towards his stomach that I see his back under the brighter lights of the room. Ang was  correct  about him having fresh wounds in addition to the scaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, are you still with me?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask as I touch his shoulder. He shifts slightly but not enough to really be awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You have the same marks on your back that you have on your chest. How far down do these go ?  Ang, have you seen this yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walks over as I gently untie and fold  over  one side of the hospital gown he’s in. I take a deep slow breath in as I gaze upon the damage I didn’t see this morning. There’s a thin but long area of skin that’s ck and blue in color. Obvious severe bruising along his ribs. The same, inch wide, angry  red  lines that  we  found on his chest cross his back from his left to his right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Look.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just about whisper as I trace two of the lines across his back to where they fade into the ckness of the bruise .   I  can easily trace at least ten of these marks leading into the same long bruise .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang, look at this  stray  one. The bruising looks to be a belt buckle.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  follow the lines across his back to his hip where it ends in a nasty bruise and stab. More cuts catch my eye and I can’t help but gently fold  the   waistband  of his  boxers  down until I expose about half his rear exposing the same cuts and bruises .  I’m so stunned by the discovery that I nearly miss Ang  trying   to  touch his bruised ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sh I grab her wrist ,  startling her enough that she takes a step back.  My  grip on her is firm but not painful as  I   slowly  release  her ,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Look at his numbers, listen to him breathe. I think he’s finallyfortable enough to rx and break the cycle.”</p>
