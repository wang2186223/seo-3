                <p>He yelps when I ce my hand on the side of his face ,  stopping his struggle to talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  It’s  okay, Cole. I don’t feel that you lied. I’m not mad at you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  quietly reassure him before getting his other arm through the sleeve, I get him to lean against me as I tie the back of the gown before leading him out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We slowly make our way back to his bed without issue. I watch him as his face contorts in pain as he sits so I decide to check his chart for thest time  he  received anything for the pain he’s in. I’ve yet to hear anything back about the X–rays taken of his ribs where that long, ck bruise sits, Ie back  with  several items and sit on the bed next to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’d like to try and get some soup into you as well as some more form through the feeding tube. I’ve got some vicoprofen if you’d like for the pain  you’re  in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s hard to tell if he’s thinking about my offer of pain medication or if he’s simply trying to cope with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak softly as I touch his chin. He startles badly before he looks at me with fearful  eyes  .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, let me give you something for the pain.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>245</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he looks down again. I slip my hand into his and start moving his arm towards me. I freeze when he lifts his hand off mine, quickly bringing it back to his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s wrong, Cole? You agreed that you wanted medication for your pain but you’re showing a lot of hesitation towards me giving it to you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know….. what’s in….. that syringe….. I’m sorry Alpha.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach over and gently raise his chin so he’s looking at me. Even though we seem to be making good headway with the panic induced asthma attack all ! can see is fear. Absolute and all epassing fear within his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How about I hold you for a little bit? It seems like we’ve stepped back away from being able to trust me .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m scared alpha…..” He starts to whisper. “I don’t know how …..  not to be scared”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay to be scared, Cole, and it’s okay not to trust. I just want to help make you morefortable. The medication can wait until Ang gets here.  I’ve  already asked her toe look at the burn on your leg.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head silently as he turns away from me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole ,  will you let me hold you? Let me get some soup into you?”  “ Anxiety….. too high…. to eat….. I’m sorry Alpha. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay, Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak softly hoping to gain some confidence back. He was doing well with me until I took the pictures. I can’t even begin to imagine what might be going through his head right now considering how the other alphas sent him home a month before the council came knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I move the tray off the bed to the table beside it. I fake a few steps to the head of the bed before sitting down behind Cole. He whimpers lightly at my closeness and I can tell he wants to pull away but simply doesn’t have the energy needed to do  so  .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not going to hurt you,”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper lightly near his ear as I wrap my arms gently around him. Now that his breathing is better he has a bit more fight and his  fear  makes it difficult for him toply with what I  need  from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sit back against me. I promise it will help.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His agitation and fight are getting stronger  as  1 gently try to coax him back into me. He continues to lean away from me but hasn’t tried to leave the ben  yet , although it does concern me that he legs are still hanging off the side. He’s moving his arms slowly but the movement is erratic. As  I  watch  his  movements longer his confusion bes clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I follow his movements until I’m able to make contact with his hands. I don’t grab on to him nor does he grab onto me but it does stop  his  movements. H draws  a  sharp, startled breath in as he waits for my next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s okay to touch me Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shakes his head as I struggle to understand what it is that he’s struggling with. No matter how I reassure him that this is what I want he resists following my directions. It feels as if he was punished for doing what he was told as much as he was for defiance,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole please, pulling you towards me is going to cause you pain that I don’t want to cause. Come to me. I’m not going to hurt you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body  freezes  in ce  as  he puts his head in his hands. While I’m starting to understand why Red General feels the need to tie him to the bed I also feel that has ultimately made this situation that much more difficult for him to deal with. I move myself closer to him as he rocks his body back and forth lightly. His head is in his hands but he is no longer actively trying to get away from me.</p>
