                <p>I trail my fingers gently behind her neck finding the zipper to her dress and slowly pull it down to her waist before concentrating on the sps of her bra. She shrugs both items off her shoulders just before she captures my lips into a deep sensual kiss bringing the soldier het want my legs to attention. Her hands wonder my body slowly clueing me into her own hesitance of what she really wants. My arms are wrapped around her back, pulling her into me tightly, my bulging pants grinding against her panties. I can feel her hands shake as the unbuckles my helt followed by the button of my jeans. It’s as she’s grasping the zipper that I growl sharply, firmly pulling her hand away as I’m met with a lite whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I look down into her stunning blue eyes as they fill with tears from my sudden rejection of her actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re shaking Lilly. You’re afraid of me right now. You know I can’t do this when you’re shaking like this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reaches her hand up to my face as I close my eyes and lean into her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I forgave you a long time ago for that first time. It’s about time that you do the same. I love you and despite knowing how the hardest part of this will feel, I sought you out. Just be gentle with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m always gentle with you, Lilly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper as I look into her eyes again, searching for the hesitation I know I feel from her. I find nothing but longing, a desire to be with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just be gentle with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She emphasizes again as she pulls my head down into a deeply sensual kiss filled with passion and need. I know by her emphasis that this is going to be difficult for her so instead of simply giving her what she wants I want to pleasure her. Take my time to give her as much pleasure as I can before it mixes with the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iwrap my arms around her and make no moves to stop her from gently pulling my zipper down, careful to miss my manhood. My jeans fall quickly to the floor as she hooks her thumbs into the waist of my boxers, pushing them away as my hardness is fully uncovered. I hook my thumbs into her panties and in one motion, finish disrobing her as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeals loudly as I pick her up and carry her a short distance to the bed. Iy her down gently and make no moves to adjust my position as her legs are already wrapped around my waist. She rxes her legs into an open butterfly as I move onto her chest. She gasps as I gently suck one of her nipples into my mouth. Gently flicking it with my tongue her body melts in ecstasy. I switch breasts sucking the other pink bud into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s while she’s distracted that I run my hand down between her legs. I take my time, feeling every aspect of her body as I run my hand gently over her inner thigh. I slowly circle around her pelvis until I’m touching her other thigh. She quivers and whimpers as I cross over the middle. The more time my hand spends between her legs the more she tries to close them, the unmistakable nightmares of her past evident in her whimpers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slide my hand back to the center, in between her legs. I still my movement as I push my body back towards her head, capturing her lips in mine. She’s not as confident as she was a few minutes ago. I’ve taken her out of herfort zone. I slowly run my hand gently between her legs. My wolf purrs lightly at the feeling of her slit beneath my hand. She struggles with my touch, her desire to close her legs is obvious as she squeezes my body between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leave her lips and start back on her mark hoping it would distract her enough from the mental uncertainty of what I’m doing for her to ept the feeling of her mate between her legs. Her whimpers quiet as I gently nip her mark. I continue my distraction as I gently press my middle finger barely into her slit, rubbing gently and slowly. I increase my pressure slowly until I reach the sensitive skin inside, rubbing gently against her sensitive nub.</p>
