                <p>“  I’m  sorry Cole but hopefully this is easier on you then previous ones. I need you to breathe through your mouth as I start and swallow when it hits  your  throat. Would you like some water? Most find drinking water makes the tube easter to swallow.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No thank…. you”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, now deep breaths for me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It’s only a couple seconds after she starts that Damian and I have to help him stay still as he whines and fights the process. Ang  keeps  a sympathetic yet encouraging tone to her voice as she advances the tube down into his stomach. Fortunately, the young man stills his fight once the tube gets past his throat .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Ang is done Cole has fallen asleep against my shoulder. Ang smiles as she rubs his head while encouraging Damian to do the same .  She connects a syringe to the tube and slowly pushes a small amount of the contents into the tube.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s saline to verify that the tube is ced in his stomach, not his lungs.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as she pauses, waiting for a reaction that tells her where the tube is at. When he doesn’t react she detaches the first and starts another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, can you hand your father the mask while I finish up with him?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hands it over to me and as I ce it on his  face  Damian grabs the band and pulls it behind Cole’s head. Cole is truly out this time as he doesn’t stir from the mask or whatever Ang is introducing into the feeding tube.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What are you giving him, Ang?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s a high density nutrient mix. This particr one has higher magnesium and potassium levels to help reduce the cramps without giving him a muscle rxer, considering he’s already on one.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as  I  run my hand through his hair. I’ve been doing that a lot with him but he seems to need and enjoy the contact .  Once everything is taped she moves to the IV. He squirms a little when the band is put on his arm but otherwise does well with the difort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She changes everything over so she can draw his blood without any additional pokes with the needle and makes short work  of  the collection process before changing it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The challenge now is getting him toy down without you holding him . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ang chuckles as she cleans everything up. I smile as I listen to the young man wheezing slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dad? Can I speak candidly about Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sure. What’s on your mind?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s older than me. Twenty–three he said. So why does he cling to you like a lost pup? He acted a lot more mature then this yesterday.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s the abuse he’s suffering. Sometimes if it’s severe enough for a long enough time it can change the wolf’s way of thinking. Some even  be   two  separate individuals depending on the situation they’re in. He’s in a highly vulnerable situation right now and just like a pup, he’s too  weak  to fight anyone off or run to protect himself so instinctively he turns into a pup. Most adult wolves would never hurt a pup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole, I need toy you down but I’ll be back in a couple hours  to  check on you. I’m sorry we had to do the feeding tube but at least  we  avoided the cath. Personally I think those are worse. I’m going to leave the mask on you and leave the container so you can relieve yourself without getting  up  .  I just  wish  you would talk to me.  I  can get you out of this hell you’re living in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian, I need you to stand right up against the bed. I’m going to shift him  over  to you so I can get up without him just falling over. I don’t think a sudden fall will help his asthma any.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian and I work together to get Cole leaning against his chest as I get up gentlyy him on his side beforeying him at an angle against the  heated  pillow. Once I’ve made the young manfortable I make sure everything is in his reach, including a bottle of water and the call button ,  before  motioning  for Damian to follow me. We’re running a bit past the noon time frame that I wanted to meet the others but it’s still before one so that’s  where   we   head .  To  the dining hall with the rest of the Red Fang pack.</p>
