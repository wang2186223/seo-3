                <p>After nearly three hours of phone conferencing with the council and twenty of the one hundred east coast packs involved in the prospect program, I’m finally free to leave my office. It was a grueling three hours as I haven’t been able to pull my mind away from the young man in the hospital wing, Alpha Cole Redmen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was able to do some research on him while on the phone and he is indeed the Alpha’s youngest son. The only information I have received is an email from Dr. Carter showing me the medication he’s on. Unfortunately that’s all I’m allowed to find out as I don’t have a justifiable cause to invade his private medical files. At least not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run into Lily just as I’m exiting my office. I quickly wrap my arms around her before giving her a long sensual kiss. I gently nip her lower lip. asking permission to take it a step further. Something I only do when I know no one else is around. She pulls away gently, knowing exactly where this is headed. She’s smiling but apprehensionces her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite werewolves being very sexual creatures and we’ve been together for twenty–two years, we haven’t engaged in sex regrly unless she’s desired a pup. Sex has never been easy for her yet she knows that’s exactly what I’m asking for and I know I’m going to get it when she opens my office door back up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close the door gently, locking it as she heads for the back room containing a full size bed and a full bath. I gently close that door as well when I get in there. I stand a foot from the door, watching her movements as I vowed twenty years ago that I would never hurt her again like 1 did that first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she ims she doesn’t know if her father raped her, her father did admit to mine the he actively engaged her in ‘sexual training‘. An old tradition where the girl’s father teaches her how to please her mate from an early age and the end result is rape. It’s been considered sexual abuse for decades but that doesn’t stop it from happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We met when I was eighteen, she was sixteen. Her father had been training her on how to please her mate since she was six. He had us get a room together while my father worked out the arrangements necessary for us to bring her back to our pack. The only time my father would bring one’s fated mate back to the pack before they were eighteen was if they were being abused or if the pack was more than   a twelve hour drive from ours. Lilly was both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body is tense as she slowly walks around the room, kicking her shoes off at the edge of the bed. I do the same at the door but I don’t like her posture, she needs to rx or I’m not going to take her no matter what she says.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walk up behind her, gently running my hands down her arms, taking her hands in mine. I lightly run the tip of my nose down the side of her neck taking in every aspect of her scent before lightly nipping my mark on her. Her wolf purrs lightly as she leans into me. It’s a little more towards what I’m looking for with her but she’s still tense. As much as I need this release with her to clear my head and focus my thoughts on how to handle this abused young man in my territory I won’t hurt her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re tense Lilly. I know you won’t refuse me but you also know I won’t take you tense. What’s on your mind?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That boy in the hospital. It’s been a long time, Demetri. My cycles have merged this month so I know I’m on the sensitive side which will make this difficult for me but I need this from you just as much as you do.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turns in my arms, cing her hands around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know you go off bodynguage more than my words but please Demetri, you know what I need when stuff like this happens.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head as I kiss her forehead. I don’t linger there though. I move to the side of her head to her ear before giving it a gentle nip. I continue my trail down her jaw, to her neck before concentrating on my mark. Her body responds instantly to my kisses, licks and lite nips upon my mark. A single bite mark, now a scar, in the crook of her neck between her neck and corbone.</p>
