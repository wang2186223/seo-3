                <p>“For an hour, maybe a little longer depending on what I have going on, I will bring you to Cole so the two of you can spend time together while he’s here Wait for me in the dining hall after each meal. You will be seated at thest seat in the hall. As soon as youe in the doors it’s on the right  side   closest  to the door. I wille get you and take you to Cole. You will stay with him until Ie get you and escort you back to your room.  If  you  leave   Cole’s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How?” room, other than using the bathroom, then you will forfeit this privilege. Any questions</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiles as he shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ No sit, thank you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reach out to him and run my hand through his hair getting him to look back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Shall we go visit him again?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stand from the couch and offer my hand to him. He takes it and stands as well. Following close behind me, we head towards the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We return to Cole’s room to see him fighting his invisible assant again. My main guess is his father. I jog lightly over to him hoping that  I  can interrupt his dream before it gets too intense. I pull the railing behind his back down making room for me to kneel behind him. I slip one hand into his and I’m shocked when he grabs it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha… please ….  talk to me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear the desperation in his voice as I lean over his trembling body, hoping that my scent is different enough to calm him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Try to rx Cole. It’s Alpha Demetri. I’m not going to hurt you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nods his head as he tries to gain control over his anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry…. alpha…. sometimes….. it’s hard…. to remember….. where I am.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>PI change my position so I’m sitting on the bed with him leaning his back against me. I start rubbing the back of his head, gently encouraging him to rx</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with me. His grip on my hand is strong and hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“As much sleeping as you’ve been doing I would  expect  as much. Are you hungry or need to use the bathroom?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Both.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want to try and walk? You won’t be alone until you’re on the toilet and there’s  a  call button so I can help you when you’re done.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need help…. getting my…. boxers off.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I will help you with anything you need Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s going….. to hurt ….  me alpha. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Taking thest of your clothes off?” He nods his head slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Because of the injuries on your back and bottom?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m shocked when he shakes his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No?” I ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can handle …..  my back and butt….. The front…. is a bit harder.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a soft sigh as I have an understanding of what that means. I start rubbing my thumb softly against his hand taking  my  time  before   I  speak  as   I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>know this will tell him what Jamie has told.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s very important that you be honest with me, Cole. As you have already told Jamie, it see</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that you understand that I can not ignore your conditione That it is easy to see that you are being abused and it’s been urring for a long time. I need your permission to document  what  Ang and I have found. The only thing I can promise right now is if I get the council involved I will not send you home. You have nothing to lose in letting me take pictures of fi condition you’re in right now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise he nods a yes and his steady grip on my hand has be thythmic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The easiest way I can get your boxers off would be to cut them.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s fine .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, so let’s start with sitting you up. Let’s see how you handle that. Jamie, the side.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>can you put the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rail down on your side and help Cole move his legs  off</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slide my free hand under his shoulder once Jamie is done. To my surprise, he wraps his arms around Cole and Cole responds with the same. Once he’s sitting up I hear him quietly whisper “Please stay.” to Jamie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Doesn’t this hurt you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It does….. I’m scared….. I need you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watch as Jamie starts rubbing Cole’s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t think this alpha is going to hurt you, Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I want to….. believe that….. but three….. already…. have.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take a moment to step away and get a pair of scissors. When I return Cole is quiet but very tense and shaking badly. I attempt to move  the  gown he’s wearing but stop as soon as he starts yelping, scaring Jamison in the process.</p>
