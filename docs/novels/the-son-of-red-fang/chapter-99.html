                <p>I  hear Jamie gasp as Andrew exits the room. I look towards the ground to see Damian holding Jamie over the mat, now drenched in blood and saline as f*** attempts to clear blood from the young man’s nose and mouth, whimpering softly from fear and pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft knock at the door alerts me to the presence of the warriors I requested, twin deltas, Darren and Derrick have arrived to watch over Andrew. I step outside the room asmie yelps and fights briefly when Damianys him in hisp while Jessa puts pressure on his still bleeding nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak to them briefly exining the schedule, what his punishment is and what my expectations of them are before returning to Jamie. I freeze in Jane’s doorway as I’m shocked by the young man’s appearance. Both eyes are nearly swollen shut with blood tinged tears slowly falling from his eyes. His note and mouth are red and swollen, stained with the blood Jessa used silver nitrate to finally stop from flowing. Jessa is the first one to sense my presence back in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s going to need help getting down the stairs. Without an elevator getting the gurney up here is impossible. Based on the bleeding I’m concerned about his nose being broken and he has severalcerations in his mouth that may need stitches. Outside of his nose, nothing else feels broken but I can’t rule it. outpletely. He has a lot of pain in his head, his chest, around his ribs and his abdomen.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh heavily as I quickly think of what needs to be done. I hesitate before asking but considering what I interrupted I feel it’s important to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I interrupted a kick that appeared aimed at his groin.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m relieved when Jessa shakes her head and Jamie speaks for the first time in a while,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No, Alpha. I think he was saving that forst.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head relieved they spared him that pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I would rmend a CAT scan of his head and abdomen. You need to rule out internal bleeding in both areas .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you feeling okay, Jessa? We normally do tests based on what you feel but you don’t seem as certain as you usually are.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This cold of mine has made me a bit weak but I’m okay, alpha. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give her a clipped growl as I have never liked other alphas calling me alpha but her past has made it difficult for her to change the habit despite being with me for three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looks up at me, a bit startled and fearful from my reaction. I cock my head looking at her with annoyance in my eyes but an amused grin on my face. She rxes with my appearance and turns her attention back to Jamie‘.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s approximately the same height as Lilly, he just appears to be a little heavier so I can use the housekeeper’s elevator to carry him to the first floor. Damian, he’s going to be out until after he has his physical next week at a minimum.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is the room beside Cole’s taken yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No sir. Only four members of the White Moon pack where non–smokers and there were four females between the two packs so sixteen members of White Fang and White Moon packs ended up on the third floor and four took the first floor of building ‘B‘ and the four she–wolves are in building ‘C‘ first floor.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well that’s a good thing for what I need. Do you have your own master key?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, sir”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good. Leave endurance testing to Patrick and Dominic tomorrow. I need you to get some housekeepers, bring them up here to Jamie’s room with some boxes just in case. I need you to go over it with a fine toothedb, make sure you get all of his belongings and move him to apartment 103A. Jamie, have you used theundry room yet?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shakes his head slowly but his movement is restricted by himying on his side in Damian’sp. He yelps suddenly as Damian starts  to  im up. I can tell he’s struggling badly with the pain of his injuries mixing with his swollen eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is he okay to get moving, Jessa?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  sir. I didn’t realize the medical pack in the ambnce ran out of the IV kits so I’ll have to do that back at the wing.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Thank you, Jessa.”</p>
