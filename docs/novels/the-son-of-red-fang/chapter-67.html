                <p>Jamison and I stop by the kitchen inside the pack house. Any leftovers from lunch are packed up and stored in the refrigerators we have set up in there. I open the door and pull out a dish, setting it on the counter. Peeling back the foil, Ie acrosssagna, one of my favorites. I pull out several more dishes to reveal broli with cheese and a te of the standard grilled meats; hotdogs, hamburgers, and a variety of different sausages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We try to appeal to everyone who may decide to eat at the dining and banquet halls by having a main dish with vegetables, potatoes, pasta and meat  The  pack is big enough that food rarely goes to waste. Dinner is the only meal that my family eats together, separate from the pack. Most nights my  beta   and  his son join us. My delta, Anthony and his family, will join when I have important information that he needs to be briefed on. Everyone in the pack knows they cane in the kitchen and heat up leftovers if they get hungry or miss lunch. I pull three tes from the cab and start dishing out food for Lilly  and  L</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Grab yourself what you want while I put these in the microwave.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I invite Jamison. He gives me a respectful nod with a quiet thanks as he grabs a couple sausages and cheeseburgers with a side of broli.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Will that be enough for you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir. This will hold me until dinner.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that I start putting everything away as I wait for the food to heat. We head to my office once Jamison’s food is ready. I hand him my te so I can unlock the door. My luna is inside and quite vulnerable right now. I step inside my office  as   I  open the door, directing Jamie to my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Take a seat at my desk but stay out of my chair. I’m going to check on Luna, you stay out here .  “ –</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice is quiet but respectful as he sits in the chair in front of my desk. I stand at the door to the bedroom until he’s eating, entering quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ce her te on the nightstand before crawling into the bed with her. She’sying on her side facing me but her breathing is steady and even  reassuring  me that she’s still sleeping. I wrap my arms around her, drawing her close as she  stirs  awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“How are you doing ,  Lilly?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It still hurts .  ”  She whimpers as she snuggles into my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry baby. I should’ve anticipated your reaction better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s not your fault. You were just caught up in the moment like any mate should be. It’s not as bad  as  the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>first  time we tied and I flipped out.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>badly f</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t remember much of our first time together. I allowed my wolf to take over so I wasn’tpletely there.  I’ve  always believed that I raped you that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>first time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is that why it took you two years to touch me again?” I nod my head as I gently touch her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Demetri, you have never harmed me in such a way.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispers  as   she  gently kisses my lips, my wolf purrs softly with the contact. Her kisses  are  slow and sluggish but I still feel the underlying need and desire within them. I deepen the kiss, gently nipping her lip, slipping my tongue inside when she gasps. I guide her gently to her back, caressing her naked body.  I  spend just a few minutes like this with her until she’s finally awake enough to eat. I back out of our heated kiss slowly until I finally break it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  As  much as I’m enjoying this and ultimately want more, I think it’s time you eat something and I get back to the young man in my office.” She stiffens  at  the thought of mystment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx Lilly, he knows not toe in.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whisper against her lips before sitting up beside her. She gives me a smile and a nod as she runs her fingers down the side of my face. I smile before  giving  her a final kiss and climbing off the bed. I walk  over  to her clothes still on the floor and gather them before returning to her. I  help  her back into her  dress  before taking her te to the small desk inside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are  you  ok or do you want to eat with Jamison and I?”</p>
