                <p>“I don’t understand Demetri, be’s Red Fang. Some of the worse, problematic wolves we continue to deal with. Assault, rape and incest aremon, even eptable for the pack to engage in. Here we’ve had assaults on both males and females both in and out of their pack, and attempted rape of female prospects. Are you certain this is the path you want to take with this one member of that group?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand your reservation and I’ll allow you to have it but I have always maintained an individualist view of every prospect thates through and Cole is different.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t like this, if he’s in such bad health that he’s in the hospital already we’d be better to wash our hands of him and send him back when he’s capable of traveling.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As continue listening to their conversation I can’t help but be anxious again. As hard as I’ve been trying to get rid of it, the beta’s desire to be rid of me is nerve racking spiking my anxiety again. I fight the mask harder than the first time sessfully freeing myself from the alpha’s grasp, gasping for breath once I’m free. Alpha Demetri catches my hand as I struggle against him, stopping my struggle as he leans over gently speaking to me near my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Cole. This conversation is not one that should be happening right now but I assure you that I will not be kicking you out of my program. You will not be sent home once we get you better.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri, I have to strongly disagree with this decision. You know nothing about–him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Exactly Patrick, you’ve written him off simply because of where he came from and not for the person he is. He will have a chance to show me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>who he is!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Enough, both of you!” Dr. Pierce finally steps in, ending the argument between the higher powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need you to open your  eyes  .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kneels beside the bed  as  she shines a small light into both  as  I’ve now got a tight grip on the alpha’s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, your oxygen levels have been too low for too long. You need to wear the mask.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha reaches for it again and ces it on my face. Despite my high anxiety I really have no fight left in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is the mask ufortable for you? Dr. Carter did mention that when you’re in the hospital he uses a lined mask that’s very soft against your face. That the hardness of the standard one gets you ustrophobic.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head at what she has said as it’s all true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So it’s very important to be honest with me. I need to know how long you’ve been without your medication. It’s been  six  months since you’ve seen Dr. Carter. He’s quite worried about you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head agreeing to talk the best I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“First the asthma medication. How long since you’ve been out?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head no as i wasn’t out I just didn’t have it with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re not out? So why didn’t you bring it?“/</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my relief Alpha helps me on this one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I asked the same question while waiting for Kathy to get the chair. He told me that he tried to bring them. I was able to guess that he packed them but they were removed before he left.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  give  a thumbs up trying to indicate a correct answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay ,  so let’s do the thumbs up or down for yes and no. That seems fairly easy for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give another thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you use a nebulizer?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you out of albuterol?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I give her a thumbs down for no I’m not out before putting my fingers close together to show that there’s only a little left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you been rationing the medication?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sigh through the mask before giving a thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’re supposed to use the nebulizer two to three times a day. How often have you been using it?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I close my eyes trying to rx with the questioning not wanting them to know how bad things are for me at Red Fang. After struggling to take in a few bigger breaths I finally hold up one finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Once a day ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shake my head and give her a thumbs down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Once  a  week?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs up. She sighs  as  she continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Albuterol rescue inhaler? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs up then close fingers ,  I still had that but it was starting to run low from using it more than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ You have it but it’s low.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Trelegy?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Singir? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thumbs down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So out of half the stuff you’re supposed to be taking. What about your anxiety medication? Do you have any of that left?”</p>

                <p>I put up three then four fingers.</p>
