                <p>“Everyone is too afraid to touch him let alone hold him like you do.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I know I haven’t done anything that warrants an apology but I am very sorry to hear you have suffered through such misery in the hands of those who are supposed to help.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He appreciates the thought. He feels that it’s not their fault. The only one at General that’s stayed long enough to get to know him and his history is Dr. Carter. It’s the budget and the rumors that are started about him that truly hurt him. Everyone thinks he is some crazy psychopath that rapes little girls. That he’s violent and unpredictable.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you ready to try and eat something?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a confused look before pointing to the tube taped to the side of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Cole, not the tube. We’re going to supplement the small amounts of chicken soup you drink with a nutrient rich milk based form in the tube bat   if we use that as your only source then when you get off the tube your stomach has a hard time processing real food. Anytime we have a sick wolf in the wing Luna Lilly makes her famous chicken soup. The pickiest pup doesn’t even turn it away. When Ang or Kathy get it, they split it up between the patients that can’t eat regr food and they add supplements ording to their age, weight, height, and rank. Then we heat up small portions up to six times a day depending on how well they’re eating. They either do it themselves or someone helps them. You’re a little tall for Ang which is why I’m doing it.”</p>

                <p>I squat down beside his bed and look him in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Keep the contact Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I speak softly, encouraging him to still his darting eyes. He closes them briefly before opening them to look directly at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Good job. Was Damian correct? Have you been drugged without your knowledge?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can I tell him Cole? What I’ve seen while you were living with us?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie sounds almost desperate as Ang and I help Cole to sit up, raising the head of his bed after he’s up to give me the proper support to help him. I slip behind Cole while Ang supports him. Once I’m in a good position, she helps to adjust his position so his back is leaning against my chest before handing</p>

                <p>“He’s not certain how to do this with either hand. No one has tried to do this except you about an hour ago.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie exins for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay, how about I’ll start off holding it, get you to take a few sips so you can get a feel of the temperature and if it’s going to upset your stomach, then we will figure it out from there.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I   can  feel him nod against my chest as I take the small portion of soup from Ang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to give you two IM shots. I can use your arm or the side of your thigh. I’ll let you pick. You came back extremely low on magnesium, potassium and vitamin K so I need to supplement them. Two shots, twice a day for the  next  four days.
