                <p>I’m  intrigued by his honesty about Cole and I desire more information but the young man seems hesitant to divulge too much about his  friend .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Nothing you tell me will change how I treat Cole. What are these tics you’re talking about? I have noticed that he has a liking for rhythmic moverents  when  he’s stressed but he hasn’t been active enough for me to see anything else .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t know what triggers it and we only saw it once during the eighteen months he lived with us but…… He came back from one of his monthly visits with his dad in really bad shape. The worst we had seen over the six months he had been there at the time. Dad pushed him   to tell him what happened but instead of talking he got angry. Dad kept pushing until he put his fist through the wall. He ran away from us. Stayed away for several hours, he didn’t be  back untilte that night. When he came back both his hands were in bad shape. Red, swollen and bleeding. He had a bad cut to his forehead, simr  to   the  one you’re fixing on me and the back of his head was busted open too. When dad asked what happened all he was willing to say was that the cave wall  won  .  Dad never pushed for answers again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Self injury?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We guessed as much but dad decided that pushing for answers did more harm so he didn’t .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Did your dad take him to the hospital?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No. Cole refused to go. Mom’s a nurse and dad has training as a medic so they used those  skills   to  patch him up at home. Dad cut his hair really short so he could glue the cuts together. It hurt him a lot but somehow he never screamed. Mom cleaned his hands but couldn’t do much for  the  broken bones. We all know that he doesn’t heal like the rest of us  so  she was quite lost. Dad refused to let him work for two weeks and gave him light stuff for two weeks after that. We never saw anything like it afterwards. Dad simply took  care   of  whatever condition Cole returned in after his mandatory visits with his dad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why did your dad let him go?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole was only eighteen so not considered 100 percent adult yet. It took my dad  six  months  to  convince Alpha Redmen  to   allow  Cole to have a real apprenticeship, where he moves in with his teacher, so he was willing to agree to just about anything as long  as  he could get Cole out of the pack house .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Sounds like your dad may have known more about Cole’s issues with his dad then most of  the  wolves in the pack.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“More along the line of having a willingness to listen and believe Cole over his father. There were several times while Cole had just started working with dad when he showed upte. He became extremely submissive when my dad chastised him. Dad said he’s never seen an alpha so submissive .  Said Cole refused to look at him, even after he calmed down. He was rmed when  Cole  stepped away from him when he tried to approach him. That he dropped to his  knees  in hard submission when he tried touching him. He was so afraid of my dad that his entire body shook and he struggled to breathe properly.  It  was after the third time Cole reacted that way that dad decided Cole needed toe live with us. It took  six  months but he made it happen. Unfortunately he couldn’t fully protect him but it did give us some insight as to who Cole really is.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“When he’s not sick or afraid, who is Cole?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s very kind and considerate.  He  loves working in the nursery.  He  calls the pups the littles. That’s how  we  got to  see  the best of him, alpha. When he yed with my little sisters and brother. He would sit on the floor with them and justugh. There was no fear ,  no hesitation. He was able to push aside everything negative about his life and just live in the moment with them. It took awhile for mom and dad to  see  past the pedophile rumor.</p>
