                <p>He’s increasing his struggle as he whimpers and whines. Damian is confused and horrified as to how quickly Cole has changed. I know  I   have   to  gain control but I’m trying hard not to submit Cole out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to listen to my voice, Cole. I know you don’t trust me but I need you to at least realize where you’re at and that everything is different here. You’re not tied down and you’re not going to be but I need control Cole. Otherwise you’re going to hurt yourself”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m…. sorry…. alpha….. …..can’t….. do….. this…. please….. …..need….. a….. cath…. they…. always….. hurt….</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is that why you’re so upset? You think I’m restraining you so we can cath you?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Can’t…. make….. it to….. bathroom…. hurts….. bad….. to hold”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I understand what you need Cole but I need you calm so I know you’re not going to hurt yourself. Rx with me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slows his pulling of his hands and legs until they are still but he doesn’t rx.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s better Cole. I need you to concentrate on my touch. What do you feel ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He starts moving his head around but unlike previous times that I’ve rubbed his head, his anxiety spikes instead of rxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No….. please…… No…. trouble….. I’m….. sorry…..”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he says confuses me as does his sudden strength in fighting me. He pulls his hands from mine with incredible strength considering his condition before rolling onto his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s gone into a desperate state of fight or flight triggering a partial shift as his ws dig into the bed trying to pull himself out from under me. Damian remains frozen in ce as the young man tears multiple holes in the sheet and mattress in his crazed attempt to get away from me. It doesn’t take long to realize I have to do what I was trying to avoid with such a scared he–wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ce my hand fully on his neck preparing to submit him out when he gets even worse. His screams echo loudly around the room causing Damian and I both to cringe at the sound. Our only savior at the moment is that the room is soundproof, all the rooms in the medical wing are. I have never had such a terrifying response to a hard submission grab let alone a partial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I immediately change my tactics and grab ahold of his wing hands. I use my weight and height to my advantage to slow his movements and in a calm butmanding voice I make mymand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha Cole Jonathan Redmen you will submit.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He whines loudly as he’s obviously torn with themand. He knows that he’s to follow a directmand from any pack’s lead alpha but it seems as if he feels it’s putting him in an even greater vulnerability than he already is.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m…. sorry….. alpha….. please….. don’t…. hurt….. me….”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freeze briefly as I listen to the young man’s pleas, horrified at such a dramatic response towards submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I need you to rx. It’s important that you submit. Fighting me is putting you in a very dangerous situation.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s squeezing my hands hard and I can feel his entire body shake beneath me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha…. please…. no sub…. mission….. please….. don’t…. hurt…. me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallow hard, keeping emotions in check and running the pack with a level head are critical traits for every alpha and this young  he – wolf   is  challenging both of those as he copses. Finally giving up his fight as his body shakes hard with his sobs,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to move with me Cole, I’m not going to hurt you. Damian, I need your help getting him back  on   his  side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see a mix of emotions in Damian’s eyes as he silently nods. I work my way off of Cole while maintaining a hold  on  his hands,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need to get you on your side so 1 can help you with your bathroom issue. I promise, as long as you can push it out  I   don’t  need  to  cath you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I…. can’t….. push….. it hurts.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian and I finish rolling him to his side just as Ang walks in. She immediately goes to the cab and starts pulling  out   everything  n? use for a catheter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We told him that we wouldn’t until we had to.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That was before my second phone call to Dr. Carter where I challenged him on why they restrain Cole sp harshly when he’s really  sweet  and the reason behind the cath and feeding tube. His experience with Cole has shown him that his body shuts down making  it  difficult  for   him   to  do everyday functions.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Bring the urinal container with you. I’m giving him a chance before we cath him. Damian ,  help me get his pants off.”</p>
