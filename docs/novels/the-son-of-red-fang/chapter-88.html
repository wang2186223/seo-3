                <p>“Are you talking about the warrior in the wing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m surprised at how concerned Madilyn sounds about the prospect that I haven’t mentioned anything about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rumors spread fast around here. You know that.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilly looks lovingly into my eyes as she speaks. She gives me another kiss before standing from the bed, encouraging the girls to follow her I smile on they cling to me, begging me to join them. I give each a kiss on their forehead before cing them on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My sensitive Madilyn pouts as she follows Lilly to the door of my office. Today has been rough on everyone as the girls are used to a lot more attem from both of us during the day but they’ve spent a lot of time with their nanny instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I run up on my little girl and grab her from behind. I toss her in the air, spinning her gently so shends in my arms facing me. It only takes a moment in the safety of my arms for a smile to spread across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“That’s better.” I whisper in my little one’s ear as I nibble on her neck causing her tough and squeal happily.   “Go get some dinner. You’re going to be sleeping by the time I get to eat tonight.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay daddy.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kneel this time as I ce her on the ground. Madisyn, taking advantage of the situation ,  bounds into my arms with her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Just remember, no matter how busy or hard my day is ,  I love you and will be here when you need me .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We love you too.” They sing in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time they head to the door nicely with their mother as I head to my desk and start preparing for my phone meeting with Xavier .  It doesn’t take long for me to get everything I have so far on Cole organized and my phone to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha ck.” I answer the phone, putting it on speaker since I’m alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Evening Demetri, to what do I owe the pleasure of talking with you old friend?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I wish it was a pleasurable conversation that I was going to have with you but  I’ve  encountered aplicated situation that needs extremely delicate handling.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is that so? Talk to me. What’s going on?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Well, as the council prescribes, I run three, six month runs before taking a six month break and contacting the prospects that I’m interested in for the full year trial. As I’m certain you’re aware, this week is bringing in the prospects, before physical week next week, then testing getting started the  week  after . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir, but none of this should be unusual for you. You’ve participated in the warrior prospect program for ten years now.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t normally need guidance on how to help and care for an abused individual but this is one of the  severest  cases that I’ve  seen  to date.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“And they are unwilling to talk about it.” Xavier manages to finish my sentence easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He hasn’t even been here 24 hours yet and he’s in my medical wing. The injuries that we have found along with other factors is going to make it difficult for me to start any formal testing let alone training with him for at least a month, maybe longer.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’ve got my attention Demetri, what’s going on with this brand new wolf on yournd?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What I need is the ability to pull him from his pack without him talking. There’s also a family, outside of his own, that is deeply involved with him that ,   for  their safety, I feel would need to be relocated/ Possibly a doctor and his family as well.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is getting really deep and you haven’t even told me what’s going on.”</p>
