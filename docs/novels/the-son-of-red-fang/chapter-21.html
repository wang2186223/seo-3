                <p>I find myself rxing with the alpha’s sermon towards his beta. I can tell by the sound of his voice that he is remorseful for his harshness without the alpha getting overly aggressive with him. I feel him on my hand again and once again I pull away, whining persistently as I don’t. want him on me after that encounter with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx Cole, he’s not going to do it again.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time he keeps a firm hold on my hand as I move around, following my movements instead of yanking on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Much better, Patrick. He’s just like Damian when ites to needles, only he’s a harder stick which means when I start I need you to keep him still without yanking on him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounds submissive now but that doesn’t make me any morefortable with him. Dr. Pierce uses my movements to get the band around my arm. The difort of the tight band spikes my anxiety, tightening my chest. I start moving my legs slowly against the alpha’s using caution when ites to anything sensitive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole, I want you to still your legs. I don’t want you to hurt Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s fine Ang. Just as you said before he’s  very  gentle. I can tell by the way he’s moving that he’s very aware of where he’s at, not evening close to the family jewels. Plus something about it seems to be calming for him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pull on my arm again  as  she starts feeling around for a vein. She ends up concentrating on a single spot that’s been used before. It hurts bad and is badly scarred from all the bad attempts on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Alpha “I wheeze through the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can hear you Cole, what do you need?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He speaks softly as his head is on top of mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Bad… spot…. hurts …..  bad….. little….. flow… ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m not certain how it made sense but he put it together quick enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ang, that vein  is  no good. See if there’s another one .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my relief she starts moving around my arm again allowing me to  rx  a little. The alpha’s hand is in my hair, giving me a third thing to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>distract me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Cole ,  can you tell where I’m at?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  ”  I wheeze into alpha’s ear. “I…. don’t…. think ….  it’s…. been…. used….. much.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Okay ,  so we will give that one a try.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifts his head so  he  can speak loud enough for Dr. Pierce to hear. She switches over to cleaning the area with alcohol causing the high pitched whine to return. I can’t help but whine and squirm as she lines everything up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you still Cole. I know these are hard on you so I’m moving quickly. This feels like a nice thick vein so I’m going to take some blood when I get in to verify flow before taping it down. Big pinch in 3… 2…“.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I  yelp and struggle as she pushes the needle into my arm. Alpha’s hug is tighter than before forcing me to stay still.  A  couple  of  seconds seems a lot longer but to my relief I hear her tell Patrick that he can let me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m not going to show you since the IV isn’t taped but he’s got me now and I’ve  got  to say, this one’s got a good grip on him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I’m worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Am… …. hurting…. him….?” I gasp through the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s worried that he’s hurting you Pat.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Cole. You hang on as long as you need.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settle back into alpha. There’s something about the way he’s holding me that isforting in a way I don’t understand. I’m starting to rx when the needle moves again. I yelp as I try to push myself away but Patrick has grabbed my hand so I can’t pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry Cole. I just need to move a little deeper into the vein. Seems like I had only grazed the surface and I was getting just a little bit of   a flow from it. It’s good now, no more moving. I’ll tape everything in ce in a moment.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“So you actually got a good line going?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir. Cole is very sensitive to everything going on despite his high amount of fear. It made it a lot easier to get this the first time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha’s hand starts moving around my head again.  I  can’t help but rx into it as I’ve  never  received this kind  of  attention from my parents when I was having a bad attack like this.</p>
