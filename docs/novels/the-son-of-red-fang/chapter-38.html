                <p>I’m horrified when I feel the mating knot move knowing that it’s more than fifty percentpleted. Her screams are deafening as the sharp seating pain of the knot tearing into her sensitive flesh hits her seconds after her desperate move. I grab her swinging fists at the wrists as L use my shear size and strength to force her back down, t on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She is sobbing hard from the pain and absolutely frantic as she finally starts to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can’t do this, Demetri. I can’t handle the tie. Please, I can’t do this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continues her frantic cries trying to fight me but at six foot two inches and 250 pounds I easily overpower her, there’s nothing she can do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I take control of the situation quickly as I feel the excruciating pain and panic that Lilly is in. I’ve taken her hands and ced them together above her head holding them firmly with my left hand. As she still struggles in my grip I have no choice but tomand her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Luna Lillian you will submit.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my relief it calms her fight the rest of the way. I’ve nevermanded submission from her before and I was warned by my dad that doing so could result in a bad fight response instead of actual submission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her body haspletely given up all the fight she had I know that I can’t wait any longer to move the tie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly baby, I’m sorry but I’m in a really bad spot for this tie to keep going. I have to force it further in, where it was before.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Demetri! Please we need to separate. I can’t do this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need your trust Lilly. Separating is not an option. The tie is nearlyplete and if I don’t move deeper into you this is going to be a potentially dangerous situation for you.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I can’t Demetri. Please.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Lilly, look at me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finallymand her attentionpletely. She stops moving and opens her eyes. She’s scared and in unbelievable pain that only I can reduce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“We’re going to mark. A brand new one on the opposite side of the original.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasps at the concept of a second mark but doing so will reduce the pain of breaking the tie loose allowing me to get it properly ced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately as a doctor I’ve been exposed to many mates that have encountered a simrly painful situation and know how to get us out of it. I shuffle my legs up to her bottom, spreading them slightly so that she’s forced into an ufortably wide position widening her pelvis. Iy over top of her body, bringing her hands down beside her head so she doesn’t feel quite so restrained. She seems grateful when I intece our fingers as she immediately grabs hold hard as I position myself for the rest of it. I get down as low against her as I can and whisper in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Trust me Lilly. Line up your canines for marking on my left side.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifts her head and does as I’ve instructed. I can feel her canines resting near the crook of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“On three baby. You bite down and you bite hard. You keep your bite hard until the pain inside you dies down.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“No Lilly. There’s no choice on this. One… two…. three”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She does as she’s told, biting down hard on my cor bone as I ram my pelvis into her breaking the tie loose, digging my own canines into her at the same time. Her screams are stifled by her bite as she puts a death grip on both my hands. My hands move with hers as she fails her arms</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in response to the fight or flight instinct she’s trying to ovee,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I release my canines first, gently licking and sealing the wound from any potential infection as her screams finally quiet to be reced by win. She releases her canines slowly as she’s struggling to fully function after the onught of pain the just endured. I keep my head low, fonderly caring for the bite I created with my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Let go of my hands sweetie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She’s hesitant but lets me free. I immediately slide my hands under her, gently cradling her head in my hands as her hard she gradually quiet. I use my link with her to try and determine her pain level. It’s still high but not quite as had. I move my pelvis gingerly verifying that the fie waspleted and in the correct ce but doing so results in several frightened yelps from Lilly before she breaks down crying again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It’s okay baby. Just checking where I’m at. I’m sorry this has been so rough on you. I had no intention to hurt you like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shakes her head hard as Iy gentle, chaste kisses along her neck and   jaw&lt;/i&gt;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was a baby, Demetri.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sobs lightly near my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I was only three when the rogue raped and killed my mom, when he raped me. Six when dad started training me for my partner and ten when he found a way to simte the mating knot. I wasn’t ready. I was just a baby.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She breaks down again as I tighten my hold on her. I knew she had it bad but never dared to imagine this possibility with my luna.</p>
