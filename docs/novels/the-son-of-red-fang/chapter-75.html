                <p>“That’s still a significant amount of injuries .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie nods as he adds in more. “Dr. Carter said his ribs were in various stages of healing just like all the bruises we see on his body. Although  Cole  wasn’t happy about it, arrangements were made between the three of them for Cole to stay with us while he healed. Even though he still couldn’t see Cole tied his name agreeing to stay two weeks under dad’s care. I’m certain he only agreed so he could get out of the hospital. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The level of anxiety I’ve seen from him just today would lead me to believe the same. Was there ever a time that he stoppeding to your dad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes. Him and dad got into a major argument at the end of the two weeks with us. Once Cole left the hospital, every day for the two weeks he was  with  us dad would disappear and not even mom knew what he was doing. On thest  day  Cole had to be with us dad disappeared for several hours. When  he  came back he walked very stiffly and was in a lot of pain when he sat down. Mom immediately started asking what was wrong but he didn’t answer until  Cole  stormed in. I had never seen Cole so angry. His wolf was on the surface, his eyes  were divpletely ck and his aura was strong and wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mom shooed everyone out of the dining area as they started into their argument. He repeatedly asked him why didn’t he tell him about his father’s request for him. Dad repeatedly told him that he couldn’t handle it. He wasn’t healed enough. They kept going for half an hour. I’m certain dad was  just  letting him vent. I came back out and sat on the stairs listening to them. I could tell by his  voice  that Cole  was   crying  and dad was trying tofort him. He kept saying that he was sorry. That our family didn’t deserve the trauma that hase from knowing, from seeing how bad things were for him. When dad tried to argue against that point he yelled at dad that he knows I’m taking medication for ptsd. That he  was  the reason  I  had to be medicated when I was fine before he got there. He was sorry that he was selfish, that he allowed us to get too close to him. How all he wanted was the love of a real family, but instead of being able to love us back all he’s done is bring us mental and now, physical, pain. He told dad that he was considered an adult in the eyes of the council and it was time for him to figure out how to protect himself. He would no longer rely on dad when he  was  weak as doing so was nothing more than a crutch. Now that he understood what his father was willing to do to those he allowed into his world he could no longer stay. That he was done. I heard him leave right after that. He came back around midnight three dayster to gather what few things he had there and returned to the pack house. I found out from dad that Cole did not injure himself while gone and when he had returned they were able to talk about what happened. Cole was steadfast on no longering to him for help but did relent on keeping the enchanted key. He promised toe by for dinner once a month when in the territory and told dad that alpha had finally finished the paperwork necessary for him to go to his first pack as a prospect. He was turning twenty–one in a few weeks and  was  excited to leave the territory for a few months. He was leaving Monday for the White Mountain pack. He was sorry that he blew  up  on him. He didn’t deserve that kind of reaction after he had just taken a belting from his father instead of sending him. He thanked him and told him about how much he had grown to love all of us. That we were his true family and he would rather die than to  see  us hurt. He was hopeful that he would be able to use his time as a prospect to find a new pack to live in, preferably one that has his mate as long as the alpha isn’t an ass like his father.”</p>
