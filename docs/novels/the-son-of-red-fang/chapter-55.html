                <p>It’splete pandemonium as I walk into the dining hall. The rest of Cole’s pack pisses me off almost instantly as I see two active fist fights going on  with  everyone in the hall actively encouraging them to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let all the pent up frustration as to how this pack is treating Cole out in a single room echoing roar that no wolf can deny or so I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About half of those circling the ones fighting drop to one knee in submission. The reaction I prefer to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The ten of you that submitted, grab a chair at the table on the other side of the building.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They immediately jump to their feet and scramble across the room, quickly finding a seat. I walk over to the ongoing fight with Damian, Dominic, Patrick and Parker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The nine of you still standing around those that are fighting. You will go</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stand by the wall, now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice booms, bouncing easily off the walls. They don’t react quite as quickly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would have liked dying my ability to intervene in the fights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Move!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I try again to get them out of the way but only seeded in getting more  of  them in my  way  .   I  growl again as my frustration grows and grab the wolf  in  front of me by the neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Move to the wall! Now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I growl loudly as I shove him away. Finally he’s moving but not  very  quickly. Dominic and Damian quickly realize that these wolves are as stubborn  as  they are childish and start assisting me in grabbing them by the neck and shoving them towards the wall as I had instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Everyone still standing will submit against the wall, now!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put all of my alpha into themand and finally  see  results as everyone freezes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There are two wolves on the ground bleeding heavily from their noses and mouths while the two standing are in nearly the same shape. I growl out my frustration once again trying to figure out what to do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Dominic, do you have a pen and paper nearby?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Yes sir.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Go get it quickly.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can hear Dominic hurry off without even looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ You”I point to the one standing farthest from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What’s your name ? ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Das.”  He   states  curtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Damian, escort Das to the bathroom. He gets two minutes to wash the blood from his face and hands, then hees back and stands against  the  wall.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damian motions towards Das, and surprisingly, he follows silently. I point to the  next  one standing. Name!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“ Richard.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s a little more respectful than Dak when speaking hit Hol much .   *Parker. when   you see Damianing back yott   take Richard And do the  thing.  My out to the closest one the floot. He hesitates a moment</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but fake it reaches， out to me anyway .  “ Your  name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>him up. “Andrew . ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You will go with Damian once Parkeres back.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gives me a short To Him but it A the to nod before looking ground. I walk for him to take to orient himself takes moment one sitting a  few  feet to thest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>when hand. He my sways a bit ground. Out of the four he looks on the me to ce my he reaches his feet causing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WOTSE   other  hand on his side.“ What’s your name?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ask a bit calmer than I did with the rest.“Jamison but everyone calls me Jamie.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He’s quiet and by far the most submissive of the four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Patrick, I was going to assign you something else when Dominic came back with the pen and paper but I think Jamie needs to be examined by a doctor. Take him to the medical wing please. Let him clean up before Dr. Morrison gets to him. Dr. Pierce is quite busy between taking all of Ms. Stonemen’s patients in addition to hers and taking care of Cole.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Is he okay, Alpha? We haven’t seen him since this morning.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m actually shocked at Jamie’s concern for Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“He’s rough but okay. I can’t tell you much as that’s his private business but I can assure you that he’s receiving all the appropriate medical care that he needs. I’ll let him know you asked about him. I’m sure he’ll appreciate your concern for him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamie just stands and stares into my eyes instead of going with Patrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Jamie?” Hisck of movement is starting to concern me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Are you lying, Alpha?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m shocked at his statement and remain speechless for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*Alpha Redmen always says he’s being taken care of whenever he disappears but he never is. ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Why are you even concerned about that good for nothing Cole? Haven’t you heard the rumors about how cruel and heartless he is ?  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I see Parker start walking away from the group towards the bathroom signaling me to Das’s return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Have you ever spent time with him, Das? He actually spent two years with dad and I learning dad’s carpentry trade. It took  a  long time for him to  rx  and talk easily with us. He’s very private and doesn’t talk a lot. Disappears a lot too. Sometimes for weeks at a time.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I have no interest in a rapist. He deserves to be beaten into the ground every day for the shit he does. Most recent rumor is that he has been raping our</p>
                
                
                
                <p>future luna.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I don’t believe that Das.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Believe what you want but that freak is a pedophile and a rapist. Haven’t you seen all the pups thate and go from his room?  They  often stay the night for two to three nights then the girlse out marked like he’s their mate. Probably rapes them while he marking them. I saw a seven year olde out of his roomst week with a bite mark. He deserves the beat down he got Saturday.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand up stopping Jamison from speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What did you see of that?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Das scoffs. “Not much alpha. Those of using to this run knew that Alpha Redmen was looking for him but we were instructed not to touch him. By the time we reported him as being in the pack house to alpha he had escaped to his room. Somehow alpha can’t even get into it. Saturday evening, his brother and future alpha, Andre, ran into him. What I saw was Andre pushing him towards Alpha Redman’s office. Cole fought back, tried to run off but got caught and Alpha embedded his foot into Cole’s stomach over a dozen times. Alpha then forced him to his feet, used his belt to tie his hands behind his back and took him back to the training room. It took a while but alpha got him screaming like a girl before he was done with him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>anxiety</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I see.”  I  speak quietly. “Jamison, if you would like to verify Cole’s care  I  will give you permission to see him very briefly. He’s currently in a ma induced asthma attack and he’s not reacting normally to any type  of  stimulus  so   I  can’t allow him visitors until I move him to the second floor of the pack house. I’m hopeful that we will have him back at the training dormitory Saturday morning. Now I need you to go with Patrick.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jamison finally starts moving towards the  door .</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Patrick, if you see Cole start thrashing around it’s important that you get Ang to interrupt the dream. They get pretty bad.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“  Yes  sir.” He states as he starts towards the door himself.</p>
