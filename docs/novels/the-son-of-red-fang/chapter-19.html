                <p>Suddenly my chest cramps up badly and I can’t help but fight everyone around me. I hear Dr. Pierce instructing Alpha ck as to what she needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Demetri, I need that mask to stay on him and I need space to listen to what his lungs are doing when he’s like this.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As  hard as I’m fighting, Alpha manages to keep the mask on me without smashing it to my face like most others have. Dr. Pierce manages to stay gentle with me as well while I’m starting to panic from theck of air moving through my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“You’ve gotten real tight on me and your oxygen level has dipped badly. I know this hurts bad but I need you to submit to us, let us do all the work. All I need from you is to breathe. I’m going to get a different mask and put more medication in the nebulizer. Demetri, if you can, go ahead and try toy with him. This amount of stress is going to drop his body temperature and Dr. Carter already told me he tends to run on the low side. He’s going to need your body heat until we get everything done that we need.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listen as she starts rushing around trying to find what she wants for me while Alpha calls his beta over to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Pat, I’m going to need you to hold the mask near his face as I get close to him.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I start my weak fight  as  I hear hime over to me. I’m having a hard time with the idea of someone who doesn’t know me and has already suggested that I leave helping to take care of me. Unfortunately my chest is the tightest it’s been since the asthma attack started and my weakness is showing badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He makes his way over to us, standing near the back of my head. It only takes a few seconds for the switch to be made and the alpha makes his way around to the front of me. My eyes are open as he stops, watching as he takes his shoes off. He sits on the side of the bed beforeying on his side facing me.  I’ve  frozen up in fear and I can feel everything shaking now that he’s this close to me. He must see the fear in my eyes when he looks at me as he starts slowing down and talking with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“This is exactly as I exined before. I’m going to hold you. Help you stay still while Dr. Pierce puts the IV in. You’re still struggling badly with both anxiety and asthma and it’s important that we get both under control.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m gasping hard and I’m struggling with not being able to open my mouth with the mask being held to my face. I start moving again with the intent of getting the mask off but Beta Patrick isn’t quite as forgiving  as  the alpha. He pushes the mask harder against my face as I fight which only increases my efforts to get away. To my benefit, Alpha notices my stress and quickly intervenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Rx with me Cole. Pat, I need you to let go and see if Ang, needs your help with anything.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately let go of the mask and walks away silently. I don’t hear anything from him until he gets to Dr. Pierce, even then I don’t understand what he’s saying over my hard wheezing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feel the alpha’s hand on the back of my head causing me to startle. I try to yelp and pull away from his touch but my soundes out strangled at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. I need you toe near me. Remember I told you that I wouldn’t put you in restraints to do the IV but I never said you wouldn’t be restrained.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nod my head in recognition of his statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I need you to move close to me. Lay your head on my arm  so   I  can use my body to help keep you from iling around once she starts .  ”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I’m shaking badly but I follow his instructions and move my body towards his. I stop short of actuallyying on his arm. Despite his clear instructions to do so there’s been many times that my father has given me contradictory instructions just so he could punish me for doing one  over  the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, instead of insisting on meing closer Alpha Demetri moves towards me instead. It takes everything I  have  to control my instincts to flee, not that I  have  the energy to do it with.</p>
