                <p>A smug grin spread across lvy&#39;s lips as she raised her voice for all to hear. &#34;Grace, are you serious? You want us to believe that&#39;s an Aesthetic Atelier original?That coat looks like it wandered in from a thrift shop!And you expect us to buy that it&#39;s one-of-a-kind?Who do you take us for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, Demi covered her mouth to hide a giggle.&#34;Please, Grace. Aesthétic Atelier is so exclusive that even celebrities get waitlisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the onlookers, she flashed a bold wink.&#34;Tell me I&#39;m wrong,people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled through the gathering crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, she slid her hand into her coat and pulled out a black business card that gleamed under the store lights. &#34;Should I call the brand&#39;s director for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shimmer on the card caught every curious eye.Aesthetic Atelier&#39;s gold-stamped VIP No.001 was embossed across the surface like royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock froze lvy&#39;s expression. That card was legendary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aesthetic Atelier only handed out a select few worldwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was disbelief in Demi&#39;s voice as she exclaimed,&#34;You have got to be kidding me! That is definitely a fake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between the two of them, lvy and Demi had heard every Chapter of Grace&#39;s life before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace came up through foster care. She was no stranger to struggle. Who on earth would give her any real status?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace saw no point in arguing. &#34;Look, there&#39;s a shop up ahead. Let&#39;s see what the cashier says.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine!&#34; barked Demi, digging in her heels. She wasn&#39;t backing down without a fight. She needed to expose Grace-prove she didn&#39;t belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Aesthetic Atelier store, a clerk took the coat gently and examined it from collar to hem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This here&#39;s our anniversary release-Nieve. There&#39;s only one. The material&#39;s extremely delicate. We don&#39;t even clean it in-store. We send it to HQ and, fair warning, the cleaning cost&#39;s brutal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivy and Demi stared in stunned silence, their disbelief written across their faces. It never occurred to them that Grace&#39;s coat could actually be the real deal from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aesthetic Atelier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, their minds reeled.How expensive could cleaning a coat even be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, lvy pulled out her credit card and waved it at the cashier. &#34;Go ahead and swipe it. We don&#39;t have all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Grace had somehow faked her way into that designer coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories from the orphanage popped up. Wealthy folks used to drop off high-end clothes, hoping for good press. It wouldn&#39;t be a surprise if Grace grabbed one to impress everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought lvy a sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes dragged by, and the transaction still hadn&#39;t gone through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed by the delay, lvy leaned forward and demanded, &#34;How much longer is this going to take?This should have been quick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The store clerk offered a tight, almost nervous smile.&#34;Apologies, ma&#39;am. The cleaning service stats at two hundred thousand, and your card&#39;s been declined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivy&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Are you kidding me right now? Are you pulling some sort of scam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, the clerk replied with a steady voice, &#34;That&#39;s the usual charge for this garment. It&#39;s a specialty item,and care doesn&#39;t come cheap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s face turned pale as paper. &#34;Two hundred thousand just for dry cleaning? Who charges that?You might as well rob us instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still composed, the clerk nodded. &#34;Ma&#39;am,that&#39;s what the designer set, and trust me, it&#39;s non-negotiable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivy&#39;s knees buckled slightly, and she gripped the edge of the counter to steady herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t remember a time when life threw something this bizarre at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this? This was in another league. Two hundred thousand just to clean a coat? That was unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, Ivy pinned Grace with a glare sharp enough to cut glass. &#34;You planned all this, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace propped herself against the counter, twirling her phone with a lazy flick. &#34;Your daughter kicked this off, so maybe pay the bill and apologize while you&#39;re at it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer, her tone barely above a whisper,yet it cut sharper than a knife. &#34;Wrecking someone&#39;s property that costs more than a grand could send you</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to court. And two hundred thousand? You&#39;ll be behind bars for that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear rippled through Ivy&#39;s chest, though she forced herself to appear unfazed. &#34;It really isn&#39;t a problem.We never refused to pay up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger welled up inside her. If she could, she would have strangled Grace on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that every bit of this chaos was on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing no other way out, she pulled out her phone and called her husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Luke was locked in a boardroom,sweating under the gaze of impatient shareholders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibration of his phone was almost ignored until Ivy&#39;s desperate message made him pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just what have you dragged us into this time?&#34; Luke growled, barely able to make sense of her frantic words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he grasped the situation, he unleashed a string of curses as he sent the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Problems seemed to come at him non-stop. He wondered how he was supposed to keep it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He squeezed his eyes shut,feeling wiped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Grace walked away,his company had started to unravel. Several major clients walked out. The tech team bailed. Even the bank became impossible to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, it felt as if the family had become haunted, chased by bad luck with Grace&#39;s name on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the transfer complete, lvy didn&#39;t waste a second.She shoved her card at the cashier, eager to finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a tense pause, Demi finally blurted out an apology, &#34;Grace, I&#39;m sorry for what happened to your coat. I&#39;ll make sure it doesn&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace just nodded, replying, &#34;I don&#39;t always let things slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting another minute, she walked away and met with Adrianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s hands balled into fists, nails digging in, as she glared after Grace. Anger swirled in her chest, almost numbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; whispered Demi, her voice trembling, &#34;are we seriously letting her go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scowling, lvy shoved her card into her purse and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>seized Demi&#39;s arm. &#34;Let&#39;s go home. Your dad&#39;s already furious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, they rushed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her own mind, lvy vowed through clenched teeth that she&#39;d make sure Grace paid for this.</p>
