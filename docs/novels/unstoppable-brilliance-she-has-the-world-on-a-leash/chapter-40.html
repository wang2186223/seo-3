                <p>Julia nearly sneered. In her view, Eliana clearly forgot whose sacrifices had built the Holden name into something worth fighting over. The nerve of these people, daring to cast suspicion on her daughter, left Julia burning with indignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk played across Eliana&#39;s lips. &#34;So she&#39;s a miracle doctor now, is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna jumped in, eager to add, &#34;I heard Grace even made special pills for Aunt Julia. She said they can treat all kinds of sickness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? She&#39;s out there making medicine? Where&#39;s her license? Julia, you must be out of your mind to believe her crap!&#34; Eliana exclaimed, her expression one of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Julia, taking random pills is reckless.Who knows what might happen if things go sideways? And honestly, we don&#39;t much about Grace&#39;s past,&#34; Claire Robertson, chimed in, ever eager to back up her mother Eliana. Her words hung heavy in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s patience snapped. His voice cut through the tension. &#34;Claire, you&#39;re speaking out of turn. Grace is family, and you&#39;ll treat her as such.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Eliana attempted to patch things up.&#34;Rodger, you know Claire means well. She&#39;s just looking out for you guys. You should be more cautious with anything Grace gives you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to worry. Since I started taking those pills, my energy returned, my skin glowed, and I&#39;ve been sleeping like a baby. The doctor said my health is perfect, so there&#39;s no reason for concern,&#34; Julia said,her face lit with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deepening frown crept across Eliana&#39;s face. The sight of both Rodger and Julia swayed by Grace left her stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This situation, if unchecked, might one day see Rodger&#39;s fortune slipping right into Grace&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the staircase landing, Grace paused, her delicate fingers curling around the banister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her gaze, masking a brief, cold glint in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Eliana,&#34; she called out, breaking the uneasy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana turned around, her gaze landing on Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a plain white shirt and a pair of jeans, Grace looked serene. Her skin held a ddelicate glow, and her  steady eyes gave away nothing of her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| may not know everything, but I do know what courtesy looks like. It&#39;s one thing to speak freely with your own family, but out in the world, people would just call it bad manners,&#34; said Grace, a faint smile tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept up Clair&#39;s cheeks. &#34;How dare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet step closer, Grace lowered her voice.&#34;Claire, have restless nights been haunting you? Do you often wake,startled,long before dawn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear flickered in Claire&#39;s eyes. &#34;How do you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those circles beneath your eyes hint at exhaustion,maybe even something deeper,&#34; Grace explained,easing back and letting her voice carry across the room. &#34;Would you like to try my calming pills? I promise they&#39;ll help you feel better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Eliana yanked Claire away. &#34;Enough with these games!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One quick glance at Eliana, Grace&#39;s gaze grew serious.&#34;You&#39;re not well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through Eliana. &#34;If anyone&#39;s sick, it&#39;s you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shot up, intent on striking, but Grace&#39;s reflexes proved faster, her grip firm on Eliana&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise overtook Eliana as she struggled, unable to break free from Grace&#39;s hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that tense moment, Grace spoke with unnerving calm. &#34;I wish I was wrong, but it&#39;s advanced stomach cancer. If you wait any longer, there won&#39;t be much anyone can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana froze, her face ashen. &#34;You-you&#39;re lying! I&#39;ll make you regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear sent Claire stumbling forward, yelling, &#34;Stop it!Don&#39;t say such things about my mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting go of Eliana&#39;s wrist, Grace kept her voice steady. &#34;Aunt Eliana, I&#39;d like to ask-have you noticed more frequent stomach aches, a fading appetite, or perhaps you&#39;re losing weight without trying? Do you ever feel sick or vomit after eating, even small meals?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s eyes narrowed, her lips quivering. Those symptoms had been troubling her for weeks, but she&#39;d written them off as nothing more than a mild case of gastritis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, every word from Grace lined up perfectly with her complaints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of concern crossed Rodger&#39;s face. &#34;Grace,that&#39;s a serious accusation. You can&#39;t make such claims on a whim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes steady, Grace responded, &#34;Dad, I&#39;m not making wild claims. If you have doubts, let Aunt Eliana get a gastroscopy. The results will tell the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s nerves were on edge. &#34;Eliana, why not get checked right away? It&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ordinarily, Julia would never side with Eliana, but some situations called for setting aside grudges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a dismissive laugh, Eliana replied, &#34;Pretending you know everything! I feel just fine, so don&#39;t waste your breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire added, &#34;Exactly, Mom! Let&#39;s not waste any more time. She&#39;s only trying to scare you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their retreat had almost reached the door when Grace&#39;s voice cut through the air. &#34;One month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana hesitated mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unflinching, Grace watched her go. &#34;If you don&#39;t get checked within a month, not even a miracle will pull you back. The cancer has already started its work,but treatment is still possible. Refuse, and you&#39;ll be signing your own fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen with shock, Eliana refused to look back,dragging Claire with her as she hurried away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence settled, and Rodger studied Grace with unease. &#34;Grace, is there any chance you&#39;re mistaken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a small, resolute nod. &#34;Dad, I never make light of matters like this. Please try to convince her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s concern had always come from loyalty to her parents. Anyone else&#39;s trouble meant little to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia was worried. &#34;What if Eliana refuses to get checked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes, Grace replied quietly, &#34;If she turns her back on her own life, we can&#39;t help her. No one can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Rodger let out a weary sigh. &#34;I&#39;ll do my best to change her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, giving the warning was enough. Eliana&#39;s future now rested in her own hands.</p>
