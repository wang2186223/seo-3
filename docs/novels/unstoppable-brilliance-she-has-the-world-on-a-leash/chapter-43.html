                <p>Dominick quickly responded, &#34;I&#39;ll get everything prepared right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, he bolted out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s deep-set eyes lingered on Grace&#39;s delicate profile, and a slight smirk played on his lips. &#34;That&#39;s strange. I don&#39;t recall ever being diagnosed with a decrease in sexual function.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s cheeks turned a shade pinker at the remark.&#34;Of course, you wouldn&#39;t know. After all, you are not a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton found himself at a loss for words. Alright then. If the doctor had said it, who was he to argue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Dominick had everything ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time for the bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strip down and soak in there for an hour. You will need to do this every day for the next month. It&#39;s a medicinal bath I have prepared with care. It&#39;s great for flushing out toxins and reinforcing your muscles,&#34; Grace explained smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton had endured the effects of poison for so long that his organs had sustained significant damage.After a majority of the poison was cleared, the special bath would help gradually restore and strengthen his internal systems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton removed his clothes and stepped into the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace then began using a specialized tool to flush out the poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her movements were sharp, precise, and efficient,completing the procedure flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors observing from outside were already in shock. Everyone glanced at one another, eyes wide with shock and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to accept what he was seeing, Rodney broke the silence. &#34;Even if she struck the correct acupoints, if she fails to cure him and delays proper treatment, she couId be held legally accountable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain his mounting excitement, another doctor blurted out, &#34;Could it be the long-lost Revival Technique?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor wearing glasses adjusted them with trembling fingers. &#34;Yes, I heard that technique could work magic.But it has been lost for over a century. Legend says only Dr. Q ever mastered it. How could someone so young have learned something so rare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick, who knew little about medicine, stood quietly nearby. But watching the astonishment on the faces of these renowned doctors, he couldn&#39;t help but look at Grace with a newfound sense of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, inside the steam-filled bathroom, the rich,earthy scent of herbs hung thick in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton rested against the edge of the tub, eyes closed,as the warm, herb-infused water surrounded him. A faint tingling spread across his skin, a sensation that was oddly relaxing despite the underlying discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stood nearby, the specialized tool in hand, her gaze sharp and focused as she studied his every reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton slowly opened his eyes, the mist making his already deep gaze seem even more intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It hurts a little,&#34; he murmured, his voice low and slightly rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a slight nod. &#34;That&#39;s expected. The herbs are taking effect, and the toxins in your system are flushing out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a beat, then added, &#34;But if the pain gets too much to bear, just say so. I&#39;ll adjust the dosage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s lips tugged upward, a playful glint flickering in his eyes.&#34;Are you worried about me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm flush crept up Grace&#39;s ears, but she masked it with practiced ease, turning her face away.&#34;I&#39;m a doctor. Looking after my patients is part of the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton let out a chuckle, saying nothing further, and allowed his eyes to drift shut again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace exhaled softly, a barely noticeable sigh of relief escaping her lips, though her heart still pounded erratically. Even while submerged in a medicinal bath,this man exuded a commanding presence that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hour later, Colton rose from the tub, water cascading down the contours of his sculpted muscles his physique a perfect blend of strength and symmetry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace swiftly handed him a towel, her eyes darting away almost reflexively. &#34;Dry off and get dressed. You don&#39;t want to catch a cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton accepted the towel, taking his time as he patted himself dry, his gaze trailing lazily to her flushed ears, a spark of amusement dancing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is your face so red?&#34; he asked. Grace stiffened, forcing a stern look onto her features.&#34;It&#39;s just too hot in here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton let out a low chuckle. &#34;Is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to let the teasing continue, Grace turned briskly toward the door. &#34;I&#39;ll go prepare the herbs for tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she took a few steps, a warm, steady hand suddenly closed around her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stopped in her tracks and slowly turned back to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton looked at her deeply and said in a low and steady voice, &#34;Thank you, Grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those simple words sent a ripple through Grace&#39;s heart. She bit her lower lip gently and replied softly &#34;I&#39;m only doing what I&#39;m supposed to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton held her gaze for a long, thoughtful moment before slowly letting go of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace quickly turned and stepped out of the bathroom,her heartbeat thudding in her chest like a war drum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the team of doctors was still whispering among themselves, deep in discussion about Grace&#39;s medical skills. When Grace stepped out, they turned toward her, awe and disbelief written across every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was difficult for them to believe that someone so young could possess medical abilities far beyond their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particularly doubtful doctor couldn&#39;t resist the urge to examine Colton the moment he stepped out only to be left completely dumbfounded and thoroughly convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a subtle smile, then turned her attention toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The curious doctor leaned forward and asked, &#34;What are you looking at? Is there something unusual outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace glanced at him and replied coolly, &#34;Just checking to see if pigs are flying. I&#39;ve never seen that happen before either.&#34;</p>
