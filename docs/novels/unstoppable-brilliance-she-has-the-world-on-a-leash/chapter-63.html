                <p>&#34;Dr. Chadwick, you&#39;re finally here! I&#39;ve been waiting for you forever. Please, come quickly-my mother needs surgery right away. She&#39;s in critical condition!&#34;Claire&#39;s eyes shimmered with tears of relief as she caught sight of Kevin. His arrival felt like grasping a lifeline after hours of drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was surrounded by relatives, yet none could offer the kind of help her mother desperately needed. Only a skilled doctor could turn things around, and Kevin&#39;s presence finally gave her a sliver of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire and her mother had always leaned on each other. Her father hadn&#39;t even bothered to show up-not even when his wife&#39;s life hung by a thread. All because she hadn&#39;t given him a boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; Kevin said, his tone even but serious.&#34;But after reviewing Mrs. Robertson&#39;s case, I must be honest-her condition is extremely complicated.Even with my experience, the operation only has a fifty-fifty chance of success. Unless...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless his mentor, the legendary Dr. Q, was here to assist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Claire cut in, her voice tight with urgency, &#34;I believe in you. Even if there&#39;s just a fifty percent chance, it&#39;s still worth it-for my mom&#39;s life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Claire, those odds were better than none. She&#39;d rather fight with hope than stand by and lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid Kevin might second-guess his decision,she quickly added, her voice filled with emotion, &#34;It means so much that you came. I know people wait over a year just to get an appointment with you. We&#39;re only this lucky because of my uncle Carl&#39;s persistence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your uncle Carl?&#34; Kevin repeated, then turned toward the man in question, his brows lifting slightly.&#34;I was invited by Mr. Rodger Holden. Your uncle Carl had nothing to do with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin had a fair grasp of the Holden family&#39;s inner workings. Had it not been for a past favor from Rodger, he never would&#39;ve made this special trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Claire blinked, clearly caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re all family here. No need to get stuck on the details,&#34; Carl said with a forced chuckle, quickly trying to defuse the tension. &#34;Let&#39;s focus on Eliana&#39;s treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was true-Rodger had contacted Kevin. But due to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>business obligations, he&#39;d sent Carl in his place.Claire&#39;s assumption had simply gone uncorrected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet,mocking chuckle slipped from Grace,who had remained silent until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors about Carl weren&#39;t flattering-most called him incompetent and arrogant. Now, it seemed, he was also eager to bask in credit he hadn&#39;t earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you laughing at?&#34; Claire started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s surprised and genuinely delighted voice cut her off. &#34;Miss Miller! What a surprise-what brings you here?&#34; He hadn&#39;t noticed her until that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The patient inside is my aunt,&#34; Grace replied,composed and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? The patient is your aunt?&#34; Kevin&#39;s eyebrows shot up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Claire and the rest, he said with unmistakable certainty, &#34;With my mentor here, there was no need to call me at all! She&#39;s more than capable of handling this surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His statement stunned everyone into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time is critical. Miss Miller, would you join me in the operating room?&#34; Kevin asked, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of assisting his mentor in surgery electrified him. He was already glad he&#39;d come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Dr. Chadwick, are you seriously letting Grace assist you?&#34; Gianna asked, her voice thick with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin&#39;s expression turned cold. &#34;I&#39;m assisting her,not the other way around. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna stood frozen, her jaw nearly hitting the floor.Had she misheard? No-she hadn&#39;t. It was SO unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kevin had no interest in arguing. Time was slipping through their fingers. He turned back to Grace with quiet respect, silently urging her to lead the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going in now. Don&#39;t worry about Aunt Eliana.I won&#39;t let anything happen to her,&#34; Grace said confidently, casting a reassuring glance at her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, go on. I believe in you!&#34; Julia replied, her voice filled with pride and trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, though visibly surprised, was no fool.Watching the reverence doctor showed toward his daughter, he understood one thing clearly-Grace wasn&#39;t just capable. She was extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Grace and Kevin moved swiftly toward the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pre-op room, their footsteps echoing down the hall as the rest of the Holden family remained behind-silent,each lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna sat stiffly, her expression clouded wvith disbelief.She couldn&#39;t fathom how someone raised in an orphanage could possess such advanced medical skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea gnawed at her. Maybe Grace had seduced Kevin into backing her? It wouldn&#39;t be the first time a beautiful woman used charm to gain influence.Perhaps this was all part of her plan-to win the Holden family&#39;s trust and secure Eliana and Claire&#39;s gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt more believable the more she considered it.Kevin was young and single, so it made sense that Grace would enchant him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After over fifteen hours of this extremely difficult and sophisticated procedure, the operating room light finally turned out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Eliana was wheeled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is my mom?&#34; Claire inquired, with a worried expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the rest gathered around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, the surgery went really well,&#34; Grace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replied, taking off her mask.</p>
