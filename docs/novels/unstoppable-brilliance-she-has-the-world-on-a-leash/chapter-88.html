                <p>Grace&#39;s soft smile, paired with her gentle words, sent a comforting warmth right through Adrianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of affection made Adrianna&#39;s heart skip. If she wasn&#39;t careful, she&#39;d end up idolizing Grace outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe rolled her eyes at the whole display, not bothering to hide her annoyance. &#34;Wow, the friendship here is so moving I might cry. Listen,Beatrice is set on getting that beauty cream. If you refuse her, Johnny&#39;s going to be furious, and life with the Holdens will turn ugly for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Grace arched an eyebrow. &#34;Turn ugly for me?You do realize, right? My mom absolutely dotes on me-she&#39;s never been one to favor sons. I get spoiled far more than Johnny ever has.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, Grace might have doubted her place,but now there was no question: Julia treated her like a little princess, showering her with love and luxuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, a sly edge in her voice, &#34;Didn&#39;t you catch Johnny&#39;s latest complaint to Beatrice? My mom&#39;s a platinum member at every major designer house.The shoes, the bags, the clothes she buys for me-they&#39;re all limnited edition, bought in sets. Johnny only gets that kind of attention at Christmas and his birthdays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to women like Chloe, nothing worked better than highlighting the exact things they longed for most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Chloe let out a huff. &#34;You spoiled brat,&#34; she spat, her jealousy plain as day, but she had no choice but to stalk off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she turned to leave, Grace&#39;s voice rang out,cold and clear. &#34;And Chloe, you might want to tell Beatrice this: if she betrayed Johnny, she&#39;d better be ready for payback. Don&#39;t say | didn&#39;t give fair warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you implying? Beatrice would never betray Johnny!&#34; Chloe stopped in her tracks, caught off guard. She tried to sound indignant, but the defensiveness in her voice betrayed her. &#34;Quit trying to start trouble between them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace just lifted her shoulders in a small shrug,opting to let the conversation drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture only made Chloe more certain that Grace was out to cause drama. She shot Grace one last scowl before storming off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Chloe&#39;s figure disappeared down the hall, Grace&#39;s mind started to turn over what she&#39;d just seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, Beatrice&#39;s involvement with an older man was something even Chloe didn&#39;t know about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, what girl would ever confess to her friend that she had found herself a sugar daddy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In any case, Grace doubted Chloe would prove loyal if things got ugly. Their friendship struck her as shallow, more convenient than genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Chloe was gone, Adrianna stepped closer and said softly, &#34;Grace, there&#39;s something I haven&#39;t told you. The truth is... my parents aren&#39;t ordinary</p>
                
                
                
                <p>workers. They&#39;re actually in the military...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words tangled on her tongue, and for a moment she simply fell silent, unsure how to explain without saying too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the sensitive nature of her parents&#39; work -always shrouded in secrecy-she was bound by more than just family loyalty. Even she was kept in the dark about the true details of their assignments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace caught the hesitation and responded with easy reassurance, &#34;You don&#39;t have to explain anything to me. I&#39;m not like Chloe or Beatrice-I don&#39;t get hung up on background or status. All I want is for you to stay yourself, and for our friendship to stay solid.&#34; Power and poverty meant little in Grace&#39;s eyes; she&#39;d met people from every walk of life, and none of it ever changed what really mattered to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace,you really are the best! Honestly, if I were a guy, l&#39;d propose to you on the spot!&#34; Adrianna threw her arms around Grace, utterly delighted, the picture of a devoted fan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was truth in Grace&#39;s words-so long as they stayed true to themselves, nothing could threaten the bond they shared. All those other details faded into insignificance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace paused, a hint of mischief in her eyes. &#34;Well,technically, we&#39;re not old enough for marriage yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Romantic feelings for women had never sparked in her,and there wasn&#39;t a man on her radar either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her mind was set on her life and goals-romance could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Chloe was fuming elsewhere. &#34;Isn&#39;t it ridiculous how full of herself Grace Miller has become? First, she refuses to sell her beauty creams for a fair price, then she tries to slander you and wedge herself between you and Johnny! Honestly,she has no shame. People say she&#39;s always seen with strange men in flashy cars-who knows what she&#39;s realy up to? And now she dares accuse you of betraying Johnny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe poured out her loyalty to Beatrice, but her words only made Beatrice&#39;s anxiety grow sharper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already uneasy from guilt, Beatrice couldn&#39;t take Grace&#39;s threats lightly. Waiting around for disaster wasn&#39;t an option-she needed to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget her,&#34; Beatrice retorted, trying to sound confident. &#34;I&#39;ll talk to Johnny myself. If I play it right,he&#39;ll make sure Grace coughs up that cream. Once that&#39;s done, you&#39;ll get your share too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Beatrice&#39;s promise lit up Chloe&#39;s face. She wasted no time in sliding over and looping her arm through Beatrice&#39;s. &#34;You&#39;re amazing, Beatrice. You always look out for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath it all, Chloe was desperate for her own taste of beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what friends are for-I&#39;ll always have your back.&#34; Beatrice assured her, sounding proud and self-assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt in Beatrice&#39;s mind.With Johnny so firmly under her sway, she believed getting what she wanted would be a breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as lunch rolled around, Beatrice wasted no time bringing up the subject with Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you want Grace&#39;s skincare stuff?&#34; Johnny blinked in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, he understood the obsessian girls had with skincare-and he cared plenty about his own looks-but could Grace&#39;s concoctions really be worth all the hype?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but wonder how her products had become such a craze throughout the school.</p>
