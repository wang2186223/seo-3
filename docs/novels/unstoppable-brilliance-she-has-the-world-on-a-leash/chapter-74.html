                <p>As far as the department head was concerned,achieving a perfect score without drawing attention would require real cleverness and strategy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped, &#34;Move it already! If you keep standing around, I&#39;ll pick someone else!&#34; With an exaggerated eye roll, he turned away, clearly done with Ellie and Gianna, and stalked off, leaving them behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simmering with resentment, Gianna forced herself to stay quiet. As soon as she secured her guaranteed admission, that department head would be the first to get a taste of her triumph. Honestly, what made him think he was special? All he had was a family connection to the principal-hardly worth bragging about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie, standing at Gianna&#39;s side, felt her own frustration building. With a track record of top students and consistent spots on the honor roll,both she and Gianna deserved more respect. Yet in front of the department head, their achievements seemed invisible. It was too irritating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how irritated they were, neither wanted to risk losing the spotlight to Grace and Anthony.Together, they hurried off toward the reception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s arrival sent ripples of excitement through the entire campus. Organizers had pulled out all the stops, arranging ceremonial greeters and picking standout students from every class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the crowd, Gianna quickly realized she wasn&#39;t the only one who&#39;d been chosen to greet Terry. Each class had someone there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While a twinge of envy lingered, at least Grace wouldn&#39;t have the stage all to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Grace off to one side, overshadowed by the other representatives, Gianna&#39;s confidence returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Terry had stepped onto the scene. Clad in a simple white casual outfit, he drew the attention of students and school leaders as he moved toward the sprawling lecture hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four sharply dressed bodyguards walked beside him,keeping close, while an assistant managed the details of his visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s reputation preceded him. Many whispered that he&#39;d soon join the ranks of the nation&#39;s top academics. His groundbreaking work in both environmental science and artificial intelligence had left a lasting mark.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A figure of national importance, he had arrived at the school on a talent-scouting mission. Naturally,everyone vied for a sliver of his attention. The possibility that Terry might single them out was too enticing to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Ellie expertly navigating the crowd, Gianna seized her chance to approach Terry, eager to flaunt her credentials and even slipping seamlessly into fluent French as she introduced herself and described her recent publication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Terry looked impressed with her enthusiasm. But then, his expression changed. A puzzled frown crossed his face. &#34;Tell me, why are you speaking a foreign language? There&#39;s not a foreigner in sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s tone held both confusion and subtle disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That open question in front of everyone made Gianna shrink inside, cheeks burning with embarrassment.She&#39;d simply hoped to demonstraté her proficiency in a foreign language. Yet, his question twisted her attempt into something less dignified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few nearby students tried-and failed-to stifle their laughter, only adding to her humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Grace, ever the observer,couldn&#39;t resist muttering under her breath, &#34;What an idiot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prof. Warren, Gianna recently went to France for vacation, and she got so caught up in the environment that she accidentally blurted out some French when she got carried away,&#34; said Ellie,jumping in to shield her student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see,&#34; Terry replied blandly, not pursuing the matter further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, he made his way toward the lecture hall. The crowd behind him scrambled to keep up, not wanting to be left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People had followed without question. That was the power of someone truly capable-no need for extra words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Terry entered, he found the hall already brimming with faculty and students. His arrival was met with a round of eager applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Gianna trying to look important by striding close beside him, she almost played the part of his aide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry launched into his lecture, diving straight into the fast-evolving world of artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Al had become the talk of the town, and with his expertise, Terry broke down its latest trends and future possibilities for everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The coming decade, he explained, would belong to those who could master artificial intelligence. Great fortunes and influence awaited those with the skill to lead in the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plenty of students dreamed of chasing success in Al,though few would truly master it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve read several remarkable papers from you guys.It makes me proud to see such sharp minds taking shape.&#34; Terry&#39;s gaze swept the room, and he looked genuinely pleased. At last, the nation&#39;s young talents were beginning to blossom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Praise from someone of Terry&#39;s stature was a moment of happiness for students and teachers alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Special mention goes to Gianna White, Johnny Holden, and Beatrice Green. Your grasp of artificial intelligence is truly exceptional.&#34;</p>
