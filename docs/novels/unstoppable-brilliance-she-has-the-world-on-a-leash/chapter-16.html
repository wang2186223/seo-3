            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Grace powered up her laptop and navigated straight to the school&#39;s online forum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors had been expected, but the frenzy that greeted her was beyond anything she&#39;d imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bold new thread-&#34;Truth About The New Transfer,Grace Miller&#34;-immediately drew her focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the anonymous source, Grace&#39;s childhood had been spent bouncing between orphanages andfoster homes until finally, the Holden family adopted her. Worse still, the writer insisted she&#39;d used their connections just to get into Briskvale High. And the cherry on top was the insinuation about a luxurious car-a scandal in the making, apparently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slender fingers moved confidently over the keyboard,blue light glinting off her steady expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusations came with so-called proof-a photo of Patrick&#39;s flashy Mercedes parked by the gate,another of her stepping into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments below the post churned with gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Called it! Girls like that are always hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rumor has it she was passed around foster homes in Stranta and never fit in anywhere...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would the Holden family bother adopting her?There&#39;s got to be more to the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smirk tugged at Grace&#39;s lips, but a flicker of coldness crept into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked through to the poster&#39;s profile,but found nothing useful. It was an anonymous account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not even brave enough to use their own name,&#34; she murmured,swiftly capturing screenshots as proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft buzz interrupted her thoughts-Adrianna&#39;s message appeared. &#34;Grace, don&#39;t let the comments get to you. I&#39;m already reporting the thread!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace replied calmly, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s not bothering me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message popped up-Patrick this time.&#34;I saw the forum mess. Want me to take care of it? I can wipe that thread clean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace casually responded, &#34;Already handled it. The post is gone, and the forum is locked down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Places that allowed rumors to spread unchecked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hardly deserved to stay open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick then asked, &#34;Did you track down who started it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I traced the IP to a computer in the school library,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For just one day at school, Grace found it strange how quickly she had become a target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blending in had never been an option. Some people just couldn&#39;t help but target the ones who stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking the issue settled, Grace set the matter aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But shortly afterward, Rodger&#39;s entire family received an urgent summons from Ethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia could only wonder what was going on. Ethel always seemed to end up with a headache when the whole family showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, with Ethel being Rodger&#39;s mother, no one dared refuse the invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace barely stepped through the door before Ethel&#39;s sharp voice cut the air. &#34;Grace, our family&#39;s reputation matters to me. I won&#39;t have you tarnishing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s brow creased. &#34;Ethel, that&#39;s really uncalled for.Grace always shows respect, and she would never do anything like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger mirrored the concern on her face. &#34;Grace has barely settled in. She&#39;s only attended two days at her new school. What could she have possibly done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning,Ethel let out a dismissive laugh and brought an iPad crashing down onto the table.&#34;Take a look at this yourselves! People all over the city are whispering that we&#39;ve brought home a girl with a questionable past!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the screen, screenshots flashed-remnants of a deleted post, now being shared everywhere online and through chat groups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rushed over Julia as she snatched the device.&#34;None of this is true! Grace would never get mixed up in something like this. She&#39;s a wonderful girl...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful, you say?&#34; Ethel interrupted, her glare cutting straight through Grace. &#34;Wonderful enough to spark a scandal her first week here? And just who is that man in the expensive car?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace opened her mouth, but Gianna jumped in first.&#34;Grandma, please don&#39;t work yourself up. That person could just be one of Grace&#39;s friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Friends, is it? Do you honestly think a girl from the orphanage suddenly knows someone so rich? There are girls out there who chase after money without a second thought,&#34; Ethel said, her voice full of warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s gaze turned cold, her composure unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel caught that look and her irritation grew. &#34;Let me make myself clear. Our family&#39;s reputation matters above all else. I will not tolerate any improper behavior from you, not while you are part of the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear to you all, I have never done anything to tarnish the family name. That man truly is my friend,&#34;Grace said, her voice steady and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Julia squeezed Grace&#39;s hand. &#34;I believe every word she says.&#34;,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Julia&#39;s unwavering support, Ethel felt her patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s lips curled in quiet delight. Seeing Ethel&#39;s frustration aimed at Grace left her feeling rather pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on a look of false sympathy, Gianna jumped back into the conversation. &#34;Grandma, you shouldn&#39;t upset yourself. I actually have some wonderful news.Next week, Prof. Warren from Summit University will visit our school for a guest lecture. Ms. Dixon promised to introduce us, and if I make a good impression, I might just secure early admission to Summit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of that name, Ethel&#39;s face brightened.She reached for Gianna&#39;s hand, brimming with excitement. &#34;Is it true? Prof. Warren from Summit?The one whose research was published in &#39;Nature&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna shot a gloating look at Grace before turning back to Ethel, her voice sweet. &#34;Yes. Ms. Dixon says my marks in science are exceptional, so she&#39;s giving me this chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Ellie Dixon,Gianna was her star pupil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s wonderful, just wonderful!&#34; said Ethel, patting Gianna&#39;s hand, her smile making the creases on her face even deeper. &#34;This is what I expect from a Holden. Such accomplishments bring pride, not disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final pointed look at Grace, Ethel made her meaning plain. Grace, meanwhile, showed no reaction,appearing as though none of it concerned her at all.</p>
