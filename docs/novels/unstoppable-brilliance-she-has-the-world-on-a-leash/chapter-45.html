                <p>A gentle smile tugged at Grace&#39;s lips. &#34;You give me too much credit. Maybe luck was just on my side this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment made Gianna&#39;s fists clamp even tighter,her knuckles paling, veins standing out as if her anger might burst through her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement and gossip buzzed through the students around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who ever thought Grace would claim the top spot?Guess Gianna has to settle for silver from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! That&#39;s a massive difference. And listen to Grace-blaming luck. Nobody hits perfect scores just by being lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gianna&#39;s days of being first are finished. Looks like it&#39;s Grace&#39;s turn in the spotlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Summit University&#39;s professor is visiting soon, right?Let&#39;s see which of them catches his eye now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word from the crowd felt like a fresh wound to Gianna, cutting deeper with every whisper. She pressed her nails deep into her palms, barely noticing the pain-every nerve was focused on the sting of their gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,Lizzie stormed forward, unable to stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of you know what you&#39;re talking about! Gianna&#39;s been number one for years! Anyone can have an off day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one missed the shift in the crowd, though.Admiration for Gianna had dimmed, replaced by genuine admiration for Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her back on the gossip, Grace strolled down the hallway, Adrianna falling into step beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at their desks, Grace glanced over at Adrianna,taking in her cheek. It was clear the cream had worked wonders-that stubborn dark mark had faded even more. Soon, it would be gone for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Day by day, Adrianna watched her own skin improve and ached for the moment when her transformation would finally be complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Johnny arrived at the bulletin board much later than everyone else. Helping Beatrice with her things had kept him busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally made his way back, the crowd clustered around the scores was already thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the best of him, and he pushed forward,confident he&#39;d find Grace&#39;s name at the very bottom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind had already raced ahead-he&#39;d report her failure straight to their mother, relishing the thought of seeing her disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the lowest scores, Johnny searched for her name. To his surprise, Grace was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion crept across his face, and his brow furrowed as he scanned the list again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she didn&#39;t even show up for the exams? Or could her scores have been so low that it wasn&#39;t worth putting on the list at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he puzzled over the possibilities, a burst of excitement from the crowd snapped him back. &#34;Wait-Grace Miller actually took first place?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There it was, plain as day-her name shining at the very top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit Johnny hard, his hands clenching tight as he stared. &#34;No way. This can&#39;t be real...&#34; he muttered,disbelief thickening his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories tumbled through his mind-Grace napping in class, scribbling nothing on her homework, finishing exams faster than anyone else. How could someone like that possibly score full marks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evening settled over the Holden home, golden light spilling through the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Johnny spotted Julia moving around</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the dining table, arranging dishes with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back,&#34; she greeted him softly. &#34;Go get cleaned up-dinner&#39;s about to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they gathered around the table, Rodger placed his newspaper down and fixed Johnny with a steady look.&#34;How were your results this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s fork hovered above his plate. He hesitated before mumbling, &#34;It was fine. I made it to the top ten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger nodded once, his voice cool and firm. &#34;Stay focused. I expect you to keep it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it,&#34; Johnny replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s eyes drifted to Grace, who had put down her fork for a moment. Leaning close, she said softly,&#34;Darling, don&#39;t let your grades weigh you down.However you did, you&#39;ll always be my sweet girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry lingered in her tone-Grace&#39;s brother always brought home strong results, and she didn&#39;t want her daughter to feel the weight of comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Grace only smiled, bright and easy. &#34;No need to worry, Mom. I&#39;m not upset. I actualy took first place.Full marks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-first place?&#34; Julia stared, stunned, as her fork slipped from her grasp and clattered against her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s fork stopped halfway to his mouth,his hand trembling as he stared at Grace. &#34;You&#39;re telling me you got full marks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace answered with a small nod, &#34;That&#39;s right.Honestly, it wasn&#39;t that tough, so 1 wasn&#39;t all that surprised by the perfect score.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent look of disbelief passed between the couple.Could it be that their daughter was truly gifted? She breezed through exams that everyone else struggled with-almost without effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea seemed almost unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Johnny swallowed a surge of resentment. What was so special about this anyway?There had to be some kind of fluke behind her score.Maybe she puulled a fast one this time, but next exams she&#39;d fall flat on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking his irritation, Johnny shrugged, keeping his tone cool. &#34;It&#39;s just one result. Don&#39;t set your expectations too high or you&#39;ll end up disappointed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s expression hardened as she shot him a warning look. &#34;Mind your attitude. Your sister came out on top this time, and you didn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s your turn to take a few lessons from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urge to argue flashed in Johnny&#39;s eyes, but with his father watching, he could only mutter through lenched teeth, &#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll learn from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing off his mood, Julia&#39;s joy bubbled over as she scooped more food onto Grace&#39;s plate. &#34;Sweetie, you amaze me. Eat up, you need the energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Grace answered in her usual calm tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy colored Julia&#39;s words as she declared, &#34;This is a reason to celebrate. We&#39;ll mark the occasion-tomorrow we&#39;re going shopping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s quiet chuckle spoke volumes, though he said nothing.Everyone knew Julia never needed much of a reason to spend-and she always found the best deals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone chimed. Julia&#39;s face lit up. &#34;Look at this-Seraphic Jewelry&#39;s having their big members&#39;sale this weekend. What luck! Now&#39;s the perfect chance to treat you to something shiny and new.&#34;</p>
