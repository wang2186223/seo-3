                <p>Gianna, though reluctant, couldn&#39;t oppose the decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost at once, a planformed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting Grace-the awkward outsider-mingle with polished socialites could turn the tables in her favor.Surely, the experience would open Grace&#39;s eyes to how misplaced she truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rooms would be filled with polished young women,every one a perfect picture of grace and refinement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming from the orphanage, Grace would struggle to find her footing among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk flickered at the corners of Gianna&#39;s mouth,with a glint of contempt shining through her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Grace stumbling or faltering in front of that critical audience was already sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that world, heritage and polished manners carried al the weight. How could someone with no background or refinement possibly hope to belong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning arrived with a delivery of gowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the staircase, Gianna immediately noticed the collection of gowns draped across the living room couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked onto a charming yellow gown that immediately drew her in. Its youthful charm,bright and full of life, was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s cheerful voice called out, &#34;Gianna, come try this on and see if it needs any tweaks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling to herself, Gianna approached and trailed her fingers across the soft fabric, clear approval in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is lovely. Thank you for choosing it for me,&#34;she replied gently, her voice smooth and respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia gave her an approving nod. &#34;Go ahead and put it on. If it isn&#39;t a perfect fit, the designer can fix it up in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grateful nod, Gianna gathered the gown and slipped away to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she lingered in front of the mirror, taking in the gown&#39;s refined details-the precise stitches, the airy chiffon, and the elegant embroidery all spoke of expert craftsmanship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she slipped into the gown and caught her reflection, she couldn&#39;t help but twirl, light spilling over her as the skirt fluttered around her legs. She looked every bit the image of radiance, with her skin glowing and her movements full of grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admiring her reflection, she felt certain she embodied everything a socialite should be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every inch of her radiated confidence-she was sure all eyes would be on her that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of Grace&#39;s appearance in a gown sparked a restless curiosity within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs in her gown, she caught Julia&#39;s attention right away. Julia&#39;s face brightened. &#34;Gianna,you look absolutely beautiful, just like a princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced modesty, Gianna lowered her eyes,smiling sweetly, all the while swelling with pride beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a casual glance around the room, she asked,&#34;So, which gown did Grace pick? Has she made a choice yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia gestured toward a different gown, this one a deep blue hue. &#34;The designer chose this for her, thinking it fit her perfectly. The moment I saw it, I knew it was right for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever warmth Gianna had felt was gone the instant her eyes landed on the gown. It was a blue gown,studded with sparkling stones, shimmering with a quiet  at most elegance, more sophisticated than anything she owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Gianna&#39;s grip tightened on her own skirt, jealousy prickling beneath her calm exterior. The gown meant for Grace was inarguably more breathtaking and distinctive than her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit too grown-up? Maybe this design isn&#39;t quite right for her?&#34; Gianna&#39;s smile looked forced, and her tone betrayed her discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle smile, Julia responded, &#34;I disagree.Grace may be young, but she carries herself with a maturity beyond her years. This gown will only set her apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness crept in as Gianna pressed her lips together.Set her apart? Grace was nothing more than an orphan. Why should she be given such a stunning gown?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious now-Julia favored Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, footsteps sounded on the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, come and try your gown on!&#34; Julia&#39;s cheerful voice called out, filled with encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of astonishment crossed Grace&#39;s face when she caught sight of the blue gown, but she quickly smoothed her expression. With gentle hands, she gathered up the gown and quietly made her way upstairs to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the sound of approaching footsteps echoed down the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s head snapped up, and her eyes narrowed in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace took her time coming down, every step highlighting how well the blue gown suited her figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against her flawless skin, the color looked luminous.Her slender figure was complemented by the gown&#39;s elegant cut. Yet, above all, it was Grace&#39;s calm assurance that truly stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s voice brimmed with delight. &#34;Grace, you look absolutely perfect! I just know you&#39;ll turn heads at the event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s because you always know what suits me,&#34;Grace replied with a smile. She felt genuine warmth radiating from this family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from the side, Gianna&#39;s jealousy simmered beneath her pleasant mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Grace looked every inch the princess,regal and composed. Standing beside her, she felt as if her own glow had been dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If nothing changed before the big night, she was certain to become the butt of everyone&#39;s jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since both outfits fit flawlessly, there was no need for adjustments, and the boutique staff quietly departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Grace&#39;s glamorous look continued to gnaw at Gianna. The very idea of being outshone by Grace was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hardly bear to look at her another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting Grace take all the attention was simply not an option, and a new plan began to take shape in her mind.</p>
