                <p>Any sign of enthusiasm vanished from Johnny&#39;s face,leaving him looking completely defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clear favoritism was on display, no question about it.Even his own dad had switched sides, falling into the ranks of those parents who only had eyes for their daughters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, arriving home meant his dad would greet him with questions about his day at school. These days, every conversation seemed to orbit around Grace and her latest achievements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the big deal about having a daughter,anyway? Why was she suddenly the center of the universe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing he knew for sure-if he ever had kids,he would make sure to have a son. Someone who would carry himself with pride and face life head-on.Unbeknownst to him, he would one day have an adorable daughter and would shower her with all the love he could give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening meal offered him at least one consolation. His mother hadIn&#39;t forgotten about him;she appeared at his door with a glass of milk as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the identical &#34;mother-daughter&#34; mugs in their hands, disappointment hit him all over again.Those mugs were rare, the sort of thing you could search for endlessly and never find, even with a fortune to spend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, his own drink came in a flimsy plastic cup,the type handed out for free when you bought groceries. Overlooked once more, Johnny fought back tears he was too proud to let fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed into his room, slammed the door,and nursed his frustration. He made a silent vow to outshine everyone-he would ace his classes, earn a spot at the top university, and make his parents regret not appreciating him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few feet away, laughter and warmth floated from Grace&#39;s room, as if their closeness could seep through the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, James spends most of his time at the office these days... and as for Johnny, he sometimes says things the wrong way, but no one could doubt how much he loves you-maybe even more than I do,&#34;said Julia, her words gentle as she reached for something behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brightly wrapped gift box appeared in her hands as if by magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take a look at what your brothers picked out for you -it&#39;s that special designer collection, the one that&#39;s so hard to find. They might not say it out loud, but there&#39;s no question how much they care. You must accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing seemed off limits for Julia, who tried every possible approach to ensure Grace felt at home,determined to weave her into the family fabric come what may.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Just let them know l&#39;m grateful, okay?&#34;replied Grace, perfectly aware of her mother&#39;s intentions and choosing to play her part with effortless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia didn&#39;t let up. &#34;And... do you get along with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod followed. &#34;I do. They&#39;ve both gone out of their way to make me feel welcome. I&#39;ve never once felt left out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a teasing glint, Julia took it a step further. &#34;So tell me-who holds the top spot in your heart? Me,your brothers, or your dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stopped for a moment, wondering if her mom was actually fishing for affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You, obviously,&#34; answered Grace, her answer flowing out smooth and genuine, but with just the right touch of sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because when it came down to it, no one matched Julia&#39;s level of care. Her father and brothers were wonderful, of course, but the bond with Julia was on another level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A modest smile played on Julia&#39;s lips, but she was bursting inside, already plotting how she&#39;d haul her husband away for a celebratory drink in their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;m going to go find Johnny and talk for a bit before bed. You should get some sleep, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, go ahead! You two should spend more time together. And if you ever get stuck on your assignments, don&#39;t forget, your brother is a top ten student in his class,&#34; remarked Julia, her encouragement brimming with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem,&#34; responded GGrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth be told, Grace never struggled with school-every test came easy to her, so tutoring was hardly on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she did have something important to bring up with Johnny tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Julia departed, her mood light and cheerful,Grace rose from her chair and slipped out into the hallway. She stopped at the next door and gave it a polite knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it? Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing Johnny&#39;s voice, Grace pushed the door open and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had she set foot in his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to hers, Johnny&#39;s space felt dimmer and much smaller. The decor and layout-there really was no contest. No denying it-the contrast stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What brings you here?&#34; asked Johnny, caught off guard by her appearance. Expecting their mom,he hadn&#39;t bothered checking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was left wondering what Grace wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Johnny,&#34; replied Grace, letting out a gentle sigh. &#34;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m here to start trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s calling me tense? What are you doing here,anyway? Don&#39;t telI me you&#39;ve shown up for payback or something,&#34; said Johnny, instantly stiffening as if expecting trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sigh escaped Grace as she rubbed at her temples, choosing not to circle around the issue.&#34;Are you still upset with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle tone colored her words, and her eyes glimmered with such innocence that she looked like a helpless fawn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously-was she really trying to win sympathy with that act?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am still upset. What of it?&#34; Johnny declared,folding his arms and scowling. &#34;And you can save those sad eyes for someone else.I&#39;m not falling for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace spoke softly. &#34;I know you clashed with Mom earlier... and that Dad put a freeze on your allowance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s routine lately had been a mess-nights out,sometimes not even coming home until morning.That behavior was what got his card privileges revoked in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Call it karma, because consequences landed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that day, he had even strutted around bragging to Beatrice about how he&#39;d make sure their parents shut off Grace&#39;s spending. And how did that turn out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their household had always played by the same rule -sons get tough love, daughters get pampered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace ended up with a black card and no limits.Johnny? Stuck with a pitiful debit card and a $5, 000monthly ceiling. He couldn&#39;t help but think it was sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back before Grace arrived, the question of fairness never even crossed his mind. He would scrape together any birthday money, holiday bonuses, and every bit of loose change, just to surprise Beatrice with little gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, his dad even put a freeze on his allowance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you come in here just to gloat? Is this your victory lap? Listen-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Johnny could even finish his complaint, Grace extended a bank card in his direction, her gesture calm and unhurried.</p>
