                <p>As soon as the attendant spoke, shocked whispers and startled gasps rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All color drained from Sonia&#39;s face. She leapt from her seat, jabbing her finger at the attendant and screaming, &#34;What are you talking about? I&#39;ve never even seen you before! How could I possibly be involved in something like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, regret flooded her-she wished more than anything she could undo her choices. Everything had seemed airtight in her mind. The truth was, Grace had never actually wronged her; she simply couldn&#39;t stomach Grace&#39;s cool indifference. Worse yet, Grace&#39;s striking looks had effortlessly eclipsed her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia had always reveled in being the one everyone watched. Ever since Grace arrived, though, the eyes that used to follow her had slowly gravitated toward Grace instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna had told her that Grace was nothing but an orphan. Fueled by envy, she plotted to embarrass Grace publicly-determined to wipe that quiet pride from her face forever. However, things hadn&#39;t gone according to plan. Now, she was the one tangled in her own trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands shaking, the attendant fished out a bank card and passed it to the police, stammering, &#34;This... this is what Miss Richardson gave me. You can see the transfer details for yourself...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accepting the card, the officer shǒt Sonia a hard,unforgiving look before addressing Grace. &#34;Miss Miller,it appears this was a set-up against you. We&#39;ll get to the bottom of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up as Sonia shook her head wildly, panic in her voice. &#34;No, you&#39;ve got it all wrong! Someone is framing me! Grace Miller-this is your doing, isn&#39;t it?You set me up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace merely regarded her with a calm, distant look,a faint, amused smile tugging at her lips. She saw no need to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown etched itself onto Chris&#39;s face as disappointment clouded his gaze. &#34;That&#39;s enough,Sonia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears brimming in her reddened eyes, Sonia grabbed onto his sleeve, desperation cracking her voice. &#34;Chris,you have to trust me-I swear I didn&#39;t do any of this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking free from her grip,he met her plea with a cold glare. &#34;You&#39;re still denying it, even with all the evidence laid out? Is this really how your family raised you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the officers stepped forward, voice sharp and unwavering. &#34;Miss Richardson, you&#39;ll need to cooperate with the investigation. Know that making false accusations comes with legal consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Sonia&#39;s cheeks as true panic set in.Scrambling, she pulled out her phone, voice shaking. &#34;I -I need to call my dad!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, amused laugh escaped Grace as she turned to the officers. &#34;I trust you&#39;ll handle this fairly. I have other matters to attend to, so l&#39;ll be on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance back, she walked out,every step calm and unhurried. Lingering any longer in that suffocating room had no appeal for her. She also suspected this ordeal would finally teach Sonia a lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Gianna watched the entire disaster play out, her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles turned white. She never imagined Grace would emerge from this completely untouched. How did things end up like this? Everything was supposed to go according to plan.Where had it all gone so wrong? Nothing about this outcome made sense to her. What were the odds that everything would line up this way? And how did Grace manage to keep her composure through it all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi, lost in the crowd, found herself just as baffled.She&#39;d hoped for the perfect opening to add her own twist to the drama, but the moment never arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rarely did she get invitations to gatherings like these,so she hadn&#39;t known the backstory or dynamics. When she witnessed everyone turning against Grace, a wave of relief had washed over her. However, luck was on Grace&#39;s side today-she slipped away from the chaos untouched. That outcome was nothing short of maddening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Grace made her exit, Gianna wasted no time leaving the venue herself. She couldn&#39;t shake the worry that Grace might mention something at home and stir up more trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Grace walked through the door than Julia appeared, concern in her eyes.&#34;Grace, how did everything go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything&#39;s fine,&#34; Grace answered, sidestepping any hint of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s smile returned. &#34;Wonderful. I&#39;ll make sure you get invited to more events like these-maybe you&#39;ll find some new friends along the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was at a loss for words, realizing too late that she&#39;d landed in an awkward situation. It was too late to express her dislike for these gatherings; everyone always seemed so hypocritical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Gianna saw that Grace hadn&#39;t mentioned what happened earlier, a wave of relief washed over her. The last thing she needed was for Rodger and Julia to discover Grace had been set up-and that she had stood by and done nothing One afternoon after classes ended, Grace rang home to say she&#39;d be missing dinner, then flagged down a taxi headed for Ambrosia Dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Known for its refined setting and tasteful decor,Ambrosia Dining stood out among the city&#39;s most exclusive spots. Set in a prime part of town, the restaurant always drew admiring glances. Affluent people filled the tables each evening, all savoring the air of quiet luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On this particular day, Patrick had arranged to meet Grace there for a conversation. She&#39;d come prepared-not just for a talk, but with manuscripts and some of her newest pills to hand over to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out from the car, Grace made her way through the entrance and into the softly lit lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick was already waiting, settled in one of the private dining rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, someone called out in surprise, &#34;Grace, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fant crease appeared on Grace&#39;s brow as she turned and spotted the entire Miller family nearby. Their formal attire suggested they were here for an important dinner engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace could only marvel at the coincidence. Was the city really so small that their paths kept crossing?Every time, she wished for space, and every time, fate had other plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding conversation was her goal, but Demi had no intention of letting her slip by.&#34;What&#39;s the matter? Lost your voice all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cool look slid Demi&#39;s way. &#34;Unless you own this place, I don&#39;t see why I&#39;d need your permission to eat here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint scowl tugged at lvy&#39;s lips. &#34;You do realize a meal at this place will set you back at least ten grand?Are you even aware of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disdain practically dripped from her words.</p>
