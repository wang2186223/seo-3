                <p>At first, the Miller family had believed Grace&#39;s life would improve once the Holden family took her in.However, since there had been no public announcement about the Holden family&#39;s adoption,coupled with the fact that Grace always seemed to be alone and rarely appeared with her new family,they concluded that she probably did not hold much importance in the household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her now, dressed so plainly, Demi even thought Grace had been kicked out of the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi curled her lips into a sneer. &#34;Grace, did youI come here for a job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a shame you never pursued writing. You&#39;ve got quite the flair for fiction,&#34; Grace shot back dryly, jibing Demi&#39;s delusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lvy joined in with a smirk.&#34;Wow, Grace. Things must really be going downhill for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still hadn&#39;t let go of the $200, 000 that Grace had cost them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t bother arguing. She brushed past them without so much as a sideways glance, walking toward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the private dining rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silent treatment only made Demi more eager to provoke her. She raised her voice, loud enough for others to hear.&#34;Oh no, did the Holden family abandon you? Now, you&#39;re working as a waitress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lvy added mock pity to her voice, sighing loudly.&#34;Grace, if you truly need money, just ask. If you can&#39;t manage on your own and starve yourself, it reflects badly on all of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luke said nothing, but his brows knitted slightly, a flicker of contempt flashing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the concern, but I&#39;m doing just fine. Still, I suggest y/ou savor your meal today. You might not get to eat here again,&#34; Grace said with a knowing tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean? Are you cursing us now? We won&#39;t be broke!&#34; lvy snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of his company&#39;s recent setbacks made Luke&#39;s frown deepen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the tension could rise further, the manager of the restaurant hurried over. He bent slightly at the waist and addressed Grace with utmost respect. &#34;Miss Miller, Mr. Brown is waiting for you in the VIP room.Shall I take you there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone from the Miller family froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The VIP room? It was typically reserved for the most prestigious guests. People even they couldn&#39;t easily rub shoulders with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Wait-what? You must be mistaken I can&#39;t believe this. She...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the manager remained composed, his tone unwavering. &#34;There&#39;s no mistake. Miss Miller is one of our honored guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shot the family a calm, level look. &#34;No need to escort me. I know the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned and walked off, every step confident and unhurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Demi stamped her heel. &#34;What the hell? How did she get into the VIP room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivy leaned in and whispered darkly to Luke, &#34;She&#39;s definitely clinging to someone with power.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way the Holden family would place this much importance on a girl they adopted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luke&#39;s expression turned thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the VIP room, Grace opened the door to find Patrick lounging by the window, swirling a glass of wine. Spotting her, he gave a crooked smile. &#34;You&#39;re late. Did something come up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rarely ran behind schedule. Something must&#39;ve delayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace set down a folder and a small.pill bottle on the table. Her voice was steady. &#34;Just ran into the Millers.They&#39;re annoying, but harmless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick chuckled and poured another glass for her.&#34;Guess those fools still haven&#39;t learned their place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace lifted the glass, her eyes glinting with frost.&#34;Eventually, they&#39;ll realize there are people you just don&#39;t mess with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick leaned forward, intrigued.&#34;Want me to step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a quick shake of her head.&#34;No thanks.I&#39;ve got it under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back with a shrug.&#34;Suit yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up the small bottle from the table, he turned it over in his hand, visibly unimpressed. &#34;Just one?Seriously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s not enough, hand it back. I&#39;ve got school to deal with. I don&#39;t exactly have spare time.&#34; Grace leaned into her chair, unconcerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still go to school? Isn&#39;t that a total waste for someone like you?&#34; Patrick blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shot him a look and rolled her eyes. &#34;You clearly don&#39;t get it. I have to go. I&#39;m not about to disappoint my parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick chuckled. &#34;Fair enough. Anyway, remember the Pearson family I mentioned? Guess what. They raised their consultation price to a billion. You heard that right -one billion! So... what do you think? Are you in?&#34;Patrick was so thrilled he could barely string a sentence together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace took a slow sip of her wine, her tone unreadable.&#34;A billion, huh? They must be really desperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick was practically bouncing in his seat. &#34;Exactly!The head of the Pearson family&#39;s illness is so bizarre even the Master Healer gave up. Word is, only Dr. Q stands a chance at treating him. That&#39;s why they&#39;re willing to pay a fortune to get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Pearson family&#39;s head? Grace&#39;s mind drifted.Could it be the same man she rescued a few days ago?He was a Pearson. The toxin in his system was exceptionally rare, making it no surprise that Kevin had failed to treat it. Her fingers circled the rim of her glass as she mulled it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her zoning out, Patrick waved a hand in front of her face. &#34;So? Are you taking it? It&#39;s a billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace blinked and came back to the moment, the corners of her mouth lifting. &#34;Sure. Why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Kevin, her own protégé, have his reputation ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick lit up like a firecracker. &#34;Awesome! I&#39;ll reach out to the Pearsons immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. I&#39;ll figure out a time that works,&#34; Grace replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect,&#34; Patrick said with a grin.</p>
