                <p>The ruckus quickly drew the attention of several students passing by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, Beatrice, and Johnny were all well-known figures at school, often the center of attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the three of them now in a confrontation, it instantly became the subject of gossip, with students whispering and speculating about what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|I swear I didn&#39;t slander her, Johnny. Don&#39;t you trust me?&#34; Beatrice cried, tears streaming down her face,unfazed by the growing audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been in the limelight and thrived on attention. Being ignored was far more unsettling for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she hadn&#39;t anticipated was that Grace wouldn&#39;t follow the usual script. Beatrice had already delivered two slaps to herself, only to receive two more from Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk about a streak of bad luck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made her blood boil even more was the fact that Johnny didn&#39;t slap Grace back, nor did he call her out in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t cry. I believe you,&#34; Johnny said, trying to juggle his own frustration and confusion while attempting to soothe Beatrice. &#34;There are too many eyes on us right now. Let&#39;s talk somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he gently took her hand and led her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that the main characters had left, the crowd of gossiping students quickly lost interest and began to scatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Gianna, who had been lurking quietly in a corner, and Lizzie, her ever-devoted sidekick,remained, unable to contain their buzz of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like Grace is making enemies left and right.Even Beatrice can&#39;t stand her,&#34; Lizzie commented with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, nearly everyone in their grade knew that Beatrice&#39;s confident strut around campus was all thanks to Johnny&#39;s support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without his backing, considering her family background, she would probably still be on the same level as Grace, who came from an orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought stirred resentment and envy in Lizzie.She couldn&#39;t understand what Johnny saw in Beatrice. She was also attractive and came from a far more prestigious family, so why hadn&#39;t he ever noticed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,this actually works in our favor. Like they say,the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&#34; Gianna said,clearly pleased by the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you getting at?&#34; Lizzie asked, curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m saying we are going to make a new friend,&#34;Gianna replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet, deserted hallway, Johnny was gently trying to soothe Beatrice. &#34;Don&#39;t cry, Beatrice. I know you have been wronged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He softly pressed an ice pack to her cheek while speaking in a soothing tone. &#34;When I get home tonight, I&#39;ll make sure she pays for this. I&#39;ll ask my mom to cut off her allowance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? But isn&#39;t your mom super fond of her?&#34;Beatrice asked, still doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No matter how much my mom likes her, she is still adopted. Do you think she means more than me, her own son?&#34; Johnny said with smug confidence.&#34;I&#39;ll have my mom transfer all of Grace&#39;s allowance to me. She is only attending this school because my dad donated a lab building. Now that she is stirring up trouble, my mom will teach her a lesson. Our family is all about discipline over spoiling.&#34; Once I get the money, I&#39;ll buy you those new designer shoes.And didn&#39;t you say you have been eyeing those international-brand skincare products? I&#39;ll buy them for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny understood that Beatrice wasn&#39;t difficult to please. She loved shopping and being spoiled with gifts, so he figured he would just have to tighten his budget a bit to keep her happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s eyes lit up at first, but she quickly composed herself and shook her head. &#34;I don&#39;t want that. You have already gotten me so many things lately. It&#39;s more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as you&#39;re happy, I can handle it,&#34; Johnny said sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, seriously. Just spending time with you, eating together, studying, and going shopping once in a while is all I need,&#34; Beatrice replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every girl enjoys shopping. I can&#39;t let you feel less special than anyone else,&#34; Johnny said instinctively.Deep down, he sensed that if he didn&#39;t treat her with gifts, he would have to work harder to keep her content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was still green and hadn&#39;t given it much thought, he assumed all girls were probably like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then... Thank you, Johnny. You&#39;re the best person in the world to me.&#34; Beatrice finally managed to smile through her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she hadn&#39;t managed to see Grace get punished on the spot, being pampered wvith luxury gifts from Johnny made for a satisfying consolation prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finally calming her down, Johnny hurried off,called away by a teacher who needed him for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he disappeared from view, Beatrice dropped her act. She lazily scrolled through her phone, replying to a few messages from admirers and tossing in a bit of harmless flirting before rising slowly and making her way back toward class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second she rounded the corner, she came face-to-face with someone unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; Gianna greeted her first, her tone unusually.friendly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice blinked, caught off guard. Gianna had always carried herself with an air of superiority and had never bothered to speak to her directly. What was she doing here now, initiating a conversation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you come looking for me?&#34; Beatrice immediately suspected that this wasn&#39;t a random encounter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I wanted to talk to you about something,&#34;Gianna replied smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this about Grace?&#34; Beatrice wasn&#39;t naive. In fact,she was quite sharp, and she immediately saw through Gianna&#39;s purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Beatrice and Gianna were attractive and well-known at school. While Beatrice didn&#39;t quite measure up to Gianna in terms of status, the two had mostly kept their distance from one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But ever since Grace had transferred in, she had managed to steal their spotlight without even trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice was convinced Gianna resented Grace just as much as she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. I enjoy working with smart people,&#34;Gianna said, nodding with a hint of approval.&#34;Then what do you want? Beatrice asked, arching an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s simple; I&#39;m suggesting we work together. From this moment on, we could be friends,&#34; Gianna replied.</p>
