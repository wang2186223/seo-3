                <p>Grace and Ella led the way, while the Millers followed close behind. Their faces put on a show of worry, but their eyes glimmered with a mean sort of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparkled within them. They were eager to witness just what kind of home would take Grace in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their minds, they pictured some struggling family,likely wanting an extra pair of hands for household chores.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, all assumptions vanished the moment their attention shifted to the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A white car,paint dulled by time and emblazoned with the logo of a car rental company, waited along the curb. Next to it stood a tall man whose presence seemed to fill the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hair looked tousled by the wind. Dust smudged his elegant silk shirt, but a commanding energy clung to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of recognition stirred in Grace&#39;s gaze. It took only a second to identify that shirt as something custom-tailored-a single garment that could have fed the Miller family for months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she looked away, her mind spun with quiet certainty. Whoever he was, this man was anything but ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rodger Holden studied Grace for a moment, his gaze sharp. A flicker of surprise crossed his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had imagined he would find a timid, anxious girl,but the young woman standing before him held her ground, calm and collected, meeting the moment without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Known as the driving force behind the Holden Group,Rodger&#39;s reputation stretched across the business world-a man far out of reach for people like the Millers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His marriage to Julia was strong, and together they had raised two sons. Still, Julia longed for a daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half a year ago, Julia had met Grace at the orphanage and immediately felt a connection, but at that time,Grace had already been taken in by another family.Julia never truly let go of the hope that one day things might be different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Ella called earlier today with unexpected news, Julia&#39;s happiness spilled over-she wept for joy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and sent Rodger to fetch Grace without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving behind a deal worth a fortune, Rodger dashed across town. On his way, fate tossed in a mishap;his car ended up wrecked, though he walked away without a scratch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurriedly found a rental and sped toward the Miller family&#39;s home, setting the stage for the meeting that now unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by Rodger&#39;s unremarkable clothes and the battered rental car, the Millers&#39; sneers grew more obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their expectations had already been low for Grace&#39;s new family, but the reality appeared even more disappointing. The man&#39;s dirty shirt and the sight of the rental car only fueled that impression. It looked as though Grace&#39;s prospects were nothing but gloomy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching it all unfold, Demi allowed herself a quiet,satisfied grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was simple: she basked in her parents &#39;affection, the family&#39;s beloved daughter. As for Grace? Life ahead looked grim, and she seemed fated for a rough road with people barely scraping by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella could not hide her surprise. Something felt off about this situation. As far as she remembered, Julia</p>
                
                
                
                <p>came from a wealthy background, and every time they met, Julia showed nothing but generosity. She suspected there had to be a mistake somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer with Grace, her voice polite as she said, &#34;Nice to meet you, Mr. Holden. I&#39;d like you to meet Grace Miller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rodger took a careful look at Grace,his good impression of her grew stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all made sense-why Julia had never stopped thinking about this girl. Sometimes, it came down to a feeling that couldn&#39;t be explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sure of it: their family and Grace belonged together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle nod, he replied, &#34;Yes, I remember. My wife told me all about her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella let out a soft breath, relief settling in as she offered Grace a gentle pat on the shoulder. &#34;Grace,meet Mr. Rodger Holden. He&#39;s Julia&#39;s husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace acknowledged the introduction,her eyes taking in Rodger&#39;s sharp looks and calm confidence. He wore a stern expression, but she sensed a quiet kindness underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For reasons she couldn&#39;t name,she had a favorable feeling about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, there were others who felt differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s mouth twitched as she put on a look of innocence and stepped forward. &#34;Grace, did he arrive in a rental car? Should I have my dad loan you one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She batted her lashes, and her sweet tone did nothing to hide the teasing glint in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace turned away, not sparing her a second glance.&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. Rental cars are perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luke let out an exaggerated sigh. &#34;When you settle into your new home, try to be on your best behavior.Since your grades aren&#39;t impressive, at least make sure you don&#39;t make any trouble.&#34; His tone put Grace down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s eyes met Luke&#39;s with a chilling steadiness,and his words cut through the air. &#34;Academic performance isn&#39;t a concern for us. What matters is that my daughter lives a joyful life. We can afford to give her everything she needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Miller family exchanged uneasy glances. They couldn&#39;t help but bristle at his boldness. While they weren&#39;t poor themselves, none of them would have dared to speak so boldly. How dare this man bluff before them? Wearing plain clothes and arriving in a rental car, who exactly was he trying to impress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi, on the other hand, felt a secret thrill, thinking Grace would soon be left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the air rumbled as the sound of engines approached. Three sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantoms pulled up behind Rodger,coming to a sharp halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, the doors swung open and a group of sharply dressed bodyguards stepped out. Their voices rang out clearly. &#34;Sir, Mrs. Holden sent us to bring you and Miss Grace Miller home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, the Miller family stood rooted to the spot,their faces drained of color. Rolls-Royce cars?Uniformed bodyguards?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi stared at Rodger, eyes growing wide. Wait...Could this Rodger Holden be the same person who headed the influential Holden Group?</p>
