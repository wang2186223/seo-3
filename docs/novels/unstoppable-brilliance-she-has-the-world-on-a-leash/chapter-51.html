                <p>Anger flared brightly across Beatrice&#39;s features before quickly giving way to a pale shock; she clenched her fists so tightly her nails bit sharply into her palms. How could she have possibly guessed that the handbag Grace casually held had come straight from Johnny&#39;s mother? What did his mom see in Grace that made her so generous toward her? Even more generous than with her own son?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Chloe shifted uncomfortably, silently pleading to evaporate from the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In mere moments, everything had spiraled wildly out of control, leaving everyone baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Beatrice&#39;s ghostly expression, Johnny shot Grace a heated glare before gently saying, &#34;Beatrice,don&#39;t mind Grace. She clearly doesn&#39;t recognize quality when she sees it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet as soon as those words escaped his lips, regret nipped at him. The jab felt petty-who truly misunderstood the situation here? Who was actually blind to a rare treasure right before them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Grace smiled softly and walked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>away with Adrianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration surged through Beatrice,who slammed her foot against the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long afterward, everyone drifted toward the basketball court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long-awaited faceoff between Briskvale High and their rival school had finally arrived. Students packed thesidelines, their voices rising in support of their team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be long before Johnny, one of the school&#39;s own, took his place in the game, ready to represent them on the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excited cheers echoed among the gathered students,each voice filled with pride for their school&#39;s reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anticipation rippled through the crowd, and they eagerly awaited the game&#39;s start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both sides bringing equal strength to the field,neither team could expect an easy victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front of the crowd, Beatrice held her pom-poms high, her cheerful smile once again lighting up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called out warmly, waving with enthusiasm,&#34;Johnny, you&#39;ve got this! Victory is ours for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny responded with a quick nod but found his attention drifting toward Grace, wondering what thoughts hid behind her quiet eyes. Did she even grasp the basic rules of basketball?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the whistle blew, Johnny dazzled the crowd, landing several outstanding layups to roaring applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team quickly pulled ahead by three points, and excitement rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,basketball required more than individual brilliance.Soon Johnny&#39;s stamina faltered, and their slim lead slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During a swift counterattack, Johnny desperately dodged a rival defender but crashed to the floor,wincing painfully as his ankle twisted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp echoed from the stands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice hesitated, readying herself to run forward,but paused when she saw Grace already at Johnny&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gently examined the injury and calmly explained,&#34;Your ankle&#39;s sprained. You need ice immediately or it&#39;ll swell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat dripping from his brow, Johnny stubbornly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pushed her hand aside. &#34;I don&#39;t need your help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s brows furrowed slightly, her voice steady.&#34;Moving around now will only worsen it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A teammate quickly chimed in, &#34;Johnny,she&#39;s right.Let&#39;s handle this properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Efficiently, Grace provided basic first aid, expertly stabilizing Johnny&#39;s ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, another problem quickly arose. With Johnny sidelined, who could possibly step up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they supposed to just accept defeat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny limped to the bench while the coach,worried and uncertain, scanned the substitutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing their star point guard was disastrous, as the skill gap was enormous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then suddenly Grace spoke,her voice surprisingly calm.&#34;Coach,put me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basketball wasn&#39;t exactly rocket science.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching their struggle from the sidelines had already exhausted her patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunned silence briefly overtook the crowd before laughter erupted everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice sneered, &#34;Grace, have you lost it? This isn&#39;t some childish game! What can you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surely, in a school this large, there has to be at least one person who fits the role perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiously, the coach eyed Grace. &#34;Do you even play basketball?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace casually glanced at the court and answered,&#34;Is it supposed to be hard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she strode confidently onto the court and picked up an abandoned basketball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mocking eyes watched as she effortlessly tossed the ball upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ball curved beautifully, dropping perfectly through the hoop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An astonished quiet spread rapidly through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace calmly turned back to the coach. &#34;Can I join now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the coach could speak, the referee sharply blew his whistle and announced, &#34;Substitution approved.Resume play!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice paled once more, her nails nearly piercing her skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t fathom that Grace genuinely knew how to play, and rather impressively, it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She only made that shot by sheer luck,&#34; Beatrice shouted to the others nearby. &#34;Just wait until she&#39;s actually out there, and she&#39;s going to make a complete fool of herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the game picked back up and the players noticed that Briskvale High had put a girl on the court,they exchanged amused grins, clearly not taking her seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Briskvale? Is this your idea of comnpetition?&#34;mocked their point guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace simply regarded him coldly, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whistle sounded,resuming play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Underestimating Grace severely, their opponents paid her no mind, until she swiftly maneuvered past their lax defense, elegantly scoring a flawless layup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whoa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She actually knows what she&#39;s doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That move was incredibole!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the remainder of the game, Grace dominated effortlessly. Her lightning speed, fluid</p>
                
                
                
                <p>dribbles, and precise passes opened easy scoring chances for teammates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More impressively, she drained multiple three-pointers from afar, decisively turning the tables in their favor.</p>
