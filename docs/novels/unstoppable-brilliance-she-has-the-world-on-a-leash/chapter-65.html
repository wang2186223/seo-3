                <p>Eliana, who had once firmly opposed Rodger&#39;s decision to adopt Grace, now found herself quietly humbled. That very orphan she despised had just saved her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The emotion welled up so suddenly, it left her momentarily speechless. She didn&#39;t quite know how to describe it. Gratitude? Regret? Both?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna,ever persistent, tried to downplay Grace&#39;s role.She kept insisting that it was Kevin who had pulled Eliana back from the brink of death. But Eliana wasn&#39;t naive. She could piece the truth together on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, if it hadn&#39;t been for Grace&#39;s sharp warning back then, she might never have realized how serious her illness truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her lips press together in hesitation.After a moment&#39;s pause, she finally looked at Grace and murmured,&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just two simple words-but coming from Eliana,who was naturally proud and rarely admitted fault, they carried immense weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna,upon hearing this, was stunned-and completely unwilling to accept it. Though her face remained composed, a storm of unease churned inside her.How swiftly had this wretched Grace managed to charm even Eliana? No, she wouldn&#39;t allow that.Absolutely not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a carefully measured tone, Gianna said, &#34;Aunt Eliana, I&#39;ve heard of a rare medicine called the Rejuvenation Pill. It&#39;s supposed to be very effective for your condition. There&#39;s an auction in a few days where it will be available, and Claire and I will do everything we can to get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna intentionally included Claire in her statement,subtly expressing her willingness while ensuring that Claire would be the one footing the bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire, oblivious to her scheming, quickly declared,&#34;Yes! I&#39;ve heard those pills are amazing for recovering from serious illnesses.&#34; If they could save her mother,she&#39;d stop at nothing to get them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, the Rejuvenation Pill is excellent for post-surgical recovery and can even help prevent the spread of tumor cells. Three pills eliminate the need for chemotherapy,&#34; Grace assured, a bit surprised that Gianna and Claire were aware of the drug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s wonderful news,&#34; Eliana responded, her will to survive intensifying. At the thought of escaping the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>torment of chemotherapy, her heart swelled with hope and gratitude toward Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew how brutal chemotherapy could be-the side effects alone were enough to break a person.The idea of bypassing that pain lit a fire of determination in Eliana&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the pill could truly spare her such suffering, then no price would be too high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect! Mom, I swear I&#39;ll get the Rejuvenation Pill for you on the day of the auction!&#34; Claire&#39;s eyes gleamed with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that glimmer of hope didn&#39;t last long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Rejuvenation Pill isn&#39;t easy to come by,&#34; Kevin interjected flatly. &#34;It&#39;s a rare treasure and highly sought after. There will only be two pills available at the auction-and Mrs. Robertson needs at least three.&#34;He almost rolled his eyes at Claire&#39;s naïve enthusiasm.Did she really think this miracle drug was as easy to get as a loaf of bread?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I didn&#39;t know that,&#34; Claire stammered, anxiety creeping into her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry for now,&#34; Rodger cut in, offering reassurance. &#34;When the time comes, take Grace with you to the auction. Forget the cost-just make sure you get those two pills.&#34; He had no grasp of the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>medical side of things, but if everyone said the medicine could help, then he would spare no expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When a family stood united, there was nothing they couldn&#39;t overcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Eliana&#39;s eyes as she lay on the sickbed.It was in moments like this-when life hung by a thread-that one truly saw who cared without condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Rodger&#39;s advice, Julia, who was gentle and devoted,continued to reassure Eliana, &#34;Yeah. Let&#39;s try our best to obtain those two pills. When the time comes, we&#39;ll figure out a means to get another one.There will definitely be a way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Carl-who had remained silent thus far-was growing more and more disgruntled. Why should their family&#39;s wealth be poured into saving Eliana? She had married into another family. Shouldn&#39;t her husband be footing the bill? Yet here they were,watching as Eliana&#39;s husband offered neither money nor help, while Eliana drained the Holden family&#39;s resources. She had even tried to come back to her mother&#39;s house to seize things for Claire when she thought she was dying.How shameless could one get?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Carl thought about it, the more bitter he felt-especially with his wife always muttering that Rodger and Eliana were set to take over the Holden</p>
                
                
                
                <p>family&#39;s properties, leaving him with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolving to take action, Carl decided to speak to Eliana&#39;s husband soon and demand he share in the financial burden for Eliana&#39;s care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the day of the auction arrived, Grace accompanied Gianna and Claire to the grandest and most exclusive auction house in town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This auction house belongs to the Pearson family,&#34;Gianna said, holding up a gold-edged invitation as though it were a trophy. &#34;Not just anyone can walk in -you need an official invitation.&#34; Her voice carried a deliberate air of pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Claire, Gianna was invited for the first time and was there to expand her horizons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she couldn&#39;t resist showing off in front of Grace as though she were a frequent visitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re correct. My mother made a lot of effort to receive two invitations. I can hardly bring you in, even though you don&#39;t have one,&#34; Claire said.</p>
