                <p>Claire felt a flicker of anxiety and a dip in confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had pulled every string she could, leveraging her connections to secure two invitations-meant originally for Claie and Grace. After all, one was her daughter, and the other was the doctor who had saved her life.Grace was expected to play a critical role in her upcoming treatment and recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Gianna? What exactly was her contribution?Though she had brought up the Rejuvenation Pill, she hadn&#39;t done anything meaningful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s original intention had been for Claire and Grace to attend together. However, a close friend of hers had offered a favor, mentioning that even without an official invitation, it was still possible to bring one extra person along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The downside was that anyone entering without an invitation would be seen as riding someone else&#39;s coattails-hardly a flattering position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire and Gianna shared a good relationship,and Claire couldn&#39;t bring herself to let Gianna be the one left out. Besides, Gianna had always carried herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with pride, and her ego would never tolerate being the tag-along guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, Grace was the one who ended up without an invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard everything, right? Even if you don&#39;t have an invitation, there&#39;s still a seat for you, so don&#39;t stress,&#34;Gianna said in mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Grace&#39;s lack of reaction, she assumed she was flustered. A sense of petty satisfaction swelled in her chest. Finally, a chance to get even-for the way Grace had outshone her at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Grace merely offered a dispassionate,&#34;If you&#39;re done talking, let&#39;s go.&#34; Then she strode calmly toward the auction entrance. These two were really overreacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this drama-was it truly worth it over something as trivial as an invitation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna began, ready to launch into another round of veiled jabs. But before she could finish, Grace brushed past her, retrieving a sleek black card encrusted with shimmering diamonds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member at the entrance immediately straightened. He received the card with both hands,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his posture turning deferential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are our most esteemed Supreme VIP client.Please proceed to the second-floor private room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second-floor private room?! Gianna and Claire froze in place, utterly stunned. Although it was their first time here, they knew well enough what the second-floor private rooms meant-they were reserved for the auction house&#39;s top-tier clientele, requiring a quarterly spend of over ten million to qualify. In terms of wealth and status, those who were allowed access to the private rooms were in a different league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The private rooms on the second floor were already extremely remarkable, with the exception of the greatest private room on the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above that, the only private room on the third floor was legendary-exclusively held for the head of the Pearson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace came in, and the two of them hurried after her.They had assumed Grace was tagging along under their privilege. Now it was clear-they were the ones riding hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so luxurious,&#34; Claire whispered in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder it was a room for a Supreme VIP.It wasn&#39;t particularly large, yet everything inside-every tile,every decorative piece-spoke of elegance and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive floor-to-ceiling glass window stood at the front, crafted from a special one-way material. They could see everything in the auction hall, while no one below could see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna and Claire, despite their polished upbringing in high society, now looked like wide-eyed villagers visiting the city for the first time, marveling at every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just being in that room made them feel like the most important people in the world. They began taking selfies for Instagram, each photo paired with a showy caption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,the auction officially began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna and Claire leaned forward, intrigued by the rare items presented-but neither dared place a bid. They needed to conserve every coin for the Rejuvenation Pill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, on the other hand, reclined in her seat,expression unreadable. Her thoughts were elsewhere.She was already considering whether she should lower the price of the Rejuvenation Pill herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, this was the Holden family&#39;s money, and Eliana&#39;s husband wasn&#39;t contributing a single dime.Grace had no desire to profit from her father&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s starting! The Rejuvenation Pill is up for auction!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna and Claire instantly perked up, visibly thrilled and ready for a heated bidding war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the starting price had been lowered to one hundred thousand per pill, it skyrocketed almost instantly-soaring to one million, then five million,and soon ten million-with no signs of slowing down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Holden family had allocated a budget of fifty million for this auction. But at this rate, even securing one pill seemed nearly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace hadn&#39;t expected the pills she crafted to attract such overwhelming demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it wasn&#39;t surprising. These rare, life-saving pills were a godsend for the sick--and a magnet for the rich.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If spending tens of millions could offer even the slimmest chance of outrunning death, then to these wealthy elites, it was money well spent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fifty million!&#34; Claire shouted through gritted teeth,her voice trembling with determination. She had to get at least one pill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then came a cool, clear voice from the third floor -elegant and poised. &#34;One hundred million dollars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hundred million for just one pill? It was madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna and Claire sat frozen, their minds reeling. At last, they felt the sheer intensity of the competition at these elite auctions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they were hopelessly outbid-completely out of their league.</p>
