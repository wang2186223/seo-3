            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still standing up for her? It&#39;s because you&#39;ve pampered her too much that she&#39;s become completely uncontrollable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel&#39;s face darkened, frustration igniting her heart condition once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her view, Grace&#39;s defiant streak was obvious. At this rate, with how much they were indulging her, it was only a matter of time before something truly disastrous happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again, she thought Rodger never should have married Julia, who always got on her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Beatrice watched with satisfaction gleaming in her eyes. Seeing Grace being put in her place was the kind of scene she relished. Her resentment toward Julia ran deep-if the Holdens had adopted her instead of that nobody,she would&#39;ve outshined Grace a thousand times over. &#34;Mom, don&#39;t say that. I actually think Grace is wonderful. Everyone shines in their own way,&#34; Eliana said brightly, her voice full of warmth as she openly took Grace&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Eliana had been completely won over by Grace made Gianna feel sick. But for now, she couldn&#39;t find an angle to stir up more trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, don&#39;t get too worked up. You haven&#39;t been feeling well lately. Try to focus on resting and keeping your spirits up,&#34; Gianna said sweetly.She knew exactly how to keep Ethel on her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice wasn&#39;t about to miss the moment either.Despite still being a student, she was a natural at social manipulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a graceful smile, she offered, &#34;Mrs. Holden, I heard from Gianna that you&#39;ve been having aches and pains lately. I know a little about massage-would you like me to help ease the tension?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That would be lovely. You&#39;re such a considerate girl,&#34; Ethel replied, her tone softening at once. If Gianna had brought her along, then surely this girl had been raised well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice stepped forward eagerly, her hands already in motion as she began to massage Ethel&#39;s shoulders. She carried herself with the poise of someone polished and attentive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men she had once entertained always raved about her massages-she&#39;d even taken professional lessons to perfect the technique. And now, alI that training was finally proving useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm... Not bad at all. You&#39;ve got just the right pressure, and you know exactly where to press. I&#39;m impressed,&#34; Ethel murmured, clearly enjoying the massage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Gianna jumped in smoothly, seizing the opportunity to take another dig. &#34;Massages, at worst,are harmless-unlike some people who insist on acting like doctors, performing surgeries, and recklessly selling meds. That&#39;s when things start getting dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present picked up on the veiled insult without needing names. Julia&#39;s face immediately turned grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, medicine isn&#39;t something to take lightly.Eliana, your brother should help you find a proper specialist for a second opinion,&#34; Ethel added sternly,her voice lined with distrust toward anyone outside the realm of officially recognized doctors-especially Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I only trust Grace. She understands my condition better than anyone. She&#39;s the only one I&#39;ll allow to treat me,&#34; Eliana declared, her tone firm and final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just about liking Grace. Eliana genuinely believed in her ability. And deep down, she remained deeply grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had been ready to speak up in Grace&#39;s defense,but before she could open her mouth, someone else jumped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Holden and Gianna do make a good point.Grace grew up in an orphanage-how much real education could she have possibly received? There&#39;s no way she understands advanced medical science.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Beatrice. Buoyed by the recent compliments from Ethel, she couldn&#39;t resist the urge to chime in.Spotting Ethel&#39;s clear dislike for Grace, she eagerly took the opportunity to lecture Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had never cared much for the girl to begin with.And now, hearing her openly demean Grace pushed her patience to the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to strike out when Grace gently pulled at her sleeve, telling her to wait. Grace then gently raised her voice. &#34;Beatrice, I doubt your own family background is anything to boast about.&#34; Her tone was light, lips curved in a half-smile, but the steel in her voice was impossible to miss. &#34;A gambling father,a sickly mother, and a little brother still in primary school... If we&#39;re laying everything bare, your situation&#39;s hardly an upgrade. You&#39;re only here thanks to my dear brother&#39;s generosity-he&#39;s been paying your tuition and living costs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a quiet satisfaction in standing her ground. That was why Grace had stopped Julia-she preferred to fight her own battles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed with force. Beatrice&#39;s face turned crimson, her eyes darting as she scrambled for a response but found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel, who had been watching from the sidelines,suddenly took a second look. Just moments ago,she had found Beatrice charming-elegant, well-groomed, decked out in luxury brands. She had assumed the girl came from a respectable,well-off family. But now? A troubled background? A charity case funded by her grandson? Ethel&#39;s eyes grew cold, tainted with the same contempt she felt for people lower in society. There was no doubt that people in her society were categorized into ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait... Johnny&#39;s been paying her bills?&#34; Julia&#39;s eyes widened, disbelief flashing across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been strict with her son, tightly managing his allowance-nothing like the leniency she extended to Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, even with so little at his disposal, he had still managed to support Beatrice? That could only mean one thing-he&#39;d been saving and sacrificing just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy feeling settled in Julia&#39;s chest. Was her son truly growing attached to this girl? She didn&#39;t likethat thought one bit!</p>
