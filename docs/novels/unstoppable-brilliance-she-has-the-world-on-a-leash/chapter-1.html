                <p>&#34;Grace, now that my parents have finally brought me home,do you actually believe there&#39;s still room for you here? The truth is, there&#39;s no space for you in this family.&#34; Demi Miller&#39;s mouth twisted into a sly grin as she leaned closer and spoke in a low, menacing tone beside the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished, she suddenly toppled backward into the sparkling water, sending up a flurry of splashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos broke loose as she flailed her arms and kicked wildly, as if she were on the verge of drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody help! I can&#39;t get out!&#34; Her screams rang out,her voice full of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the pool, Grace Miller stood quietly, her expression as cold as stone. There was not a flicker of warmth or concern in her eyes as she watched Demi&#39;s frantic struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked the grand homecoming celebration that Luke and Ivy Miller had thrown for their long-lost daughter,Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighteen years had slipped by since the day Demi</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that Luke and Ivy Miller had thrown for their long-lost daughter,Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eighteen years had slipped by since the day Demi vanished at birth. Even after endless searching, the couple had found nothing. Later, they adopted Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could have guessed that Demi would resurface as an adult, suddenly making Grace&#39;s place in the family seem unnecessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Demi!&#34; lvy yelled from inside the villa. She burst outside,Luke close behind, panic etched on both their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp, accusing stare, lvy&#39;s gaze bounced between her daughter thrashing in the water and Grace, who stood at the edge. &#34;Grace! How could you?Why would you shove Demi into the pool?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luke didn&#39;t hesitate. He leaped into the pool,leaving Ivy jabbing her finger at Grace. &#34;Leave this house! You don&#39;t belong here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t lay a hand on her,&#34; Grace replied with a calm indifference, her voice steady and almost detached.&#34;Demi jumped in all by herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lie!&#34; lvy&#39;s voice shook with anger.&#34;Why would she jump in herself? We opened our home to you, and this is how you repay our kindness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Luke had managed to lift Demi out of the pool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soaked and trembling in her father&#39;s arms, Demi blinked away tears and murmured, &#34;Please don&#39;t blame Grace. This happened because of me. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have come home at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like a fragile bird caught in a storm,shivering slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With deep affection, lvy pulled Demi close and whispered, &#34;Demi, your kindness never fails to touch me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone sharpened as she faced Grace. &#34;Go pack your belongings and leave this house right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet uncertainty flickered across Luke&#39;s face. He dropped his voice and tried to reason. &#34;When we took Grace in, we made a promise to the orphanage director to treat her well. Maybe there&#39;s some misunderstanding...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping before he could finish, lvy retorted, &#34;What is there to misunderstand? It was our own daughter who nearly drowned. No one was around! Are you honestly saying Grace had nothing to do with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no argument, Luke let out a defeated sigh.He nodded and gave in. &#34;Alright, we&#39;ll arrange for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he dialed Ella Fowler, the woman who ran the orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their decision to adopt Grace came at a time when they needed it most. Thanks to the adoption, they received financial support of three hundred thousand dollars, which arrived just in time to save them from hardship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Demi&#39;s reappearance, Grace no longer fit into the family&#39;s plans. Perhaps it was best for everyone if she was sent away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace watched the scene from a distance, her expression cool and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tall and elegant, she stood apart, her face stunning but aloof. Yet, not a flicker of pain or resentment shone in her gaze-there was only a strange,unshakable peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Luke fidgeted awkwardly. &#34;Grace,Ms. Fowler will be here soon. Take everything we bought for you-and here&#39;s a grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want it,&#34; Grace interrupted flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled in Ivy&#39;s arms, Demi&#39;s eyes sparkled with satisfaction. In a tone laced with innocence, she chimed in, &#34;Grace, do you still feel bad that I&#39;ve come</p>
                
                
                
                <p>home? All I want is to be close to my parents and be the daughter they deserve...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You poor thing, it&#39;s Grace who owes you an apology.She&#39;s the one who took your spot all these years,&#34; lvy said,her voice full of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace cast a steady, unreadable look at both lvy and Luke. &#34;You both know the truth. I never laid a hand on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces tightened at her accusation, but blood ties always took precedence. It was clear which side they would choose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing left to discuss. What&#39;s done is done,&#34;Luke replied, frowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ready to lash out, lvy barely had time to speak before voices echoed from the front of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged woman crossed into view, speaking with careful respect. &#34;Mr. Miller, I&#39;ve comne to take Grace with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The statement caught Luke off guard for a second. He managed a nod. &#34;Go on, Grace. Ms. Fowler will take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making her way to Grace, Ella&#39;s eyes brimmed with warmth. &#34;Come, sweetheart. None of this is your fault,and I&#39;ll do everything I can to help you find a real</p>
                
                
                
                <p>home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With gentle encouragement, she reached for Grace&#39;s hand. &#34;Do you remember Julia Holden from your last visit to the orphanage? She&#39;s very fond of you. After hearing about what happened, she wants you to join her family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small flicker of emotion crossed Grace&#39;s eyes.Wasn&#39;t Julia the one who always wore a kind smile?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kindness radiated from Ella as she continued, &#34;Julia&#39;s family is already on their way. If you want, you can start fresh with her family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing, she added with quiet hope, &#34;I believe you&#39;ll fit in much better there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only four more chances remained for Ella to help Grace find a place where she belonged. This was the last hope she could offer. If this didn&#39;t work out...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, Grace stood quietly. Then, with a nod, she replied, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief spread across Ella&#39;s face, her smile gentle and sincere.</p>
