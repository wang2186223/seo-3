                <p>At the office, Anthony Baldwin, the dean of Briskvale High, slid his glasses higher, eyes narrowed as he scanned the file in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s academic file told a familiar story-three transfers and unimpressive marks across the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the admissions director&#39;s reminder echoed in his mind. Rodger Holden had contributed an entire building to the school. That kind of generosity made many things easier to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using the desk phone, Anthony called out, &#34;Ms. Dixon,could you stop by my office for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for the door to swing open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie Dixon entered, her dark-rimmed glasses perched high and her chin held higher. &#34;Mr. Baldwin, is this really so urgent? My honors students are in the middle of a major group project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a history of sending students to the top of the SAT rankings, and she knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A string of successes had built her reputation, and she wore it like a badge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to maintain a neutral tone, Anthony met her gaze. &#34;There&#39;ll be a new face in your classroom today -Grace Miller.&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me? You mean a transfer?&#34; Ellie&#39;s skeptical gaze flicked toward Grace, who waited silently by the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace lowered her gaze,long bangs falling forward to shield her features, an unmistakable awkwardness hanging around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much hesitation, Ellie decided Grace fit the profile of a struggling student-she had seen plenty who never managed to improve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t be serious, Mr. Baldwin! The semester&#39;s well underway, and you&#39;re telling me we have a new transfer?&#34; Ellie&#39;s voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was understandable that the protest was so sharp-transfers were unheard of at Briskvale High, a school famous for its strict policies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony let out a weary sigh. &#34;These are her academic records. Does this look like a joke to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Ellie flipped through the papers, and a wave of disbelief left her momentarily unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a single mark for Math, English, or Science?&#34;Ellie&#39;s voice sliced through the air, her hand trembling as she jabbed at the transcript. &#34;You&#39;re telling me she failed every core subject? Why would you even consider putting her in the honors class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood in the room shifted, tension thickening the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony cleared his throat, keeping his voice low and careful. &#34;Ms. Dixon, perhaps you could be a bit more considerate...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t help that Grace stood right there-his words did little to soften the blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping the folder closed, Ellie glared at him,her eyes hard behind her glasses. &#34;This is the top class in the school, Mr. Baldwin! Every student here has lvy League dreams. How is she supposed to keep up with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stayed quiet, head lowered and lashes casting faint shadows across her cheeks, the picture of shy resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one noticed the hint of a smirk that flickered and vanished on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Dixon, that&#39;s enough.&#34; Anthony&#39;s voice grew firm as he pulled out a sealed document and slid it across</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the desk. &#34;The school board has already decided.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single glance at the paper, with the principal&#39;s bold seal,drained all color from Ellie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t ready to give in just yet. &#34;Even top-tier teachers struggle with students who have this record.At least let her prove herself with a placement test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, Ellie snatched up a science test paper from the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here-see what you can do with this.&#34; She hoped the difficulty would discourage Grace from staying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie would rather see the girl bow out now than face certain embarrassment in front of the entire class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony hesitated, then finally gave a resigned nod.&#34;Grace Miller,take a seat and begin when you&#39;re ready.&#34;He knew the exam was notoriously tough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Science had always been Ellie&#39;s specialty-she&#39;d chosen the hardest paper for this little test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into a chair, Grace picked up her pen and started the exam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot nearby, Ellie watched closely,ready to witness Grace stumble and embarrass herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her head down, Grace moved her pen across</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the page, her hand flying as if the questions were routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie stood nearby, arms folded and a smirk on her face, certain the test would overwhelm even her brightest students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone&#39;s shock, Grace rose from her seat in under fifteen minutes. &#34;I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony and Ellie stared at her in disbelief. That was impossibly fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony felt a quiet sigh form inside him. Maybe her troubles weren&#39;t just poor grades-maybe she truly lacked focus. A trace of disappointment crept over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie let out a mocking laugh. Speed meant nothing if the answers were nonsense. Clearly, Grace had just filled the sheet to look impressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Ellie snatched up the test and gave it a quick scan,blinking in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every question had an answer. Her skepticism only deepened. Surely, Grace didn&#39;t believe that simply answering everything would make her stand out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her pen, Ellie began marking, the pen&#39;s scratch filling the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as the answer key matched up line after line,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie&#39;s face darkened-Grace hadn&#39;t missed a single question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing up, Ellie&#39;s voice went cold. &#34;She completed this science exam in under fifteen minutes. Every answer is correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anthony stood rooted to the spot,completely floored.Could Grace actually be gifted? He&#39;d never witnessed anyone breeze through a placement test without a single mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bitter edge, Ellie said with a scoff, &#34;It&#39;s hard to believe, Mr. Baldwin. Such hard questions done this fast? Forget her transcript, this is clearly a case of cheating. I won&#39;t sit back and welcome a student who plays us for fools.&#34;</p>
