                <p>&#34;Is that what I think it is?&#34; One guest&#39;s eyes widened as she blurted out, &#34;Is that made of Hipolis agarwood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hipolis agarwood? Are you serious?&#34; People started whispering in disbelief, then their voices rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People leaned in, drawn by a scent that seemed to wrap the whole room in its embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in closer, Grace explained in a gentle tone,&#34;This bracelet was made from agarwood in Hipolis, and rumor has it the wood is over three centuries old. The scent takes generations to mature, and these beads were crafted from the very best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weren&#39;t those bracelets made for royalty? Only three sets ever existed, if the stories are true! How could such a relic end up here? This is incredible. Money can&#39;t buy something like this,&#34; someone stammered,their voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wonder in that voice filled the room. Anyone who understood the legend knew that owning such a bracelet was beyond what wealth alone could bring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel&#39;s breath caught as the meaning behind the present sank in. Her hands trembled a little as she received the bracelet, noticing tiny, elegant inscriptions carved into every bead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion swept over her, and she breathed out, true. Memories flood back to me now; my father always longed for this treasure. He once told me, if only he could have this with him, he&#39;d leave this world without a single regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of excitement moved through the crowd, the atmosphere alive with wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s face turned pale, tension twisting through her fingers. The thought of Grace presenting such a priceless gift had never crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger and Julia were left speechless. The price alone was unimaginable, but its rarity made its appearance almost unbelievable. How in the world did Grace manage to acquire it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by curiosity, everyone in the room circled around, eager to take a closer look at each bead&#39;s flawless surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently turning the beads over in her palm, Ethel admired the subtle, golden warmth radiating from each one. Its value was impossible to put into words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed her gaze on Grace, eyes swirling with mixed feelings. &#34;How did you come across something sO rare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A peaceful smile played on Grace&#39;s lips. &#34;It all happened by chance. A treasure like this only finds meaning with someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel cradled the precious bracelet in her hands,handlingit with unmistakable reverence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the crowd began presenting their gifts,filling the air with laughter and music once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simmering beneath her poised exterior, Gianna could barely contain her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been so sure her own gift would steal the show. Her bank account had paid the price,all for this moment of recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Grace had managed to eclipse her effort completely. The truth was obvious-nothing could compare to the legendary bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation burned inside Gianna, impossible to ignore.Scanning the room, she caught Eliana&#39;s eyes fixed on her, an amused sparkle dancing in Eliana&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s breath caught in her chest. She quickly arranged her face into a smile. &#34;Aunt Eliana, is there something on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gliding closer with her glass, Eliana twirled her wine thoughtfully before lowering her voice. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Already letting jealousy get the better of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna pressed her hands together, feeling her fingernails bite into her palms.&#34;No,I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick glance from Eliana landed on Grace, now surrounded by admirers. &#34;Rumor has it Mrs. Pearson offered an outrageous sum for Hipolis agarwood and walked away empty-handed. Yet Grace managed to get her hands on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrewd light sparked in Gianna&#39;s eyes. &#34;You don&#39;t think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a measured sip, Eliana kept her face unreadable. &#34;She grew up in an orphanage. How could she possibly have access to something so rare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been wondering. Maybe she knows someone influential, or maybe there&#39;s more to her story. Why else would she join the Holden family at this time? Maybe she&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By planting these doubts in Eliana&#39;s mind, Gianna hoped to draw her to her side and make Grace&#39;s life a living storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her composed exterior, Eliana seethed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struggled to accept the reality-while she had been away, Rodger had brought home a daughter.To her, it felt like utter madness. Grace, already eighteen and a mystery, could only be interested in the family&#39;s wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagining someone else eyeing the inheritance sent a fresh wave of anger through Eliana. She had already made up her mind-Grace needed to disappear from their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the festivities for Ethel&#39;s birthday, Eliana resolved to extend her stay, determined to get to the bottom of Grace&#39;s sudden arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By next morning, the house throbbed with activity Both Carl&#39;s and Rodger&#39;s families lingered under one roof, turning the place into a hive of chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the stairs, Grace spotted Eliana standing with her back turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone approaching forty, Eliana still managed to look strikingly fresh-faced, her features echoing Ethel&#39;s grace and refinement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Grace drew closer, she caught Eliana&#39;s words to Julia. &#34;Julia, forgive my directness, but that girl you brought home? Word is she bounced through four different families at the orphanage, and she never even managed decent marks. Tell me, why on earth would you and Rodger take her in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scorn in Eliana&#39;s voice was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, who had never shared any warmth with Eliana,grew visibly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own history complicated things-Julia had no known relatives and her past remained murky thanks to long-buried memories. Rodger had welcomed her into his life without ever uncovering where she came from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel&#39;s initial disapproval had been štrong, especially since she had already chosen a bride for Rodger-one he rejected for Julia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since learning about Julia&#39;s uncertain background,Eliana viewed her with thinly veiled contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Grace in the picture, Eliana seemed eager to stir up trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s lips thinned as she retorted, &#34;Grace is sharp and well-versed in so many things. She even has the skill to heal people!&#34; Clearly, Eliana&#39;s only fear was sharing the family fortune with Grace.</p>
