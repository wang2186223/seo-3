                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s head upstairs and look at the jewelry.&#34; Claire kept a close watch on Gianna, noticing how bravely she forced a smile. The sight tugged at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet nod, Gianna said,-&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wandered through the fourth floor, led by Eliana,yet it was clear neither girl had any real interest in the displays around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often, Gianna&#39;s gaze drifted upward toward the fifth floor, her fingers twisting nervously at the hem of her blouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy simmered beneath the surface. She couldn&#39;t help but wonder just how many treasures Julia was buying for Grace this timne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on Gianna&#39;s distracted mood, Claire leaned close and whispered, &#34;Why don&#39;t we sneak a peek upstairs? It&#39;s not like the fifth floor is completely off-limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of worry crossed Gianna&#39;s face. &#34;But those membership rules are really strict...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s grin widened with mischief. &#34;We&#39;ll just say we&#39;re with Aunt Julia. Are they really going to throw us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly found a reason to send Eliana off and slipped into the elevator, determined to reach the fifth floor undetected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out, they barely took two steps before a security guard appeared in front of them. &#34;May I see your membership cards, ladies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chin lifted in defiance, Claire answered, &#34;We&#39;re with Mrs. Julia Holden. She&#39;s our aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard answered with practiced politeness,&#34;Seraphic Jewelry only allows members bring one guest. Mrs. Holden already has her daughter with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the fifth floor gleamed with new collections. Julia admired a glittering display. &#34;Grace,come here. What do you think of this bracelet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose the newest and most expensive diamond bracelet and slipped it onto Grace&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had Grace try it on.It hugged her wrist as if it belonged there, the stones throwing sparks under the showroom lights and making her skin look impossibly delicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The store manager exclaimed, &#34;Mrs. Holden, this piece couldn&#39;t suit her better. It&#39;s as if it was crafted just for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia beamed, completely pleased. &#34;Nothing could look finer on Grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s lips curved into a smile as she responded,&#34;Mom, I really don&#39;t need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a silly girl. Why wouldn&#39;t you want it?Gianna begged me for a bracelet just last year,swearing it would bring her good fortune. You&#39;re my precious child. How could I let you have less than anyone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for Grace to reply, Julia turned to the salesperson and asked her to wrap up the bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing look appeared on the salesperson&#39;s face as she offered flattery. &#34;Mrs. Holden, your taste is impeccable. This bracelet is unique, just like your daughter. She&#39;s as lovely as you, and when she wears this, it&#39;s as if she&#39;s the perfect ambassador for our store.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glowing with pride, Julia decided one bracelet wasn&#39;t enough. She added another, plus a dazzling ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the running total shot past ten million dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the number, Grace&#39;s brow furrowed. She discreetly texted Patrick, asking him to apply a discount before they paid. Letting her mother overspend on her account just didn&#39;t sit right with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick, on the receiving end, immediately set things in motion to make it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boredom had led Grace to open this store a few years back, and it had quickly turned into a booming business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Julia reached for her card to pay, the store manager hurried over, all respect and smiles. &#34;Mrs.Holden, as an Ultra VIyou automatically receive a special discount today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &#34;Really? I was sure this place never gave out discounts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a polished smile, the manager explained,&#34;You&#39;ve been with us a long time, Mrs. Holden. Our system automatically promoted you to Ultimate VIP. Today, you receive thirty percent off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace slipped her arm through her mother&#39;s and teased gently, &#34;Mom, it looks like you shop here often enough for the store to reward you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delighted, Julia squeezed her daughter&#39;s hand.&#34;See?You really are my lucky star. This is quite a savings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two left the boutique feeling cheerful after the unexpected discount.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, they came face-to-face with Claire and Gianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia stopped and asked, &#34;What brings you girls up here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire hesitated, searching for the right words. &#34;Aunt Julia, we were looking for you. It&#39;s almost lunchtime,and my mother thought we should all have a meal together.&#34; Thinking fast, Claire spun a reason on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being denied entry, frustration lingered, and confessing the real reason for their visit would have only made things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia accepted the explanation without question.&#34;Alright then. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lunch had been the plan anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejoining Eliana, the group gathered and made their way toward the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the elegant jewelry bags in Grace&#39;s hands, Gianna felt envy prick at her like a thorn.What was Julia thinking, spoiling Grace with so much jewelry? That jewelry had to be worth a fortune-easily more than ten million. Jealousy gnawed at her,impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly glance at Grace, Claire piped up with a sudden idea to eat somewhere extravagant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suspected Grace wouldn&#39;t know the first thing about fine dining-surely, she would trip over every bit of etiquette and embarrass herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Claire and Gianna longed for a moment to vent their irritation, hoping to catch Grace out of her depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing look passed between them, and Gianna was quick to play along. &#34;There&#39;s a really fancy place nearby. Let&#39;s give it a shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana chimed in enthusiastically, &#34;Sounds good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Julia nor Grace objected, so they went along with the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, the group set off toward the popular upscale restaurant, anticipation buzzing in the air.</p>
