                <p>Young lady, you shouldn&#39;t speak without understanding the situation. I&#39;ve been Mrs. Holden&#39;s attending doctor for years. Who would know her health better than I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob Blake, the specialist overseeing Ethel&#39;s care,didn&#39;t bother hiding his irritation. Being questioned by a young girl was clearly beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Precisely because you think you know her condition,her health has never truly improved,&#34; Grace replied,her voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are age-related issues! Full recovery is impossible. It&#39;s already a miracle we&#39;ve eased her symptoms!&#34; Jacob&#39;s frustration boiled over, his tone defensive and indignant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not that she can&#39;t be treated-it&#39;s just that her body won&#39;t return to what it once was. But stabilizing her condition and relieving her symptoms is achievable,&#34; Grace explained patiently, directing her words toward those with little medical background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for her parents, she wouldn&#39;t have bothered justifying herself, let alone speaking so gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to Jacob and Gianna, her calm reasoning sounded preposterous, like the ramblings of a dreamer who didn&#39;t understand science.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| believe Grace is right. She saved me when I was gravely ill: I might not be entirely cured, but I can now hope to live another twenty, even thirty years. If she could heal me, then helping Mom should be well within her abilities,&#34; Eliana said, her voice filled with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Eliana, it was the Master Healer who saved you. Grace only assisted. She shouldn&#39;t claim credit for that. And even if she did help, it&#39;s not the same thing. This isn&#39;t her field!&#34; Gianna countered quickly,her tone tinged with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana&#39;s illness had been gastrointestinal-nothing like the cardiovasc ular complications Ethel was dealing with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Gianna had never truly believed Grace had taken part in any surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. There&#39;s no need to argue anymore. Mom&#39;s condition is stable, so let Dr. Blake continue her treatment. We shouldn&#39;t change doctors without good reason,&#34; Carl said firmly, his voice carrying the weight of final authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Rodger away on urgent business, Carl&#39;s wNord held sway in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, whose husband was absent, chose not to push the issue further. She decided it would be best to let Ethel decide for herself once she regained consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was Ethel&#39;s health on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Grace and Julia left, the others gradually followed. Only Gianna remained, staying behind with a look of devoted concern, deliberately putting on a show as she sat quietly by Ethel&#39;s bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Ethel slowly opened her eyes. The first face she saw was Gianna, who had been part of her life since childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Gianna still there, apparently having stayed the entire night, touched her deeply. In that moment,she believed Gianna cared for her more than any of her own children did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, you&#39;re finally awake! I was so worried.Thank goodness you&#39;re alright,&#34; Gianna exclaimed,her voice trembling with emotion. &#34;Grace would&#39;ve made a terrible mistake if things went her way. Here,drink some water-it&#39;ll help your throat.&#34;Her reddened eyes conveyed a mix of relief and concern,though her words subtly cast Grace in a negative light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did she do to me?&#34; Ethel asked, alarmed by the implication that something had gone wrong while she was unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna hesitated, pretending to struggle with the truth before finally speaking. &#34;With her little bit of medical knowledge, she accused Dr. Blake of incompetence. She claimed you&#39;d suffer a stroke,become paralyzed, or even have a heart attack in three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That girl is wicked! Spewing such nonsense!&#34; Ethel burst out, her temper flaring. Her dislike for Grace grew even deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, such grim predictions sounded more like curses than concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her plan take root, Gianna felt a quiet wave of satisfaction. Everything was going exactly as she intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Beatrice wasn&#39;t ready to give up just yet.She had nearly earned Ethel&#39;s approval-until the old woman collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing that Gianna would never willingly reintroduce her into the family fold, she decided to take matters into her own hands. She would visit Ethel herself and try to win her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her plan in place, she swiftly prepared a pot of chicken soup and made her way to the hospital room Gianna had mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Holden family&#39;s wealth was unmistakable-Ethel was receiving specialized care in a spacious, private ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice swallowed her envy, straightened her posture, and knocked politely before stepping inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Ethel and Gianna were present-the setting was ideal for her to make a favorable impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Holden, how are you doing today? I made some chicken soup to help you feel better,&#34; Beatrice said,her voice gentle, her expression carefully arranged to seem sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s irritation flared at the sight of Beatrice&#39;s overly sweet demeanor. Ethel, however, was unappreciative as she had forgotten about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a little contemptuous of Beatrice&#39;s lowly origins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need; I have customized meals prepared by nutritionists. However, I&#39;m grateful for the gesture,&#34;Ethel answered.</p>
