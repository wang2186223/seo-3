                <p>The scene brought a grin to Julia&#39;s face. Of course,she wasn&#39;t oblivious-she saw straight through Gianna&#39;s petty little games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those years spent under Ethel&#39;s influence, and Gianna still hadn&#39;t learned better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully,Grace wasn&#39;t so easily bullied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd finally quieted, the commotion fading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seller stared,awestruck, at the brilliant gemstone,rubbing his hands eagerly. &#34;Name your price, young lady. Highest bidder takes it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare name a figure himself-not after someone had just offered fifty million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace remained calm, her voice even. &#34;I&#39;m not selling.I&#39;m keeping this piece for custom jewelry. It&#39;s for my mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Julia with a soft smile. &#34;Hope you&#39;ll like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s eyes lit up in surprise. &#34;For me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright, heartfelt smile bloomed across Julia&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A gift from my baby girl? I love it already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That warm, genuine moment didn&#39;t go unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton and Ryan just so happened to arrive across the exhibition hall in time to see the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Wait a second... isn&#39;t that the girl who treated you? The one with those insane medical skills?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t expected to run into her again. This girl never failed to surprise him. His curiosity kicked in instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton shot him a sidelong look, voice flat. &#34;Quit staring like that. You look like a creep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan scoffed, entirely unbothered. &#34;Creep? That&#39;s what we call admiration,buddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton ignored him, but his eyes were drawn back to Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood by a gemstone artisan, calmly discussing design ideas. The soft lighting outlined her profile-elegant, composed, and quietly radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan let out a low whistle. &#34;Damn... beauty, brains,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and now she&#39;s maste about gemstones too? I&#39;m officially intrigued. Who is she,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way a girl like that was ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton finally looked away, his voice cool. &#34;Who she is... has nothing to do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan smirked. &#34;Oho... now that sounded personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glare Colton shot him could&#39;ve frozen fire.Ryan quickly zipped his lips, but the sparkle in his eyes didn&#39;t fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, as if sensing the attention, Grace looked up -and her gaze met Colton&#39;s. She paused, then offered a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan grabbed Colton&#39;s arm with a burst of energy.&#34;She saw me! Bro, be honest-how&#39;s my hair? Did I mess it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusted, Colton pushed his hand away. &#34;Pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Grace finalized her design with the gemstone artisan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia watched as her daughter skillfully discussed intricate details, a swell of pride rising in her chest. In that moment, she realized-she didn&#39;t truly know everything about Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was full of surprises. She felt lucky to be her mom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back her curiosity, she asked, &#34;When did you learn all this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace paused a beat, then answered lighty,&#34;Picked up a few things from a master craftsman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t mention was that the so-called &#34;master&#34; was a reclusive legend in the gemstone world-and she had been his only student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone chimed at that moment. A call from Ethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia sighed. &#34;Looks like Gianna made it home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After losing the bet, Gianna had stormed off in a fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace handed the completed sketch to the artisan and gently wrapped an arm around her mother. &#34;Come on,Mom. Let&#39;s go back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they passed by, Grace slowed just a little as they neared Colton and Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan jumped at the chance, flashing a wide grin.&#34;Fancy running into you here, Miss Miller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace returned a polite smile and greeted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton gave Julia a subtle nod of greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan leaned in, tone light but sincere. &#34;You&#39;ve got a real gift for picking jade, Miss Miller. Maybe you could help me out next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dying to know more. The way Colton looked at her... it wasn&#39;t normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The infamous Colton Pearson-cold, distant,untouchable.Women never got close. People had even started speculating about his preferences... But now Ryan had ammunition to put those rumors to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Colton stepped forward, subtly positioning himself between Grace and Ryan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s time,&#34; Grace said evenly. Her eyes lifted-and locked with Colton&#39;s. There was something in his gaze. A quiet intensity that made her heart skip, just for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, let&#39;s go,&#34; Julia called gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace turned away, the moment sipping by, and disappeared into the crowd with her mother. Ryan rubbed his chin, grinning widely. &#34;Colton...something&#39;s definitely going on with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s expression remained unreadable. &#34;We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His recovery had been far quicker than anyone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>expected. But most people still thought he was dying -especially his uncle Harry. And judging by Harry&#39;s recent moves... he was getting bold. Maybe it was time to surprise him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan trailed after Colton. &#34;Hey, weren&#39;t we checking out those new stones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton didn&#39;t break stride. &#34;You seem restless.Maybe I&#39;ll send you to that remote project nobody wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan froze and zipped his mouth shut, miming surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Holden estate, Gianna knelt before Ethel, tears glistening in her eyes. &#34;Grace humiliated me in front of everyone...she forced me to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel&#39;s face darkened, her cane slamming hard against the marble. &#34;Outrageous! How dare she?&#34;</p>
