                <p>Grace knew the two men would keep pestering her if she didn&#39;t go along. She decided it was smarter to figure out their intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please follow me,&#34; Dominick said, practically glowing when she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Grace approached, her eyes settled on Colton, and a faint frown tugged at her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned out it really was the guy knocking on death&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick was just about to introduce them when Ryan Clark, Colton&#39;s friend, suddenly yelled, &#34;Colton! Are you having another attack?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton clutched his chest without warning. His skin lost color, his lips turned bluish, and he struggled to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s face shifted. She reached into her pocket,pulled out a small blue vial, tapped out a deep brown pill, and held it toward them. &#34;Make him take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan squinted at the odd-looking pill, his mouth twitching. &#34;You serious with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to be kidding,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stayed composed. &#34;Don&#39;t believe in it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton took the pill from her, rubbing his thumb across the surface, catching the sharp, clean scent of herbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not something you can just buy,&#34; Grace said calmly. &#34;Don&#39;t underestimate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her certainty made them hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan leaned in, murmuring, &#34;Don&#39;t take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pill like that, who knew what it could do if it went wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a short, humorless laugh and reached out her palm. &#34;If you&#39;re scared, then give it back to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was rare for her to offer anything like this; now she almost looked like she was pleading with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton didn&#39;t flinch. He tossed the pill into his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pill melted the instant it touched his tongue. A wave of warmth surged through his limbs, chasing off the chill that had settled in his bones and easing the stabbing pain in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shut his eyes briefly, then opened them again,blinking in disbelief. &#34;It works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t felt this relieved since the poison effects  began.Now,heat radiated through his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan turned to Grace, stunned. &#34;What was that pill you gave him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s lips lifted slightly. Her tone was easy.&#34;The kind that keeps him breathing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color slowly returned to Colton&#39;s cheeks, and the tightness in his muscles began to release. He drew in a long breath, the cold that had wrapped around his chest finally retreating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan&#39;s brow furrowed, his voice low. &#34;Your attacks are getting worse. At this rate, even Dr. Q&#39;s treatment won&#39;t be enough. We&#39;ve got to find that doctor, fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of Dr. Q, something unreadable crossed Grace&#39;s face, but she covered it up in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton looked over at her, his voice still unstable.&#34;Sorry for the trouble, Miss Miller. How did you pick up on the poisoning that day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t blink. Her reply came cool and clipped.&#34;I&#39;ve got eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan studied her, probing. &#34;Spotting that so fast,you must know your way around medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace rolled her sleeve back down, her tone flat. &#34;I know a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton could tell she was keeping her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a nod of thanks. &#34;Appreciate your help.Would you care to join us for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shook her head. &#34;I&#39;ve got to head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; Ryan stood frozen, watching her leave,completely thrown. Was she playing some kind of game, or just out of her mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every debutante in the city bent over backward to catch Colton&#39;s attention. And Grace? She bolted like she&#39;d been shot at.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton watched her retreating figure, his thoughts unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick leaned in slightly. &#34;What next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Colton could respond, a sudden tension gripped his face. A strange heat flared through him,sweat breaking out across his back. The sensation came without warning-sharp and overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan noticed the shift right away. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smacked the steering wheel. &#34;It&#39;s that pill, isn&#39;t it?No wonder she vanished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s jaw tightened. He loosened his tie, his fingers moving stiffly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had started as a gentle warmth was now burning through him like wildfire. But the strangest part was his legs, they itched and ached, like something was crawling beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive to the hospital,&#34; Colton said hoarsely, a vein throbbing at his temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan slammed his foot down. The SUV shot forward,tires screeching against the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the mirror, Ryan saw Colton&#39;s complexion deepen to a shade of red that screamed distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hang on, we&#39;re nearly there,&#34; he muttered, his voice strained, silently blaming Gace a hundred times over.If anything happened to Colton, she&#39;d answer for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; Colton suddenly lifted a hand, his voice filled with shock. &#34;I can feel my legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan whipped his head around. &#34;You serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton lifted his shirt, those poison-triggered bumps were fading,vanishing right in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was amazing.</p>
