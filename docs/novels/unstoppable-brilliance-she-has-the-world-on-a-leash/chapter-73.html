                <p>Grace tossed around several possibilities in her mind about the Devil. Could the person be a bald man in his middle years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People had looked into it from every angle, but the individual&#39;s true identity remained locked behind layers of national-level encryption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the person wasn&#39;t the result of a government training program, she guessed youth was off the table. There was no sign of a natural prodigy,either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick gave her a nod. &#34;I&#39;ll digaround and see if something turns up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his reputation for joking around, he took his assignments seriously when it counted most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, he had pledged his loyalty to Grace without reservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dangerous enemy fixated on her, he couldn&#39;t ignore the fact that her days would not be calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their enemy might not know her true background,but eventually, her social ties, connections, and daily patterns would be exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to unmask and destroy her, this foe would stop at nothing. Her team needed to stay alert and ready to outmaneuver them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re in charge of this, Patrick,&#34; Grace told him.She didn&#39;t expect much would come of it, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attacks aimed at those close to her or the places she managed were a real possibility, so she had to be ready for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Eliana&#39;s crisis managed, Grace slipped back into the routine of an ordinary student, quietly blending into the background at school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone with her credentials, sitting through lectures felt like a bad joke. She already held a postdoctoral degree, and several gifted scholars-Kevin and Terry among them-counted her as their mentor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, campus life provided the perfect cover, a way to stay invisible while plotting her next moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept at it partly because her parents hoped she would enjoy a happy student life. Letting them down was the last thing she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna,meanwhile, grew more uneasy every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since leaving the hospital, she noticed a subtle but unmistakable shift in how Rodger, Julia, and even Claire treated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t put her finger on it, but she was no longer the favorite girl she used to be. The trouble started when Grace entered the Holden family.She had been a thorn in Gianna&#39;s side from the beginning.Gianna refused to let things stay that way -she was ready to push back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Terry on the lookout for standout students,Gianna saw a golden opportunity. If she could impress him, a recommendation to the elite Summit University might be within her reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Support from all the faculty put Gianna in a strong position. If she managed to win over Terry,recognition and respect would finally be hers. That triumph would put Grace firmly in her shadow,proving that raw talent outshines connections and relentless hard work any day. A wave of calm washed over Gianna at the thought. She threw herseIf into thesis preparation, determined to dazzle Terry when the moment came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement buzzed through the campus on the day Terry made his appearance. Both students and teachers were keen to leave a good impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie offered Gianna a gentle push of encouragement.&#34;Gianna, the dean both picked you to greet Prof.Warren. This is your shot-make the most of it and let your strengths shine. Your thesis was crafted specifically for his research interests and ideas. I</p>
                
                
                
                <p>know he&#39;ll be impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie had spared no effort, delving into Terry&#39;s published work and academic pursuits to give Gianna the best possible advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Success today wouldn&#39;t just boost Gianna&#39;s reputation-it would elevate Ellie&#39;s standing as well,earning her respect and perhaps even a heartfelt thank-you from the Holden family. Everyone stood to gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a spark in her eyes, Gianna answered, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Ms. Dixon. My thesis is rock solid, and I&#39;m sure Prof. Warren will be pleased.&#34; Having kept up with the latest direction of his research, she was convinced this win was already hers. Once the recommendation letter was secured, she&#39;d be sure to repay Ellie for years of guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both teacher and student were riding high on hope when the department head swept in and dashed their dreams. &#34;Why are you two loitering here? Prof.Warren&#39;s already arrived-and Mr. Baldwin took Grace Miller to greet him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Both Gianna and Ellie cried out together.&#34;Grace is meeting Prof. Warren too? How did that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The department head gave them a withering look,worlds apart from the dean&#39;s usual patience. &#34;Grace Miller is our top student this year. Who else would we choose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Academic performance spoke louder than anything else at this school. Grace had achieved a flawless score, earning first place statewide-naturally, she would represent the institution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, that&#39;s impossible! She must have cheated!&#34;Gianna blurted out, unable to hide her frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Go ahead and try cheating your way to a perfect score. I&#39;d love to see you pull that off,&#34; the department head said, sarcasm in his voice as he raised an eyebrow. Rolling his eyes again, he left them standing there with their excuses sounding more foolish by the second.</p>
