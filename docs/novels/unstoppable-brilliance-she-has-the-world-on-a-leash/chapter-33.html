                <p>As evening shadows lengthened, Grace emerged from Ambrosia Dining and stepped into the gentle glow of dusk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A palm drifted to her softly swelling belly while she resolved to walk the rest of the way home,hoping it would help settle her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still savored the memory of dinner-Ambrosia&#39;s flawless ingredients and delicately crafted flavors had coaxed her into eating far more than she&#39;d planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meandering down the lively pedestrian street, Grace took her time, letting the world drift by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pace slowed and then halted altogether when she turned onto a quieter lane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up ahead, she caught sight of Johnny, hemmed in by a rough-looking group of young men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Johnny, a timid woman clung to his shirt, her wide eyes brimming with fear and her skin almost ghostly in the streetlamp&#39;s dim glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thugs,half-hidden in the shadows, looked all the more threatening with the faint light casting their faces in sharp relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better keep your nose out of this!&#34; shouted the ringleader, voice low and threatening. &#34;If you don&#39;t want trouble, walk away now, or you&#39;ll wish you had!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had every reason to ignore the scene. Still, the thought of Julia&#39;s inevitable worry måde her sigh-she couldn&#39;t just turn a blind eye. Setting her shoulders,she took a step forward to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny faced Tony with stubborn resoIve. &#34;Tony Reid,your reign of terror ends tonight. You&#39;re not pushing anyone around anymore,&#34; he said, voice unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking laugh came from Tony, who motioned to his crew. &#34;That&#39;s enough from you. Boys, teach him a lesson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny did his best to defend himself, managing to fend off a couple of attackers, but the odds quickly overwhelmed him. Before long, bruises blossomed across his face, a testament to the one-sided brawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing closer,Grace witnessed Johnny taking blow after blow from the gang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a second thought, she tossed her water bottle, and it smacked Tony right on the back of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who the hell threw that?&#34; A string of curses erupted from Tony as he spun around, clutching his skull.Spotting Grace, his expression shifted to one of predatory interest. A smirk crept onto his lips. &#34;Well look what we have here. Why not join me for a little excitement,sweetheart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s eyes widened in shock at Grace&#39;s sudden appearance. &#34;Grace! Why did you come? You need to leave right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace paid him no mind, striding confidently over.&#34;Quiet down. Now, someone tell me what&#39;s happening here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Johnny could speak, the frightened woman beside him choked out through her tears, saying &#34;They-they forced me to go with them...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony yelled from behind, &#34;Your old man owes my boss five hundred grand! He said we could have you until the debt&#39;s paid. It&#39;s only fair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horror flickered across the woman&#39;s face as she ducked behind Johnny for safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Grace&#39;s gaze landed on the angry red marks circling the woman&#39;s wrists-a silent testament to her struggle. A cold edge crept into her tone as she faced Johnny. &#34;Is she someone you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny straightened up, refusing to back down. &#34;She&#39;s Beatrice Green-my classmate. Stay out of this, Grace.I&#39;ve got this under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony cut them off with a wave of impatience.&#34;Enough chatter. Last chance-clear out, or you&#39;ll regret it just as much as he will!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady confidence, Grace eased Johnny behind her and spoke in a low, even tone. &#34;Walk away now, and I&#39;ll forget I ever saw you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, the thugs just stared, then their laughter rang out, mocking and loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tony stepped up, flashing a crooked grin. &#34;You&#39;ve got a mouth on you. Guess I&#39;ll have to teach you a lesson-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t let him finish. She seized his wrist in one smooth motion and drove her foot into his shin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gasp tore from Tony as his legs gave out, sending him crashing to the pavement with a howl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single thug had time to blink before Grace darted through them, swift and silent as a shadow. Each move flowed into the next, and every hit landed exactly where she meant it to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten seconds later, not one of the thugs was still standing-just a heap of bodies groaning in pain at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single cold word left her lips.&#34;Out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one argued. The would-be tough guys scrambled upright and took off as fast as they could. mo Johnny could only stare, his jaw dropping in disbelief.&#34;How did you... Where&#39;d you learn...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d never seen anything like it. In his mind, Grace was gentle, always careful not to upset anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could have imagined she&#39;d handle herself in a fight. If he hadn&#39;t watched it happen, he would have sworn it was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrug was all Grace offered. &#34;Turns out, I picked up a few tricks,&#34; she said, as if it were nothing special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t breathe a word of this to Mom,&#34; Johnny muttered,shifting awkwardly on his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing.&#34; Grace&#39;s gaze drifted over to Beatrice.Something about the woman set off quiet alarms in her mind. Pretty enough, but those restless eyes never once met hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Th-thank you... really, thank you both...&#34; Beatrice said,her hands wringing together, voice trembling. &#34;If you hadn&#39;t shown up, l-I don&#39;t know what would&#39;ve happened...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny tried to ease her worry. &#34;You&#39;re safe now. I&#39;lf see you home, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before moving off, he threw a look over his shoulder at Grace. &#34;Go on ahead. And remember-keep this between us, don&#39;t bring it up to Mom or Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little more said, Johnny and Beatrice disappeared down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shrugged it off. After all, they were just classmates and it wasn&#39;t her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her walk home was quiet and uneventful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Dominick received an update from the underground market that left him stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, there&#39;s wonderful news! Dr. Q has accepted the consultation request!&#34; Dominick&#39;s words shook with barely contained excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton could hardly hide his astonishment as the message sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope had been all but lost when it came to Dr. Q.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His backup plan had been to seek out Grace,especially since just one of her pills had already started purging the toxins from his system.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Dr. Q now agreeing to a meeting, the turn of events felt nothing short of miraculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it, Dr. Q&#39;s acceptance was due to nothing more than a fleeting good mood and a free schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brilliant minds often came with their quirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ntrigue buzzed through Colton&#39;s thoughts-he found himself more eager than ever to uncover the true identity of this elusive genius.</p>
