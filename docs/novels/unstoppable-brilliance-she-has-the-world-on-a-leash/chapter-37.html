                <p>Ellie observed as her colleagues gathered around their computers, eager to see how their classes performed,while she remained composed, confident that the honors students would lead the pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once most of the teachers had finished reviewing the results, a wave of mixed emotions swept through the room-some faces lit up with pride, others sagged in quiet disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One teacher leaned in and asked, &#34;Ellie, have you checked the honors class yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m about to,&#34; said Ellie. She logged into the grading portal and scanned through the exam data. The numbers were not impressive. However, knowing how challenging the test was, she found the results reasonable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each subject&#39;s average hovered at a respectable level,even if it dipped below what her class usually achieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie&#39;s eyes traced the list of scores, and she pressed her lips together in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the teacher beside her gasped. &#34;Wait, am I seeing this correctly? Someone check-who&#39;s leading Another teacher replied, &#34;There&#39;s no suspense. Gianna White must have taken the top spot again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, who else could it be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, really, come check for yourselves. Maybe I need new glasses,&#34; the teacher said, voice shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads swiveled towards the computer, and another teacher blurted out, &#34;It&#39;s Grace Miller. Look!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush swept through the office as every gazelocked onto the glowing screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace Miller? Are we talking about the same Grace who was accused of cheating?&#34; Elliemuttered,adjusting her glasses and hurrying over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was there, bold and undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had achieved a flawless score in every subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie stood in shock, rooted to the spot, while disbelief painted itself across every face in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I must be seeing things,&#34; a teacher blurted out,voice unsteady. &#34;Grace Miller transferred in halfway through the year, right? Everyone said she struggled to keep up and her grades were always at the bottom.What is happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeat seemed to wash over Ellie as she listened. Impossible! It made no sense that Grace could be this extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden thought flashed through her mind. Her tone sharpened. &#34;Pull up Grace&#39;s answer sheets on the projector.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room turned silent as the answer sheets appeared on the big screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s math responses looked flawless. Each step was laid out clearly, her solutions neat and to the point.For the last, trickiest problem, she even included two separate ways to solve it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching to the language section, her essay read with an effortless flow, her word choice sharp and authentic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What really stunned them was the essay&#39;s depth. It was filled with thoughtful insights and references,making it seem painstakingly written, not just dashed off in the heat of the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie watched, fingers trembling as she took in every word and number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A math teacher leaned closer to the display. &#34;Hold on,everyone, check out her approach on this last problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pointed to the screen and said, &#34;She used a technique from advanced college mathematics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There&#39;s no way that&#39;s in our curriculum!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos broke out in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where could she have learned that?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she start studying college material on her own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie thought back to Grace&#39;s transfer from a small school, where she had always ranked near the bottom.How could someone change so dramatically, so quickly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;None of this makes sense..&#34; Ellie muttered. &#34;She must have found a way to cheat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she had watched Grace from start to finish,knowing for certain that cheating had not occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie had seen her write every answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No other student managed a perfect score. Only Grace reached the highest mark in the entire school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The result opened the door for early university admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the reality sank in, Ellie felt a sharp sting of disappointment pierce her pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that Grace, once overlooked and underestimated, had surpassed her most promising students, left Ellie humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exams ended, and the school quickly rolled into a three-day break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace let Patrick know that he should arrange Mr.Pearson&#39;s treatment for two days from now, since her own schedule was packed for the next couple of days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh off a brief getaway, Ethel arrived home with her milestone birthday drawing near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had her hands fulI making plans, determined to make Ethel&#39;s eightieth birthday something memorable for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Ethel was back, Gianna wasted no time settling in at her place. Nobody protested her decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping into the room, Gianna hurried over, wrapping her arm around Ethel&#39;s with affection. &#34;Grandma,you&#39;re finally home! The trip must have worn you out.How about I work out the tension in your shoulders?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands moved expertly as she started massaging Ethel, who returned the gesture by patting her hand with fondness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile brightened Ethel&#39;s face. &#34;You always know how to look after me, Gianna. No one is as thoughtful as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression shifted when her eyes landed on Grace,Grace had offered a polite greeting upon arrival, but made no move to please Ethel, remaining stiff and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel called out, her tone turning chilly, &#34;Julia, Grace has a lot to learn about proper behavior. Our family sets high standards, and we must hold fast to them, or people will mock us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked straight at Grace. &#34;It&#39;s not surprising,considering she grew up in an orphanage. She&#39;ll have to pick up everything from the very beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Grace is making progress.She&#39;s putting in the effort, both with her studies and her manners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Making progress? I heard the exams just finished.Why not check her results and see for ourselves?&#34;Ethel&#39;s tone was dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna cast a smug glance at Grace, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. There was no doubt in her mind. Grace had likely stumbled on the exams.Everyone in the Holden family was expected to excel.For Grace, it looked like her time was almost up.</p>
