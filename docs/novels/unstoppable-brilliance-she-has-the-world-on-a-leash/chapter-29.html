                <p>Without warning, Sonia swept into the center of the room, her entourage in tow, her voice sharp and accusing. &#34;Grace Miller, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re the one who stole my diamond bracelet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Gianna staged her reaction,eyes wide as she pressed her hand to her lips. &#34;Grace, how could you? I can&#39;t believe this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brows knitted in confusion, Grace took in the accusing faces. Her voice stayed even as she replied, &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. What bracelet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia scoffed, flashing her empty wrist.&#34;Drop the act. My bracelet vanished, and you&#39;re the only one who came near me. If you didn&#39;t take it, then who did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs rippled through the group, the other girls quick to pile on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t trust someone raised in an orphanage. Anything shiny would be too much to resist!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check her purse! That&#39;s where she&#39;s hidden it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t let her get away with this, Sonia. You should call the police.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit Grace as she watched their accusing faces. Someone was clearly trying to pin the blame for theft on her. Her eyes shifted toward Sonia, and right then,she noticed that the diamond bracelet had vanished. With a steady voice, he looked around at the group and said, &#34;I didn&#39;t steal anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia retorted, pride in every word, &#34;Oh, so you&#39;re too frightened to admit what you did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have Sonia&#39;s diamond bracelet,Grace, please just give it back to her. She really cares about it. If it&#39;s jewelry you want,I&#39;ll buy you another one some other time,&#34;said Gianna softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of annoyance crossed Grace&#39;s face.&#34;I can&#39;t hand it over, because I never took it in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her response, Sonia reached for her purse, her patience worn thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace darted out of reach, leaving Sonia nearly off balance. &#34;What&#39;s your problem?&#34;Grace snapped, her stare icy and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia&#39;s tone turned sharp, her irritation fueled by the stumble. &#34;Got something to hide? Why don&#39;t you just let us look?&#34; Her voice rose, echoing across the room.&#34;Security! Come here quick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the noise pulled in even more curious onlookers, the crowd thickening as whispers rippled through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the gathering, Gianna watched with cold satisfaction, the corners of her mouth barely lifting in a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luck finally seemed to be tipping in her favor; she had spent the evening searching for a way to put Grace in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace Miller, how shameless can you get?Somebody saw you take it, yet you have the nerve to stand there and lie?&#34; scolded one of Sonia&#39;s friends, her eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Grace answered, lifting a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt about it now-they had set her up from the start. The entire situation struck her as almost amusing. She could not wait to see just how far they would push this spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act so innocent. You practically stared a hole through that bracelet when you walked past. You must have wanted it badly,&#34;Sonia&#39;s friend insisted, her voice thick with accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence followed as Grace took in the absurdity. The entire situation felt absurd. On what grounds did they level these accusations? Never once had she looked at Sonia&#39;s jewelry with any real interest. That lousy bracelet had no appeal to her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And before Sonia used the restroom, she tucked her bracelet into her purse. When she came back, it had vanished!&#34; another girl chimed in, desperate to fan the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We even found an attendant who claims to have seen you pocket the bracelet. There&#39;s a witness now, and you&#39;re still acting innocent?&#34; someone else added, piling on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement flickered in Grace&#39;s mind at the meticulousness of their little charade.Turning a keen eye to the attendant, she asked, &#34;Did you really see me take the bracelet, or are you just repeating what you&#39;ve been told?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous glance darted from the attendant,her words stammering out. &#34;Y-Yes, I saw you do it...with my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of this, Sonia! Let&#39;s get the authorities involved and end it now,&#34;someone suggested, eager for a spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the crowd, Gianna&#39;s lips curled in barely concealed triumph-having the police involved was exactly what she wanted all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s tone stayed even as she addressed everyone. &#34;For the last time, I didn&#39;t steal anything. If you&#39;re so set on accusing me,then by all means, call the police. But listen carefully...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, letting her words settle. &#34;If it turns out I&#39;m innocent, I&#39;ll take every one of you to court for slander. You&#39;ll be apologizing to me in public, and I&#39;ll be expecting compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the room hung in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Sonia remained unfazed. &#34;Fine by me.Call them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sirens wailed in the distance, and a team of police officers soon swept into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick rundown of the situation, the officer in charge turned to the group. &#34;Since the accounts differ, we&#39;ll need to search Miss Miller&#39;s belongings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unflinching,Grace handed her purse over,showing not a hint of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the zipper slid open, a hush fell over the crowd-a glittering diamond bracelet lay neatly inside her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s mine!&#34; Sonia burst out, seizing the bracelet and flashing a triumphant look at Grace. &#34;You can&#39;t deny it now. What have you got to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s expression turned cold, yet a slight smile curved her lips. She had seen this trap coming from a mile away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never laid a hand on that bracelet,&#34; she said coolly, casting a meaningful look at Sonia and Gianna. &#34;But I do wonder how it found its way into my purse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a commotion swept through the hall&#39;s entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall figure in a sharply pressed uniform,shoulders decorated with an officer&#39;s insignia, strode in with an air of unmistakable authority.</p>
