                <p>Once dinner ended, Rodger and Julia began gathering their things, ready to bring Grace home to their villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying at the family estate was a rare occurrence for them-reserved only for family events and major celebrations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to leave, Ethel summoned the pair into a private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated regally in her chair, Ethel tapped her cane lightly against the polished floor. &#34;I won&#39;t stand in the way of your decision to adopt her, but you should know something,&#34; she said, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial hush. &#34;Kids from orphanages have a reputation for sticky fingers. Keep a close eye on your valuables.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arguing would get her nowhere, and she knew it. For years,she&#39;d watched Rodger and Julia shower Gianna with affection and had been pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their sudden decision to adopt, especially a girl with no family and a past full of shadows, felt like a blow to the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown appeared on Rodger&#39;s face as he replied, his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tone firm, &#34;Mom, Grace is my daughter now. I will not tolerate talk like that ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, who was usually soft-spoken, surprised even herself with her sharp response. Her eyes flashed as she said, &#34;Ethel, you mustn&#39;t say things that would wound Grace. That child has done nothing wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Julia ready to defend Grace so fiercely made Ethel&#39;s temples throb. She pressed her hand to her forehead and waved them away. &#34;That&#39;s enough. You should leave.My head aches, and I need some peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving Ethel&#39;s room, Julia let out a puzzled sigh.&#34;Have you noticed your mom always seems to come down with a headache the moment we&#39;re together?Maybe she needs a doctor to check her over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger couldn&#39;t help but laugh, gently squeezing her hand in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Julia&#39;s gentle nature, he could tell her question wasn&#39;t meant to be overheard by Ethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Headaches are normal at her age,&#34; he said with a warm smile,leading Julia outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace waited for them on the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raindrops from earlier in the evening left puddles scattered along the sidewalk, and Grace stepped around them, her shoes never touching the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, an engine&#39;s roar filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A black Rolls-Royce Phantom tore down the street,flinging muddy water high as it passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lcy droplets threatened to drench her, but Grace slipped back just in time, letting the water crash harmlessly at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden screech shattered the night as the luxury sedan jerked to a halt nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping out, the driver rushed over, nerves on edge,sweat glistening at his temples. &#34;Please forgive me,miss. I was distracted. I didn&#39;t mean to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweeping invisible specks from her dress, Grace replied, &#34;No harm done. Make sure you pay attention in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her words were measured, there was a firmness to her tone that couldn&#39;t be missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across the driver&#39;s face-he hadn&#39;t expected such confidence from someone so unassuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, the rear window crept downward with a quiet hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep male voice sliced through the silence. &#34;Care to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>explain what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her eyes, Grace found herself staring at a man whose looks would draw any gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shadows from inside the vehicle hid most of his angular features, though his sharp nose and thin,unyielding lips were impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes held a glint that felt like cold steel pressed against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That first glance could chill anyone to the bone. Upon a second glance, Grace&#39;s pupils slightly contracted as she realized he carried a rare poison within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson, it&#39;s my fault. I was careless-&#34; the driver blurted out, nerves making his words tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, the man&#39;s elegant hand moved slightly, the cold glint of a Patek Philippe catching the last of the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed Grace with a knowing smirk. &#34;Apologies, miss.Tell me how much you want-I&#39;m in a hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was desperate to track down thelegendary healer,Dr. Q, before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flared in Grace, and she let out a bitter laugh.She tilted an eyebrow and surveyed him from head to toe her mouth curling into a wry grin. &#34;What&#39;s the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>rush? Afraid you&#39;re running out of time on this earth?&#34;she replied, her tone lazy and taunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. The poison will hold off for another six months. If you fail to cure it by then...&#34; She let her words hang, then continued, &#34;No doctor in the world will be able to help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton Pearson, still inside the car, stiffened. His grip on the checkbook tightened, turning his knuckles white.&#34;Come again? What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she know something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, I almost forgot.&#34; Grace&#39;s eyes drifted down his legs as if something clicked in her mind. &#34;You&#39;re dealing with both leg problems and sleepless nights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to walk away, but paused long enough to say, &#34;It&#39;d be wise for you to save your money.You&#39;ll need it for your recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had no intention of feeding his inflated ego.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving now, Grace.&#34; Rodger&#39;s voice, gentle as always,called from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, her mocking expression melted into a bright,genuine smile. She dashed towards Rodger and Julia without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, the driver could only stare, still rattled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>by what he&#39;d witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That girl had sharp eyes! Everything she had said seemed to cut Colton to the core-his poisoning,his paralysis, the restless nights-details scarcely whispered about, even in his own family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone else brave enough to speak to Colton in that manner had already vanished from this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his gaze never leaving her, Colton watched Grace vanish into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a lengthy silence did he turn away, his voice as chilly as a winter wind. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Rolls-Royce surged forward, tires humming along the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting inside, Colton studied his lifeless legs,absentmindedly tapping his fingers on the polished seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to know who she is,&#34; he said, his tone unwavering and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who exactly was that girl? How could a stranger pick apart all his ailments so easily? Was there a leak about his medical condition? Or did she possess real skill as a healer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions clouded his eyes, making his expression</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hard to decipher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His visit today was only because Dr. Q&#39;s presence in the area had reached his ears, so he came in search.Instead,he had stumbled upon a girl who was anything but ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, sir,&#34; his assistant replied from up front,his tone marked with respect.</p>
