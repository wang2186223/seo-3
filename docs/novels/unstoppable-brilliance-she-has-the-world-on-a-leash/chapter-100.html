                <p>Beatrice had been brimming with confidence,silently practicing just how she&#39;d play the role of the thoughtful guest to win Ethel over. Yet when Ethel met her efforts with such chilling disinterest-mixed with a dash of contempt-every ounce of her enthusiasm fizzled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind spun in confusion. Only yesterday, her attempt to curry favor with a simple massage had earned her a stream of praise. Was this sudden shift really all aboout her family&#39;s status?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each new thought brought fresh waves of humiliation. Instinctively, she glanced at Gianna,searching for some support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna,however, couldn&#39;t even be bothered to look her way. As far as she was concerned, Beatrice had made a fool of herself yesterday-and now she wanted to challenge her for Ethel&#39;s affection? The idea was laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced sweetness, Gianna addressed her in a voice soft enough for Ethel to hear. &#34;Beatrice, my grandma&#39;s just woken up. She&#39;s still fragile, and my uncle and aunt are on their way here now. How about you head home for a bit? I&#39;ll message you later, al right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice saw right through the sugary act. She knew Gianna had a talent for manipulation, and her reputation for scheming was well-earned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving then,&#34; replied Beatrice, her voice cool and measured, though inside, bitterness twisted tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she foreseen this outcome, never in a million years would she have risked crossing Julia the day before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely disappeared down the corridor before Julia and Rodger entered the hospital,trailed by James, Johnny, and-front and center-the family&#39;s darling, Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Ethel&#39;s fragile state, there was little surprise in seeing them put on a show of concern, regardless of whether their care was genuine or just for appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing the family into Ethel&#39;s room, Grace offered a polite greeting, but the old woman&#39;s response was little more than a dismissive glance. If anything, Ethel looked as if she wished Grace would disappear altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No offense was taken on Grace&#39;s part. She was only present out of consideration for Julia and Rodger.Affection was a two-way street, and she had long ago learned not to extend kindness where it wasn&#39;t wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to waste another moment on hollow exchanges, Grace slipped quietly out of the room,eager for a breath of fresh air-and a chance to check out the hospital&#39;s facilities for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just any private hospital, after all. Two of its founding doctors had earned international fame,and both had once been students of hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps carried her toward the elevators when she suddenly felt a gentle puIl on her sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grip was soft, almost hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to see who it was, Grace found herself facing Colton, every bit as striking as she remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t expecting you here,&#34; Grace remarked, one eyebrow arching in mild surprise. There was a time when seeing him in a hospital would&#39;ve made perfect sense, but these days his health stats were nearly flawless-he definitely wasn&#39;t a patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just dropping by for an employee who&#39;s unwell,&#34;Colton replied with ease. &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandma&#39;s sick. I&#39;m checking up on her,&#34; Grace answered, her expression unreadable. All the while,her thoughts whirred-what kind of staff member could prompt Colton himself to pay a visit? Clearly,this person held his deepest trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few more stiff remarks passed between them before both settled into silence. The silence hardly felt awkward-these two had always been comfortable with their own company, never needing words to fill the space. Onlookers might have felt uneasy, but to them, the hush was perfectly natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the lull, Colton broke it with a casual suggestion. &#34;Are you heading out now? How about grabbing a bite together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;I&#39;ll pass. My family&#39;s here-I&#39;ll be leaving with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, rejections didn&#39;t faze Colton, but her instant, unbothered refusal struck a chord of irritation he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low chuckle escaped him, and his gaze lingered on her for a moment. &#34;No wonder you&#39;re everyone&#39;s favorite. Always the obedient, well-mannered daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words had a playful edge, neither warm nor romantic-just teasing, and a little ambiguous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace accepted it with a shrug. That was true enough; in front of her parents, she played the role to perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Q,&#34; Colton called out again, voice dropping as if sharing a secret, &#34;lately, I can&#39;t shake this chill-feels like there&#39;s something still off inside. Maybe that old toxin flaring up? How about you come by and check me out? Name your fee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp gaze searched her bright eyes, searching for any hint of weakness. Most would miss the steel beneath her innocent appearance, which only made him more eager to push her buuttons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, you&#39;re probably just run-down.Try looking after yourself for once,&#34; responded Grace, deadpan and unbothered. Clearly, she had no doubt her treatment was flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in the hospital, Beatrice&#39;s phone buzzed-her mother&#39;s voice spilling through the speaker, full of complaints and demands for yet another doctor&#39;s visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless cycle of her mother&#39;s misery-usually sparked by her father&#39;s string of affairs-left Beatrice weary. Still, ignoring her mother would mean risking a public meltdown, complete with tears and drama right outside her school gates. That was a humiliation she couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving her phone into her bag with an irritated frown, Beatrice moved toward the elevator, but something just ahead brought her to a sudden halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within arm&#39;s reach, Grace was deep in conversation with a man-one so striking he seemed plucked straight from the pages of a fashion editorial. Every detail, from his composed demeanor to his custom-tailored suit, radiated power and wealth most people could only dream of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold confidence in his bearing was like nothing Beatrice had ever witnessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet there was Grace standing there, clearly on friendly terms with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory flickered. Could this be the mysterious man Chloe once mentioned, the one rumored to have picked Grace up from school?</p>
