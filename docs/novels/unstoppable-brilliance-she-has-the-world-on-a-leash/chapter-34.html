                <p>Until now, nobody had ever left Colton with such a profound sense of helplessness. Yet, The Dr. Q managed just that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories of her circulated like whispers-her presence always felt, yet her actual face never glimpsed,cementing her mythic status in the medical world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors were told of how, at just thirteen, she unraveled a neurological toxin mystery that had stumped experts for decades. By eighteen, she&#39;d already chalked up three hundred surgeries, each one a marvel of complexity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patient selection depended solely on her mood, as she gravitated toward the rarest and most formidable medical puzzles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No amount of money could sway her. For some, even vast sums meant nothing to her; she refused with a shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other times, she would waive her fees entirely, leaving both rich and poor baffled by her motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That she accepted Colton&#39;s case came as an unexpected twist, a stroke of fortune nobody could Still, the timeline would not be rushed-the treatment would begin only after she finished wrapping up exams at a certain high school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick continued to remind Colton of the importance of good rest. The upcoming procedures would be demanding and require every ounce of strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A respectful voice interrupted Colton&#39;s thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, the car is ready. We can leave whenever you wish,&#34; Dominick said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nod from Colton signaled his readiness. &#34;Alright, let&#39;s head out.&#34; The plan for the day was set: he&#39;d be joining his family at the estate for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandmother, Isabella Pearson, had called repeatedly, making sure the dinner was not to be missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearson Estate, the sprawling estate of the family, lay tucked away in Briskvale&#39;s most expensive district.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Iron gates eased open as Colton approached, and a chorus of servants called out,&#34;Welcome home,sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton barely offered a nod in reply. Sharp cheekbones and a severe jaw lent his face a striking edge, while his steely gaze radiated an almost intimidating chill.Every step he took seemed to ripple with authority,unsettling those nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before he entered the living room, the unmistakable sound of ridicule floated through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Colton&#39;s a model in every respect-except for that little matter of being poisoned. Not much time left for him now. Why bother clinging to life with a body so broken?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These cutting remarks belonged to his uncle, Harry Pearson, who spun a ruby ring on his finger, his suit immaculate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush settled over the group at his words, but it quickly dissolved into sly laughter and whispered conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the truth. Everyone says only the elusive Dr. Q could fix a case like his, but who can say if such a person really exists? Colton&#39;s future is anybody&#39;s guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One more voice joined in, scoffing, &#34;I still don&#39;t see how someone as fragile as him can run the company.Isn&#39;t that just asking for disaster? If he drops dead, the whole business goes with him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steaming mug rested easily in Harry&#39;s hand as he sipped his coffee without a care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chatter drifted from the relatives flanking him, their words soaked with discontent and veiled complaints about Colton,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contentment shone in Harry&#39;s expression; he was quite at home in this atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the second son, Harry always saw himself as a natural heir to the family fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pearson blood ran wide, but true leadership was in short supply among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tradition dictated that the eldest, Clifford Pearson-Colton&#39;s father-should have assumed command after the old patriarch&#39;s passing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had intervened when Clifford&#39;s life was cut short by a fatal accident years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expectations shifted to Harry, who believed he would claim the seat at the head of the table, only for the old patriarch to pass the torch to Colton in his final hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Colton&#39;s poisoning did nothing to sway Isabella&#39;s faith; she insisted her grandson keep the reins, much to Harry&#39;s anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion colored every thought Harry had-he was certain Colton was behind the decisions, so their exchanges always dripped with biting remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton pressed on without missing a beat, a frosty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick, trailing behind, bristled with indignation at the conversation, but a single warning glance from Colton kept him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Colton entered, his voice sliced through the room&#39;s false cheer. &#34;Why the sudden silence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence swept through the living room in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how they grumbled, not one person could ignore Colton&#39;s extraordinary skill in business. With astonishing speed, he had transformed Pearson Group,sending its market value soaring to three times what it once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even illness did little to dull his edge-rivals still hesitated when facing him across a negotiation table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Harry cradled his coffee and forced a pleasant grin.&#34;Back so soon, Colton? You caught us right in the middle of talking about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone gave no hint that he&#39;d just been running Colton down seconds earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, deliberate sweep of Colton&#39;s eyes took in the room before coming to rest on his uncle. &#34;Funny. You seem more preoccupied with my condition than l am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smile of Harry&#39;s faltered for a heartbeat, but he quickly masked it. &#34;Family always comes first. I&#39;ve even at most started reaching out to Dr. Q, hoping she&#39;ll agree to take your case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s reply was even and cool,every word weighted with subtle authority. &#34;You seem to know quite a bit for someone on the sidelines.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no patience for more interference from Harry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Colton had set out to find Dr.Q, Harry had done everything possible to throw obstacles in his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calculating glint flashed in Harry&#39;s eyes. &#34;Be cautious. Dr. Q&#39;s reputation for being both hard to find and a bit unpredictable makes her a risky bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of a smirk appeared on Colton&#39;s lips. &#34;Your concern isn&#39;t needed. Though, word is your overseas venture has hit some rough waters. The board isn&#39;t pleased,I hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of panic crossed Harry&#39;sfeatures, and he almost lost his grip on the delicate mug. Colton had a knack for hitting nerves right where they were exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension crackled in the hall, thickening the air until it was almost hard to breathe.</p>
