                <p>From the sidelines, Johnny stood frozen, eyes wide with disbelief as Grace dominated the basketball court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he&#39;d been wrong about her all along. In his mind, she had always been just another pretty girl without a clue-how wrong he&#39;d been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the audience, Beatrice&#39;s jaw tightened, frustration spilling from every word. &#34;Hmph, nothing but blind luck. No reason for her to act so smug.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For as longas she could remember, she held the spotlight and basked in everyone&#39;s admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,though, every gaze was fixed on Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of the game, there was no doubt-Grace would walk away as Briskvale High&#39;s new sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scoreboard flashed a twenty-point lead, and wild cheers shook the bleachers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For their rivals, it was the worst defeat in recent memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s teammates swarmed around her in a blur of excitement. &#34;Grace Miller! That was unreal! You&#39;re the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>real MVP!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed off the praise with a gentle smile.&#34;Everyone played their part. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the gym, Johnny sat slouched on the bench,his thoughts tangled as he watched her. Only now did he begin to wonder if he ever truly saw the real Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice stomped over, envy lacing her words. &#34;Don&#39;t get too full of yourself. You only got lucky coming off the bench.Big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave no answer, choosing instead to turn and walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she left, Johnny&#39;s voice cut through the noise.&#34;Grace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and glanced over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth moved hesitantly before he finally muttered,&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s acknowledgment was brief-a small nod-before she walked off, Adrianna falling in step beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, students buzzed with energy, the thrill of the game echoing in every conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, Johnny hobbled into the Holden</p>
                
                
                
                <p>house,wincing with each step. Julia&#39;s eyes narrowed with concern as soon as she saw him. &#34;What happened to you, huh? Did a wild animal chase you home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny let out a dramatic sigh. &#34;Seriously,Mom? I&#39;m your own son. Can&#39;t you act worried for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia snorted. &#34;If I didn&#39;t care, you wouldn&#39;t still be in one piece.You&#39;re fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Grace stepped up, pressing a smnall bottle of liniment into his hand. &#34;Try this for a couple of days. You&#39;ll heal up just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia wasted no time in pulling Grace close for a warm hug.&#34;You&#39;re always so thoughtful,sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away,Johnny pretended not to notice, the sight stinging more than he cared to admit.Sometimes he wondered if he&#39;d somehow been switched at birth. Grace fit in so naturally, it was as if she belonged more than he ever did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Grace, did you hear? The Aurora Gem Fair&#39;s happening this weekend.&#34; Julia&#39;s face brightened as the memory of the invitation came rushing back. Her voice rang with excitement. &#34;We&#39;re all heading there together. I want you two to see something truly unforgettable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Count me in, Mom,&#34; said Grace, her lips curling into a warm grin. Of course, she already had her own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>invitation tucked away. Still, tagging along with everyone else suited her just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weekend rolled around before anyone realized it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger called everyone together and they piled into the car, ready for the outing. Word had spread that the fair would showcase a breathtaking assortment of rare jewels this year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, Gianna made sure she wasn&#39;t left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant she heard Rodger and Julia would bring their kids to the fair, she wasted no time letting everyone know she planned to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d attended countless gem fairs before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For those in the upper crust, knowing gemstones was a mark of true breeding. No one wanted to look clueless in front of society&#39;s sharpest eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her moment to make an impression on Rodger and Julia, a chance to remind them she was still the Holden to watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated from Gianna. Her knack for choosing the best raw stones had never failed her.Most of her picks ended up revealing rare, expensive minerals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot a sidelong glance at Grace, who gazed quietly out the window, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wait,&#34; she muttered to herself. &#34;It won&#39;t be long before you&#39;re put in your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car pulled up outside the bustling exhibition hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the Aurora Gem Fair had blossomed into an extravagant affair. Everywhere one looked, influential faces mingled and the atmosphere buzzed with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every booth seemed to sparkle with an array of polished gemstones and a multitude of rugged,untouched mineral stones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most eyes, however, were drawn to the main attraction-the suspenseful mineral auctions, where every unopened rock might hide a small treasure or a life-changing windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna strolled along the aisles, her lips curling into a sly smile. &#34;Grace, I can&#39;t help but notice you&#39;ve been staring at those uncut stones for ages,&#34; she chimed,her tone syrupy sweet. &#34;Why don&#39;t we spice things up with a little bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had waited for a moment like this andfinally saw her opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace looked over, catching the bold sparkle in Gianna&#39;s eyes with ease. A faint smile appeared as she replied, &#34;Alright. What are the terms?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s expression lit up with anticipation.&#34;Whoever loses has to stand in front of everyone, declare herself an idiot, and jog around the hall yelling it for all to hear.Agree?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words practically dripped with anticipation-she could already picture her victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing delighted Gianna more than the thought of humiliating Grace, and she planned to film every humiliating second for the school to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s brows pinched together. &#34;Gianna, there&#39;s no reason for family to place silly bets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s smile became strained. Did Julia actually think Grace couldn&#39;t withstand a little embarrassment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tiny protest only made Gianna more eager to prove her point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to let her mother worry, Grace gave Julia&#39;s shoulder a reassuring pat. &#34;It&#39;s all right, Mom.Gianna wants a game. I&#39;ll play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met Gianna&#39;s stare, her voice steady. &#34;Agreed.Let&#39;s keep it fair-no running away if you lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt flickered in Julia&#39;s eyes. &#34;Are you sure about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the family knew Gianna&#39;s reputation-her years spent examining gemstones had made her something of an expert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, on the other hand, had never even set foot in such circles until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the moment slipping away, Gianna jumped in before anyone could reconsider. &#34;Absolutely, I accept the challenge. No way I&#39;m backing out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was little point in arguing, so Julia finally gave up,releasing a resigned sigh. The stage was set. The two girls focused on the glimmering piles of uncut stones, their friendly competition now in full swing.</p>
