                <p>No need for the gratitude. I didn&#39;t do this for you-it was for my parents.&#34; Grace didn&#39;t sugarcoat anything. With people she didn&#39;t care much for, she saw no reason to be polite or spare their feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just being honest. If Eliana hadn&#39;t been her father&#39;s sister, she wouldn&#39;t have wasted her time trying to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time was precious to her, and she didn&#39;t give it away freely-not unless it was for the people she loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana understood the message behind Grace&#39;s bluntness. She didn&#39;t argue with it either. But her opinion of Grace had started to shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People naturally admired those with true skill. And Grace, despite her age, had just pulled someone back from the brink of death with calm precision.That kind of ability drew respect, even from those who didn&#39;t like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,although Grace didn&#39;t act warm, Eliana wasn&#39;t offended. In the end, Grace had saved her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t talk much beyond what was necessary.They weren&#39;t close enough to chat about personal things, and both knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace kept it professional. She explained the next steps in Eliana&#39;s recovery plan clearly and thoroughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her approach wasn&#39;t like that of most doctors. And with the help of the Rejuvenation Pill, the entire recovery process would be smoother. The pain would be easier to manage, and the illness wouldn&#39;t last as long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If things went according to plan, Eliana could return to a normal life in under three months-as long as she stayed away from heavy drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Grace finished explaining, she didn&#39;t stick around for pleasantries. She turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t close, and staying would only make things feel stiff. Besides, she had more pressing matters waiting. She didn&#39;t have time for small talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Grace left, Claire came in,followed by a servant carrying a tray of food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Claire, I need to talk to you. And I need you to listen carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you being so intense?&#34; Claire asked nervously. For a moment, she feared her mom&#39;s condition had suddenly worsened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Grace. She&#39;s not someone you want as an enemy. And be careful around Gianna. Instead,spend more time with Grace. And I mean it-genuinely befriend her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace wasn&#39;t ordinary. She was sharp, capable, and never one to tolerate games. If treated with sincerity,she&#39;d return it tenfold. But if anyone tried to trick her or treat her with false kindness, she&#39;d walk away without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-what? I thought you said Gianna was mazing, and that we should stay close so we can look out for each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she realized this wasn&#39;t a health scare,Claire&#39;s tension melted, and everything else felt less important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was before. Things have changed. Just. do what I say, Claire. I wouldn&#39;t lead you wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana had once hoped that Gianna and Claire would form a strong bond-they were cousins, and Gianna seemed dependable, polite, even admirable. It had felt safe to put her trust there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, looking more closely, Eliana had begun to see through the surface. Gianna was cunning. Claire,on the other hand, was too trusting, too straightforward. She might be used or misled without even knowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Grace was different. Eliana had watched her closely. She felt sure that Grace was discreet and would never play dirty tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire might not realize it now, but building a true friendship with Grace could change her life for the better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Eliana didn&#39;t know yet was just how right she was-and how much she would one day thank herself for this decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the hospital, Grace didn&#39;t go home. She had arranged to meet Patrick instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a new assignment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They met at one of their company&#39;s private wineries.It was secure and quiet, with only their people around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick asked the moment she arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If something new was brewing, especially something involving higher powers, it had to be handled carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not quite,&#34; Grace replied. &#34;No new task-just a warning. Word is, the Devil from the northern faction has his sights on me. He doesn&#39;t know who I am yet,but he&#39;s searching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had been aware of the tension between the northern and southern factions for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was state-trained, handpicked for elite operations. Her real allegiance wasn&#39;t to the Holdens -it was to the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That idea might sound cold, like she was property,not a person. But she didn&#39;t flinch from it. She&#39;d made peace with it and was committed to the missions given to her. She was their best asset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the so-called &#34;Devil&#34;, that was a nickname she and Patrick had come up with in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t know exactly who the person was. What they did know was that he was the northern faction&#39;s secret weapon, just like Grace was for the southern side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, just as she couldn&#39;t figure out who the other person was, they couldn&#39;t easily find out who she was either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fragile balance was exactly why the two factions remained divided. Neither one was willing to step back or give the other the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What if they find out who you are?&#34; Patrick asked.&#34;They&#39;d probably try to kill you.&#34; He was concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can try,&#34; Grace said with a small shrug. &#34;But the state wouldn&#39;t let that happen. They&#39;ll protect me.&#34; She gave him a confident look. &#34;I&#39;ve got my own people too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Grace was cherished by her faction&#39;s leaders and had no intention of ever betraying them,she still built her own safety net, her own circle of people she could count on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, no matter what happened, she wouldn&#39;t be left defenseless.</p>
