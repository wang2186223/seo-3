                <p>Adrianna greeted Grace, a shy smile playing on her lips. &#34;Sorry for making you wait. I&#39;m running a little behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I just arrived myself,&#34; Grace replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her purse, she retrieved a small white jar and placed it in Adrianna&#39;s hand. &#34;This is the cream I blended for you. Apply it to that dark mark before bed,and you&#39;ll start to see the spot lighten up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright hope flickered in Adrianna&#39;s eyes as she accepted the small jar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncapping it, she caught a fresh, gentle scent with a hint of lavender soothing her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think this&#39;ll do the trick?&#34; Adrianna asked, her voice trembling as she lightly touched the mark clinging to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a quiet grin. &#34;Stick with it for a month.You&#39;ll start to see the difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s awesome!&#34; Adrianna said, nodding with excitement as a grin spread across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked the cream into her purse like it was something precious, her chest swelling with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That dark mark had made her easy prey for cruel nicknames and side-eyes ever since grade school.Nothing from the drugstore ever lived up to its promise, no matter how often she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, there was something about Grace that made her want to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Grace&#39;s eyes, the problem looked easy to fix.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna was already imagining her skin clear and glowing.She could almost see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later on, the two of them started shopping. Shopping was rare for Grace, and today felt like a treat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They roamed through shop after shop, grabbing a few tops, earrings, and whatever caught their eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace picked up a smooth silk scarf for Julia. Adrianna found a fluffy pair of slippers for her grandma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Grace finally got back home, she heard voices drifting in from the living room as she unlocked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused in the hallway, wondering about the unexpected voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside, Grace&#39;s eyes landed on Gianna.Wasn&#39;t she supposed to be spending the week at the estate with Ethel? What was she doing here now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions swirled in Grace&#39;s mind until Julia spotted her, coming over with gentle hands to relieve her of the shopping bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back,sweetie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I went out with a classmate. We did some shopping,&#34;said Grace without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gianna lounged on the sofa, idly snacking on grapes. The moment she caught sight of Grace&#39;s shopping bags, envy sparked behind her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated how all the attention kept drifting away from her. In her mind, it should&#39;ve never left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, missing the sharp edge in the room, smiled like everything was fine. &#34;It&#39;s nice having friends around.Don&#39;t spend all your time holed up at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added with a light chuckle, &#34;Just so you know,Ethel won&#39;t be home recently. So Gianna&#39;s staying with us for a while. You two can keep each other company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the day, Gianna used to drop by all the time.Julia,having no daughter of her own, treated her like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, though, Gianna felt that spotlight had shifted elsewhere since Grace&#39;s arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave Julia a polite nod. &#34;Alright. Thanks for letting me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made sandwiches. There are cheese and veggie ones, and a few with shrimp and corn. I couldn&#39;t decide what you liked, so i made a little bit of everything.&#34; Julia&#39;s voice was bright with pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Grace paused, and a gentle warmth crept into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of her childhood spent in orphanage and with different foster families left her unfamiliar with the comfort of a real home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That changed now, with Julia moving through the kitchen, treating her as if she had always belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to go through all that trouble,&#34; Grace said softly, barely lifting her gaze. &#34;I&#39;m not picky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia just laughed and tousled her hair. &#34;If it makes you smile, it&#39;s worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby,Gianna&#39;s hands balled into tight fists, her nails digging deep into her skin. Watching this unfold was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>enough to make her stomach twist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of magic had Grace pulled on Julia? This was supposed to be her spotlight. Grace wasn&#39;t even family.Just some girl they let stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s fragile health had always been the reason she never cooked. Even Rodger and the boys made sure she rested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, she was in the kitchen like it was her stage.All because Grace walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every gesture, every smile, every bite of affection Julia handed over looked like something Gianna had been robbed of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frustration boiled over. She threw her voice across the room with fake sweetness. &#34;Grace, Aunt Julia went through all that trouble just for you, even though she&#39;s not feeling great. Better eat up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sounded friendly, but the sarcasm was hard to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension thickened around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace turned to her, lips curved into a slow, deliberate smile. &#34;Relax, Gianna. If my mom makes me food, I&#39;m finishing every crumb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s expression went stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, completely unaware of the brewing feud,kept her gentle tone.&#34;Don&#39;t just stand there. Gianna, would you like some sandwiches too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a grin as fake as a toy, Gianna waved her off. &#34;No thanks. I&#39;m cutting carbs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glare was all she gave Grace, thinking to herself that just seeing her was enough to kill an appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food was not the reason Gianna came today. Before Ethel left, she had pulled every string she could to score a stay at Rodger&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secretly, she made a promise to herself-she would find a way to push Grace out of the Holden family,no matter what it took.</p>
