                <p>&#34;What do you mean by this?&#34; Johnny asked, his brows furrowed in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace truly was an odd one. He had been in the middle of sharply rebuking her, laying bare his frustration and disappointment, when she suddenly extended a bank card toward him. What exactly was she trying to say with this gesture?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re upset about what happened today,and I do regret losing my temper and hitting Beatrice,&#34; Grace said softly. &#34;This is my personal bank card. I know Dad suspended yours, so I&#39;m giving you mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time Grace had ever been so compliant-so unusually eager to make amends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she didn&#39;t actually regret slapping that two-faced Beatrice. If anything, she&#39;d do it again without blinking. But there was no reason Johnny</p>
                
                
                
                <p>needed to know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re giving this to me? Are you serious?&#34; Johnny asked, still eyeing her with skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. I&#39;m serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not worried I&#39;ll max it out?&#34; he pressed. The card was nothing special-just a regular debit card,certainly not the sleek black one their mother had once handed her, the kind that came with no spending limit but didn&#39;t allow cash withdrawals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This one probably held whatever meager savings Grace had managed to squirrel away through her frugal habits. Honestly, it might not even be enough to buy Beatrice a full skincare set before it hit zero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Grace said evenly. In truth, it would take a lot more effort than he realized to drain her account.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny paused, battling with himself in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he drew himself up, adopting a tone he imagined sounded firm and effortlessly cool. &#34;Alright then, since you&#39;re insisting, I&#39;ll accept it. But you better not lay a hand on Beatrice again, understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Grace replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And stop being so cold and withdrawn,&#34; he continued, gaining steam. &#34;When you see me,say hi and smile. Focus on your grades instead of selling those shady, unapproved products at school. It reflects badly on the family. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny blinked, taken aback by how easily she agreed. The long, stern lecture he&#39;d rehearsed in his head suddenly felt unnecessary. He cleared his throat. &#34;Okay, you can go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace turned to leave. She had barely taken two steps when Johnny called after her, &#34;Wait-I don&#39;t know the PIN!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll text it to you,&#34; she replied sweetly, flashing a soft smile over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wide-eyed, innocent look made Johnny waver.For a split second, he wondered if he&#39;d been too harsh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he quickly shook off the guilt trying to creep in and waved her away. &#34;Never mind, just go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t afford to go soft. Tomorrow, he was going to use that card to get Beatrice something nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Grace said with a nod and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door clicked shut behind her, a small,triumphant smile curled on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d played Johnny like a fiddle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she hadn&#39;t apologized properly. And no, she hadn&#39;t comforted him either. But it was all for his own good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew without a doubt that he would end up using the bank card to buy luxury gifts for Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her time in the Holden household, she had kept her distance on the surface-but in truth, she had been carefully studying each family member&#39;s personality. She had figured out early on that Rodger and Julia genuinely cared about her. James, for all his soft-spoken charm, was emotionally detached. And Johnny? He was hopelessly blinded by love. He never spent on himself, always savng his allowance to splurge on Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Beatrice&#39;s flings with other men eventually surfaced one day-as Grace knew they would-Johnny wouldn&#39;t even try to take back the gifts he&#39;d showered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, things had changed. From this moment forward, every shilling Johnny spent on Beatrice would be Grace&#39;s money. Each transaction would be clearly documented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the breakup finally came, Grace would make sure Beatrice returned everything she had taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace wasn&#39;t the type to let things slide. Anyone who.dared to mock or challenge her would eventually face the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time was right, she would repay them-not equally, but double.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within just a few hours, Grace&#39;s phone had been buzzing nonstop with bank alerts-each one for a modest transaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed by the constant interruptions, she eventually switched her phone to silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected Johnny to be this restrained.For someone born into privilege, he was surprisingly tight-fisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was still testing the waters, trying to confirm if her card truly had enough funds for him to spend freely. Or maybe he hadn&#39;t started shopping for Beatrice yet and was just easing into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was fine. Grace was certain it was only a matter of time before he began using her card to spoil Beatrice with expensive gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Beatrice started receiving them regularly, her greed would only grow. She would begin to expect more-demand more-never satisfied with what she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If, by then, Johnny managed to open his eyes and cut ties with that vain, materialistic woman, it would be a relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not, he would be the one left broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because he was no match for someone as manipulative and cunning as Beatrice.</p>
