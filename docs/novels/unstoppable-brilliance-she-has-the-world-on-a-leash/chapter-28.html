                <p>Light from the grand chandelier spilled across the hall, mixing with the scent of expensive perfumes and the buzz of animated conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each step, Grace moved through the entrance, her blue dress catching the glow and creating a halo around her, the fabric whispering over her skin and exuding a dreamy sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, heads turned in her direction, their admiration barely concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by a lively group, Gianna caught the sudden shift as attention drifted to the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze snapped toward the entrance,and there was Grace, moving with a calm confidence that made Gianna&#39;s hands curl  tightly at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone nearby leaned in close, voice dropping to a whisper. &#34;Who is that girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the girl the Holden family adopted from an orphanage,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks so refined-honestly, even more elegant than Gianna tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not so loud. Gianna&#39;s right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? She&#39;s just crashing with Ethel. If Rodger and Julia really cared, wouldn&#39;t they have adopted her themselves? Makes you wonder,&#34; one woman said dismissively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every sly remark drifted into Gianna&#39;s ears,making her smile feelbrittle at the edges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a slow breath, collected herself,and made her way toward Grace,champagne glass in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There you are, Grace.&#34; Her words rang out sweetly, though tension tugged at every syllable. &#34;I&#39;ve been searching for you   everywhere-l worried you&#39;d gotten lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle, almost amused look crossed Grace&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;m fine. You should go enjoy your friends. I can take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having Gianna nearby would only stir up more drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blunt dismissal took Gianna by surprise.Barely managing to keep her smile, she leaned in, her voice soft with fake concern.&#34;You&#39;ll find a lot of well-connected girls here tonight. You&#39;re new to all this, so just be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace nodded with quiet confidence. &#34;appreciate it. I know how to handle myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved by Grace&#39;s composure, Gianna masked her irritation with a heavy sigh.&#34;Alright, but let me know if you need help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away, she sank her heels into the plush carpet, each step carrying her frustration further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huff of irritation escaped her, hidden by practiced poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her manners remained flawless, but deep down, she wished nothing more than for Grace to trip up in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from the entrance, Sonia Richardson -the host&#39;s daughter-caught Gianna&#39;s eye and gave an enthusiastic wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Gianna put on a sweet smile and hurried over to greet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that the new addition to your family?&#34;Sonia asked, linking arms and sending a pointed look Grace&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice and putting on an air of reluctant acceptance, Gianna replied,&#34;That&#39;s her. My uncle brought her home from the orphanage. She bounced around foster homes before landing with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words barely faded before a cluster of girls surrounded them, voices bubbling with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It all makes sense now-she doesn&#39;t have that classic high-society look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She may look the part, but I wonder if she has what it takes beneath the surface.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re being generous, Gianna. Personally,I don&#39;t know if l&#39;d be so gracious with an unexpected addition to the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her glass, Gianna let the bubbles linger on her tongue before replying with a soft,measured tone, &#34;It&#39;s all been decided by the family. My job is just to keep an eye on her,nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet behind her gentle words, a cold spark lit her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Festivities rolled on, lively and bright, as the clink of crystal and bursts of laughter filled the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the laughter and cheer grated on Grace&#39;s nerves, only strengthening her distaste for such events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Craving escape, she made her way toward the open terrace to breathe in the cool night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely started down the corridor before a cluster of girls stepped into her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia lifted her arm, letting the chandelier&#39;s light dance across a bracelet studded with diamonds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk polayed on her lips as she addressed Grace, her words dripping with pride. &#34;Take a look. This was made just for my eighteenth-there&#39;s nothing else like it anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my, it sparkles so much! It&#39;s absolutely stunning. I wish I had something like that,&#34;said Sonia&#39;s friends, unable to hide their awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sweet voice laced in admiration,Gianna suggested, &#34;Sonia, only someone as refined as you could do justice to a piece that special.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling her eyes, Grace masked her irritation behind a blank expression. Honestly, did these girls have any pastime beyond endlessly heaping praise on one another?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lazy glance at Sonia&#39;s prized bracelet told Grace all she needed to know-those diamonds looked disappointingly puny, and whoever cut them clearly lacked skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to wonder-was this spectacle really about a bracelet so mediocre?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s thoughts wandered to the plain box stashed beneath her bed, filled with loose stones that made Sonia&#39;s accessory look like a child&#39;s toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady voice, Grace asked, &#34;Would you kindly let me through?&#34; Without waiting for a reply, she continued on her way toward the terrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snickers and whispered insults trailed behind her, saying, &#34;She&#39;s never even seen real jewelry before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a moment on the terrace, Grace soaked in the peace before slipping away toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she stepped outside than a female attendant in crisp uniform thrust an accusing finger in her direction, her voice rising above the chatter. &#34;That&#39;s her! I saw it with my own eyes-she&#39;s the one who stole it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, every head turned, the air thick with judgment from the watching socialites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s lips pressed together in a thin,annoyed line. What was this lunatic going on about now? Why was she suddenly the villain of the attendant&#39;s story?</p>
