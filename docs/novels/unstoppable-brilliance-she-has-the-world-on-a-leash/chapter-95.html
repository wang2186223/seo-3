                <p>It was the weekend, a rare day off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, who had always been an early riser thanks to her strict internal clock, had gradually been spoiled by Julia-gently coaxed into the habit of sleeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her previous foster home, she was dragged ou of bed by seven sharp every morning, expected to cook breakfast and run errands like an unpaid maid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But here, at the Holden household? She once got up at seven, strolled around the house, and didn&#39;t see a single person awake. She figured she might as well go for a jog, only to run into Julia-who had happened to rise early-and Rodger, already dressed for work. That was the day the couple discovered Grace didn&#39;t sleep in, even on weekends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had been appalled. Without hesitation, she swept Grace back to her room, motherly affection written all over her face as she said, &#34;Grace, this is the Holden family, not one of those dreadful places you used to live. You should sleep in until the sun is high in the sky. That&#39;s perfectly normal here. You&#39;re still growing, and getting more sleep is good for you.We don&#39;t have a habit of getting up early on rest days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished, Johnny came downstairs and objected, &#34;Mom, how can you say that? You always told James and me that we should build good habits by going to bed early and getting up early!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia looked momentarily embarrassed, but Rodger quickly jumped in to support her. &#34;Johnny, you must have misheard. Go back to bed and get more sleep-you&#39;re still growing too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? At this hour, they usually dragged him outside for morning exercises. And now? The rules had changed just like that. Johnny grumbled all the way back upstairs, but he was secretly thankful for.Grace&#39;s influence-it meant a rare lazy morning for him,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All in all, it was Julia and Rodger&#39;s doting nature that had slowly encouraged Grace to adopt this new routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today, she didn&#39;t have the luxury ofsleeping in.She had to get up early to visit Ethel with Julia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d heard about it the day before. Apparently,Ethel&#39;s health was declining, and she wanted her family close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana, who had recently undergone major surgery,was also staying at Ethel&#39;s residence to recover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like the perfect time for Grace to check on Eliana&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger had an important meeting at the company and couldn&#39;t go with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny had already made plans to play basketball with his classmates. And James, being the future successor of the Holden Group, had to tag along with Rodger for hands-on experience at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left Grace to accompany Julia alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? Nothing beats having a daughter!&#34; Julia sighed warmly. &#34;Those boys are always off dloing their own thing. But having a sweet daughter by my side, now that&#39;s real comfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver dropped them off at Ethel&#39;s residence.The old lady was basking in the morning sun out in the garden, munching on snacks and looking perfectly content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was surrounded by people, like a queen flanked by her loyal attendants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them were familiar faces-Gianna, Claire,and Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was taken aback when she saw Beatrice. Why had she come here? Grace recognized the issue as soon as she saw Beatrice sitting near Gianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julia, Grace, you&#39;re here! Come join us; we&#39;re enjoying some desserts,&#34; Eliana called out cheerfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just past nine in the morning-an ideal hour to indulge in dainty dessers and elegant pastries while basking in leisure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Grace had saved Eliana&#39;s life, the latter no longer looked at her with disdain. Instead, she greeted Grace with warm enthusiasm, fully aware that her continued health-and perhaps survival-depended on Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how wealthy or influential one might be,aging and illness were inevitable. With someone like Grace in the family, Eliana had learned to adjust her attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,.not everyone saw it that way. Some still questioned whether Grace had truly saved Eliana,convinced she was merely basking in Kevin&#39;s reflected glory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, you&#39;re just in time. I&#39;ve heard from Gianna and Beatrice that you&#39;ve been neglecting your studies and started a business?&#34; Ethel spoke up, her tone sharp and disapproving. Every time she saw Grace,a headache seemed to follow. Without a blood connection, it was difficult for her to feel any genuine affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Eliana swore by Grace&#39;s role in her recovery, Ethel still refused to believe it. How could a girl under twenty lead a high-risk surgery that lasted over ten hours? It sounded absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments earlier, Gianna had whispered that Grace wasn&#39;t focused on school anymore and had begun selling skincare products. The notion disgusted Ethel. Was the Holden family so poor that Grace had to resort to such petty sales? It felt like a stain on their reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Grace was trying to win their approval, Ethel was far from impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, you could say that. They really wanted it,sol tried to get some for them,&#34; Grace replied calmly.These weren&#39;t just any products-they were high-end skincare items once reserved for royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ridiculous! You&#39;re a student-you should be concentrating on your studies. What exactly are you trying to prove?&#34; Ethel snapped, her irritation bubbling over. Grace always seemed to get under her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ethel, how can you say that about Grace?&#34; Julia most interjected, her usual gentle demeanor shifting as her tone turned firm. &#34;If she has the ability to manage this, it&#39;s a good thing-far better than burying herself in books alone.&#34;</p>
