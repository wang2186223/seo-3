                <p>A new guest stepped into the gathering, drawing immediate interest from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Dixon family had long been one of the city&#39;s most respected names, and Myla Dixon stood out for her effortless charm in social settings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked in gracefully, linking arms with a younger girl and greeting the room with a warm smile. &#34;This is Demi Miller, the daughter of a close friend.I thought it was time she got acquaintedwith our circles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi wore a rose-red dress that stood out boldly among the muted tones around her. Her makeup was flawlessly applied, and there was a quiet confidence in the way she carried herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her chin slightly lifted, she scanned the room calmly. Then her eyes landed on Grace. Her pupils shrank in surprise, and a faint crease formed between her brows. Why was Grace here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s lips thinned, and her fingers curled into her palms before she noticed. She hadn&#39;t come all this way just to be upstaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since crossing paths with Marvin Dixon, Myla&#39;s son,she had devoted herself to fitting the image the Dixons admired-spending months mastering the art of brewing artisan coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with the Millers and Dixons working closely together,her engagement to Marvin was almost within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, Myla had brought her along to help ease her into society, a crucial move if she were to marry Marvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lois greeted them graciously. &#34;Myla, what a lovely surprise.And Miss Miller,you carry yourself beautifully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myla gave a soft laugh, waving off the compliment.&#34;You&#39;re too kind. She&#39;s a little reserved, so I thought it best to let her get used to the environment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,with an almost casual tone, she turned toward Julia. &#34;I heard Mrs. Holden recently took in a daughter.What a heartwarming update.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression remained pleasant, but her eyes shifted slightly, a fleeting sharpness behind the smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was history between them. Myla had been smitten with Rodger the moment she met him,convinced he was the one she would marry.Her parents had encouraged it, viewing the Holden name</p>
                
                
                
                <p>as a valuable connection in the upper circles. Ethel,too,had seen the potential in a union between their families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Rodger had felt nothing for Myla. He defied every expectation and chose Julia instead, a woman without wealth or pedigree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew how deeply he loved her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Julia was in her forties, she carried the glow and vitality of someone ten years younger, poof of how deeply Rodger&#39;s affection had nurtured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This,more than anything, unsettled Myla. Seeing Julia stirred old bitterness that had never quite faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own marriage had been arranged for convenience,not love. After giving birth, her husband had drifted away.He now lived elsewhere and rarely visited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What gave her leverage, was her son. That alone earned her some respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When word got out that Julia had adopted a girl from an orphanage, Myla couldn&#39;t help slipping in a cutting remark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s expression remained serene. &#34;I appreciate your interest, Mrs. Dixon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Myla spoke again. &#34;I heard she was raised in an</p>
                
                
                
                <p>orphanage. You must share a special bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true. I treasure Grace deeply,&#34; Julia said without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short distance away, Demi picked up on the subtle tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave an innocent blink. &#34;Grace? I didn&#39;t expect to see you here! I didn&#39;t realize you were into coffee culture too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted. Conversations stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded with poise, her smile calm. &#34;I am.And it must have been challenging for you to pick it up so suddenly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the words were polite, Demi caught the sting beneath them. Her fists tightened at her sides.She wasn&#39;t going to let that pass. Not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was determined to outshine Grace and put her where she belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the other women remained quiet,but not oblivious. Whispers had long suggested that the Dixons were planning a deeper alliance with the Millers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that their families were working together,a formal union felt inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Millers had only recently climbed into the city&#39;s elite, and an arrangement with the Dixons would seal their place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one spoke of it openly, of course. But every guest there knew exactly what was unfolding, they just played along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Lois spoke up with a cheerful tone.&#34;Ladies, the spring roast is ready. Let&#39;s take our seats and enjoy a tasting,shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests began settling down, each finding their place in front of a carefully arranged coffee set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be long before someone was called upon to demonstrate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Demi, this marked her first experience in such a setting, and the excitement was hard to contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Mliller name had only recently begun to gain recognition, unlike the long-established lineages of the others present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past, she never had access to gatherings like this. Today, it was the Dixon family&#39;s reputation that had opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, she&#39;d immersed herself in coffee brewing and floral arts, determined to leave a strong impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, she&#39;d like to make sure Grace saw the difference between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Myla turned to Lois with a light suggestion.&#34;Lois, perhaps it&#39;s time the younger ones share what they&#39;ve been learning. Demi&#39;s been training with a top barista lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That sounds lovely! Please, go ahead,&#34; Lois replied with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi lifted her chin slightly, her smile composed as she rose from her seat. Moving with practiced grace,she stepped up to the demonstration table, ready to display her technique.</p>
