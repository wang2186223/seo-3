                <p>Long ago, Gianna never gave a second thought to anyone she deemed unworthy of her attention,always careful to guard her image and standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That changed as Grace gradually stole her spotlight. She became eager to find an ally who also hated Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, it seemed Grace had made it her mission to stir up trouble between Beatrice and Johnny, causing Beatrice&#39;s dislike for her to grow sharper with each passing day. Gianna believed the prospect of joining forces felt too good for Beatrice to pass up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Beatrice, it hardly mattered if the friendship with Gianna was shallow, as long as there was something in it for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, both girls found common ground and decided to work together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans were set: Gianna would grant Beatrice access to the Holden estate, opening doors to high society.In return, Beatrice would spread whispers and turn the tide against Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the deal was sealed, each moved on as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna caught up with Grace, worry written on her face. &#34;Grace, they&#39;re saying Beatrice&#39;s at it again,dragging your name through the mud. Is it true?&#34;Not long before, she had overheard a pack of girls in the hallway, their conversation circling around Grace,Johnny,and Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors were swirling that Grace had a strained relationship with Johnny and was jealous of Beatrice.Some students even accused Grace of being insatiable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe,Beatrice&#39;s loyal companion, played ringleader,always ready with a fresh rumor to damage Grace&#39;s name. Unable to bite her tongue, Adrianna had confronted Chloe then and there, and their spat nded any hope of friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Grace waved it off. &#34;Let them gossip.I know what I&#39;m doing, and I&#39;ll come out just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience had taught her how to keep the upper hand. Laying out her strategies in silence, she preferred to wait until everything reached a boiling point before making her move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna breathed easier. &#34;That&#39;s a relief to hear,&#34;she said with a soft smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new kind of confidence had taken root in her.Grace had become someone she looked up to,pushing away her old insecurities and choosing, at last, to carve out her own happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shot her a look of warning. &#34;You&#39;d better stay alert. Chloe&#39;s got it out for you now, and she doesn&#39;t let things go easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna nodded with conviction. &#34;I&#39;ll look after myself,&#34; she replied, genuinely uplifted by Grace&#39;s caring words. Her admiration for Grace only deepened in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, Grace had other things on her mind. Her thoughts wandered to Johnny, wondering if he&#39;d let his temper get the best of him once he got home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t Johnny she feared-it was the possibility of upsetting Julia that truly bothered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Grace&#39;s last car incident, Julia insisted on being the one to fetch Grace from school. Whenever she couldn&#39;t make it, the family&#39;s driver filled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, Grace stepped through the doorway greeted not by silence but by Johnny&#39;s raised voice echoing through the house. &#34;Mom, you have to stop handing Grace so much pocket money. And quit buying her all those clothes and gifts. She&#39;s getting all the wrong ideas from school!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flared in Julia&#39;s eyes. &#34;You loudmouth,that&#39;s enough! Compared to you and your reckless spending, Grace is a breath of fresh air. If anyone&#39;s losing credit card privileges, it ought to be you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Johnny had strutted around, making promises to Beatrice that he&#39;d persuade his parents to pull the plug on Grace&#39;s spending money. Now, fate had flipped the script. Instead of cracking down on Grace, his mom had set her sights on his own allowance. How ironic-it was as if he&#39;d dug his own grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to defend himself, he blurted out, &#34;Why are you coming after me, Mom? I&#39;ve barely spent a thing lately! Grace is the one setting up shop at school,selling things she shouldn&#39;t. What if she gets in trouble? Our family could be implicated!&#34; His rant echoed through the hall just as Grace appeared,catching every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he&#39;d been caught bad-mouthing her, his face turned red for a brief second, but pride wouldn&#39;t let him back down. He lifted his head and squared his shoulders, telling himself he was only speaking the facts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, spotting Grace at the door, quickly abandoned her frustration with Johnny. &#34;There you are, darling.I&#39;ve been waiting for you to come home so we can eat together. Wash up and join us at the table,&#34; she said,her tone softening instantly for her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fearing Grace might take offense, Julia leaned in,her voice gentle. &#34;Don&#39;t pay any mind to what Johnny said. He doesn&#39;t mean any of it. Deep down, he cares about you; he&#39;s just shy, really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of confusion crossed Grace&#39;s face. Shy? Since when had Johnny ever acted shy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an exaggerated sigh, Johnny said, &#34;Mom, you&#39;re so unfair. Am I actually your son? Honestly, I&#39;d prefer not to have this sister!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia only smiled, turning to Grace. &#34;See what he does? Every time he opens his mouth, he says the exact opposite of what he feels. He loves having you around, but he&#39;s terrified you&#39;ll dislike him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny groaned, frustration building. How was he supposed to defend himself when his mother twisted everything he said? If anyone was being misunderstood,it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching this unfold, Grace felt a twinge of guilt, as if she&#39;d stolen some of Julia&#39;s love away from Johnny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had lost her patience. &#34;Johnny, move out of the way. If you keep running your mouth, you can just stay at school instead of coming home,&#34; she snapped, her irritation clear. It was no secret-daughters were easier to love. Johnny just kept causing headaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the swagger he had shown in front of Beatrice evaporated. It was obvious now-his mother played favorites. Maybe he wasn&#39;t even her real child;maybe he really had been picked up off the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia turned her attention to her daughter. &#34;Grace,let&#39;s see you top your old record. Why not have more than one plate tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger chimed in, encouraging her, &#34;She&#39;s right Grace. You&#39;re still growing. Eat plenty so you&#39;ll be tall and strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every meal now became a showcase of affection,with both Julia and Rodger doting on Grace, urging her to eat more-sometimes even playfully challenging her appetite. Wanting to please them, Grace managed a plate and a half, though she felt stuffed to the brim by the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Johnny sat at the table, ignored and invisible, whether he finished his food or left it untouched</p>
