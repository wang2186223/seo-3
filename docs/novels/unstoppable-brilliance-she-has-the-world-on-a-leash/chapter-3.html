                <p>Ignoring the stunned expressions of the Millers,Rodger&#39;s stern look softened as he turned to Grace.&#34;Come along. Your mom is waiting for you at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words brought an odd rush of emotion that Grace hadn&#39;t felt before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment,she struggled to put the sensation into words. It felt as if winter&#39;s chill had brushed up against a warm sunbeam-strange and new,but she could not bring herself to pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s hand slipped into hers. With a quiet voice, she asked, &#34;Grace, Mr. Holden is here for you. Do you want to go with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin, Grace searched Rodger&#39;s face. Her tone was soft, but her question wvas direct. &#34;Are you ever going to send me away without warning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger felt a pang in his chest, one he had not expected. At first, adopting a daughter had meant little to him; he agreed only to satisfy his wife&#39;s hopes.For a family as wealthy as theirs, taking in a child was hardly a significant act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, looking into Grace&#39;s anxious, stubborn eyes -the same eyes that reminded him of his wife-he realized he was determined to keep her as his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved a little closer, offering her a look that was both unwavering and kind. &#34;Never. From this moment forward, you belong with the Holdens. That won&#39;t ever change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ella&#39;s tense shoulders relaxed as relief washed over her. She trusted that when Rodger gave his word,it was as good as set in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Grace stepped forward. All around,the Miller family watched in shock as she headed toward the fleet of luxury cars that marked a life of privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this moment on, she would no longer be overlooked. She would be cherished and protected as the Holdens&#39; beloved daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expressions of disbelief and uncertainty flickered across the faces of the Miller family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, being freed of the responsibility of caring for Grace seemed like a blessing in disguise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, among society&#39;s elite, nothing was ever simple. Grace&#39;s fiery spirit might soon see her returned to the orphanage-history had a way of repeating</p>
                
                
                
                <p>itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the luxury cars made their way to the heart of the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace rested in silence, her backpack settled on her knees. Inside, she carried just a handful of clothes, a compact laptop, and a phone with a design all its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, she unlocked the screen and read an encrypted message. &#34;So, Ms. Fowler set you up with a new family?&#34; The words were cautious, almost hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She typed a simple response. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her habit of brief replies did not seem to bother the sender, who quickly followed up. &#34;The Holdens have their own set of complications. Should we rethink things since they aren&#39;t part of our plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes lowered, she said nothing, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments ticked by before the next message appeared.&#34;Anyway, reach out if you need anything. Want me to take action on your behalf?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded without hesitation, &#34;Take back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everything I gave to the Millers. If they believe they can manage alone, let them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when she had first joined the Miller family, she had poured her efforts into helping them. Their fortunes had soared because of her support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in the car, Rodger&#39;s phone rang.He picked up, and Julia&#39;s warm voice spilled through the line,bubbling with excitement. &#34;Sweetheart, is our daughter with you? Tell me what she enjoys eating,and I&#39;ll make sure the chef prepares her favorites!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Grace&#39;s reflection in the rearview mirror,Rodger&#39;s lips curved into a gentle smile. &#34;Yes, she&#39;s here with me. She&#39;s truly one of a kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed as the car zipped down endless stretches of highway, finally slowing as their destination drew near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pinnacle Estates, the crown jewel of the city, was home to the Holden family. Only the city&#39;s most influential and wealthy could claim a place in this rarefied neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among properties where even a patch of land was considered a prize, the Holdens&#39; home boasted sweeping gardens and an artificial lake that shimmered beneath the afternoon sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Luke had dared to imagine calling this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>neighborhood home, though such dreams had always been far out of reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their luxury cars glided down a smooth driveway, and Grace peered through the window, taking in the estate&#39;s grand architecture that rivaled a royal palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger stepped out first and walked around to open her door. He guided her along winding garden paths where every blossom seemed perfectly arranged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awaiting them inside, the rest of the Holden family had already gathered in the spacious living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the center of it all, an older woman sat in the place of honor. Though she spoke not a word, her presence alone held everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfectly coiffed silver hair framed her face, and pearls glimmered at her ears-Ethel Holden, the respected head of the household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Ethel&#39;s right sat Carl, her eldest, joined by his own family. Rodger was her second son. The youngest,Eliana, now lived overseas with her husband. Beside Ethel stood a young girl in a crisp white dress, Gianna White, a relative Ethel had taken in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, this is my daughter, Grace,&#34; Rodger said with unusual tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An immediate hush swept over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With calm assurance, Grace lifted her head and met their gazes. Not a hint of unease touched her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plain white blouse lent her an air of quiet confidence, striking even among the lavish surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief second, the family was taken aback. They had expected a timid girl fresh from the orphanage,but the confidence she exuded left them speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hold back any longer, Julia stepped forward in her flowing gown. Her arms closed tightly around Grace, her voice trembling with happiness. &#34;Grace,I never imagined we would be brought together like this. My heart is so full. We&#39;re a family now, and nothing will change that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her secret to herself-that wish whispered every night, hoping Grace would be free again so she could give her a real home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wrapped in Julia&#39;s embrace, Grace caught the soft scent of iris perfume and felt a wave of comfort. For the first time, she realized what warmth truly meant.</p>
