                <p>Beatrice hadn&#39;t expected Grace to say that to Johnny.Could Grace have actually noticed something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way. She had been extra cautious-picking quiet spots, always looking over her shoulder. There was no way Grace could have seen her with any man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of garbage are you talking about!&#34;Johnny snapped, his voice rising sharply with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few heads turned from nearby tables in the library,brows furrowed in irritation. He forced himself to lower his voice but still glared at Grace, clearly fuming. &#34;Stop trying to stir things up between me and Beatrice. She&#39;s not that kind of girl. If you ever bad-mouth her again-even if Mom&#39;s around-I&#39;ll teach you a hard lesson!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny, are you really saying you&#39;d hit me-even if Mom were standing right there?&#34; Grace looked at him,wide-eyed, her face a picture of innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;-&#34; His words caught in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew his mother had always sided with Grace. To an unfair degree. She&#39;d spoil Grace endlessly and scold him for the smallest things. If she ever found out he laid a finger on Grace, she&#39;d probably beat him herself and throw him out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, he couldn&#39;t help but feel like he was the one adopted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, just don&#39;t say anything bad about Beatrice again. I trust her,&#34; he muttered, sounding far less sure of himself now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. Mom asked you to come home early tonight for dinner. Don&#39;t stay out too late,&#34; Grace said as she turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind, she looked like the same sweet girl as always-but up close, there was a mischievous curve to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice must have overheard them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, the truth would surface. And now that Grace had caught on to Beatrice&#39;s game,Beatrice might react soon. Once she did, it would only be a matter of time before everything unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace hadn&#39;t forgotten how smug Beatrice had acted during the whole same bags fiasco.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she had some free time, she figured it wouldn&#39;t hurt to stir the pot a little-especially if it meant exposing Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she owed it to her parents to protect her clueless brother from being played like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dinner? As long as you&#39;re home for dinner, no one really cares if I show up or not,&#34; Johnny muttered, the bitterness slipping out before he could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, just as he remembered something important,he let out a soft curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had wanted to ask Grace about hacking stuff. But somehow, she had completely thrown him off. He hadn&#39;t gotten to ask a single question before she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then again... what would she know about internet and computers anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Johnny,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a sweet, familiar voice said. Beatrice walked over with a bright smile that looked so natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s mood instantly lifted. That smile always worked on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here to study?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm-hmm.&#34; she nodded. &#34;Exams are coming up, sol need to put in the extra hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about that reminded Johnny of Grace&#39;s question. &#34;Do you study at home every day?&#34; he asked suddenly. &#34;You haven&#39;t... been going out or eating with anyone else, have you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, Beatrice could&#39;ve handled such questions with ease-made up some sweet excuse or laughed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after overhearing his talk with Grace, his questions instantly made her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt pressed down on her chest, and suddenly,every word he said felt like it was hiding a deeper meaning-like he was testing her without saying it outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced her nerves down and gave him a soft,practiced smile. &#34;The exams are so close-l&#39;ve been locked in with my books at home. I want to get into the best university in the city.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even tilted her head and blinked sweetly,looking completely innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Johnny saw that face, any doubts he had vanished. He didn&#39;t question her further. Instead,he mentally scolded himself for listening to Grace&#39;s nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Beatrice he knew, even with her modest upbringing, was hardworking and fulI of drive. Her smile could light up a room, and she always seemed genuinely kind. She&#39;d often ask him to tag along to buy snacks and feed the stray cats and dogs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way a girl like her was mixed up with shady older men. Grace was probably just trying to stir things up-or maybe she&#39;d gotten it all wrong!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling guilty for ever questioning Beatrice, Johnny reached out and gently took her hand. &#34;Would you tutor me sometime? I want to get into the same university.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning behind his words was clear-he wanted to stay with her, even after graduation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This love-struck boy would stay wNrapped around her finger, offering whatever support he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t handle the family money, but he saved faithfully, and while it wasn&#39;t nearly as much as what she got from other men, it still added up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, he was good-looking, and his family name carried weight. He might not have much now,but he was bound to be wealthy someday. It was just a shame his mother was so tightfisted, never givinghim enough allowance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Beatrice planned to keep him close while quietly getting what she needed from other men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, she tucked those thoughts away and gave a shy smile. &#34;But my grades aren&#39;t as good as Gianna&#39;s. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to ask her instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she didn&#39;t mean it. It was just part of her act.</p>
