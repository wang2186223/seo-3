                <p>Grace&#39;s instincts had whispered to her from the start when she accepted the challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson.&#34; She gave a small nod, addressing him directly.&#34;We can start your treatment now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are the most recent lab results and reports,&#34;Dominick said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing the papers aside, Grace replied, &#34;I won&#39;t be needing those. They&#39;re as useful as a broken clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such tests,to her mind, were pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Diagnosis came as easily as breathing for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodney&#39;s pride stung, so he tried to intervene. &#34;Mr.Pearson, you shouldn&#39;t listen to this woman. She&#39;s not who she claims to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Colton cast a flat stare at Rodney. &#34;I trust her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes narrowing, Grace met Rodney&#39;s gaze. &#34;If your knowledge falls short, it doesn&#39;t mean everyone&#39;s does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another physician, nerves frayed, asked her with a raised voice, &#34;Do you realize who you&#39;re speaking to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Powell&#39;s reputation reaches every corner of the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it really? If that&#39;s true, why is Mr. Pearson still suffering? Seems pretty shameful, if you ask me,&#34;Grace replied flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration made the doctor&#39;s words come out sharp.&#34;You think you&#39;re so clever. Let&#39;s see what miracle cure you think you&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every approach they had tried had already failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the so-called &#34;Master Healer&#34; had surrendered to the situation. Yet here this young lady stood, speaking as if the outcome were already certain. It took nerve to stand against them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait and watch. The answer will come soon enough,&#34;Grace replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodney&#39;s patience snapped. &#34;So this is the famous healer? She&#39;s probably just a fake who got lucky once or twice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the other doctors attempted to ease the tension. &#34;Let&#39;s give her a chance. If she fails, she won&#39;t make it out of here by morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention away from the chatter, Grace addressed Colton. &#34;We can begin now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton moved aside, catching Dominick&#39;s eye with a mvlle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without needing further instruction, Dominick sprang into action, handling the preparations smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest kept the other doctors rooted in place, eager to witness Grace&#39;s methods. Many of them doubted her. Some even waited for Colton to throw her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the treatment room, Grace quickly unpacked a set of gleaming silver needles and several vials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at Colton and she instructed, &#34;Remove your shirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a curious tilt of his brow, Colton did as told,unfastening his buttons without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fabric slid away, his torso was exposed,revealing a strange pattern of dark bruises radiating out from his left chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s gaze sharpened. The pattern had reached his heart, the severity catching her off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lie down,&#34; she instructed tersely, lighting an alcohol lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton followed her instructions, settling onto the treatment bed as she began sanitizing the needles over a softly glowing alcohol lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although her hands looked delicate, every movement was precise and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to feel this,&#34; she cautioned, guiding the first needle with deliberate care to a spot just above his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s body reacted at once, muscles tensing beneath his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain roared through him, blazing beneath his skin as if a live wire had touched his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace worked without stopping, her hands deft as she placed seven more needles in quick succession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s brow glistened with sweat, but by the time she pressed in the final needle, the relentless ache that had lived in his chest for months faded to a gentle whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The toxins have been locked away for now,&#34; said Grace, uncorking a tiny rival and shaking out a lustrous white pill. &#34;Take this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the pill and swallowed it with no second thoughts. The taste hit him hard, bitter than anything he had ever known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Byrd, I need a basin now,&#34; Grace said seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick wasted no time and brought the basin at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, Colton&#39;s stomach twisted, his throat most tightened, and he emptied a surge of blood into the waiting basin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood was ink-black and looked terrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every doctor in the room froze, eyes wide at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An alarming quantity of that dark fluid left Colton&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered a gentle assurance. &#34;You can relax. This process is called detoxification. There are still two sessions left before his system will be completely rid of toxins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Colton once the nausea subsided,leaving him feeling unexpectedly lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Dominick, she gave clear directions. &#34;Fetch some water so he can rinse his mouth, and take this packet of herbs. Have someone boil wvater, drop in the herbs, and let them simmer for about thirty minutes.He&#39;ll need to soak in a medicinal bath once it&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having seen Grace work her skills firsthand, Dominick had no doubts. He quickly did what she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, worry crept into his mnind. &#34;Is it normal for him to lose that much blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded with calm certainty, &#34;There&#39;s no need for concern. The more that comes out, the cleaner his blood will be. He might feel a little dizzy afterward, but I have pills to restore his strength. Just make sure he eats more nutritious food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In about thirty minutes, the bath was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the time had passed, Grace took out the needles and checked Colton&#39;s condition, noticing his pulse had grown stronger and steadier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an encouraging nod, Dominick said, &#34;I&#39;ll have the kitchen prepare nourishing meals for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just remember, moderation is important. Don&#39;t go overboard. He&#39;s already experiencing a decrease in sexual function. We need to take things slowly.&#34; Grace reminded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uncomfortable silence fell between them, neither Colton nor Dominick daring to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward tension settled in the room.</p>
