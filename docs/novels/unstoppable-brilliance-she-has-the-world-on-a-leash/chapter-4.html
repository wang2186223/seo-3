                <p>Energy sparkled in Julia&#39;s eyes as she squeezed Grace&#39;s hand. &#34;Take a look! Grace&#39;s eyes are just like mine when I was a girl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With uncontained excitement, she turned to her husband. &#34;Don&#39;t you think so,darling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s eyes flicked between his wife and Grace. The usual hardness in his expression faded, replaced by a rare softness. &#34;There&#39;s no denying it. They really do resemble each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was a mere coincidence, yet the likeness between Julia and Grace was uncanny from certain angles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both shared big eyes with a gentle tilt, matching noses, and jawlines that seemed cut from the same mold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia couldn&#39;t hide her delight as she said, &#34;We could pass for mother and daughter. Maybe this was always meant to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, a single meeting was all it took to know someone belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the start, Julia had taken a liking to Grace,feeling an instant bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others in the room, however, could hardly believe their ears. No blood ties connected them,yet Julia acted as if Grace were her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered by anyone else&#39;s opinion, Julia focused only on Grace, her words gentle. &#34;I promise to love you dearly. You are my cherished daughter now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel, sitting nearby, watched Grace&#39;s entrance with a critical gaze and a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Grace&#39;s plain clothing and simple background stood out like a sore thumb. The girl had grown up in an orphanage, moving from one family to another,and had missed out on a proper education.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The paperwork was finished. From that moment on,she belonged to the Holden family,&#34; Ethel said, her tone as cold as ice itself. &#34;Make sure that once she settles in, someone teaches her howN to behave. The standards in this family are not for just anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking the scorn that colored her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never agreed with this adoption. With Gianna already thriving-enrolled at a top school, always at the top of her class, and talented in the arts-what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was the point of bringing in a stranger with no background?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Ethel&#39;s objections, Grace had found her way into the house. She blamed Julia for clouding Rodger&#39;s judgment. Frustration churned in Ethel&#39;s chest, and a storm gathered on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t let this upset you, Grandma.&#34; Gianna came closer, her hand soft as she patted Ethel&#39;s back.Her voice was sweet as she said, &#34;Grace is new here.We&#39;ll help her learn everything she needs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw Grace a glance filled with silent mockery,the hint of a smile curling at the edge of her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Grace stay calm, and seeing Julia fawn over her,made Gianna&#39;s blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had always spoiled her, buying every luxury and chasing down the latest fashion just to see her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Grace now in the picture, Gianna felt the sting of jealousy.Would Julia&#39;s love stretch that far, or was she herself about to lose her place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, you sure are awfully quiet tonight. Is there something wrong, or...&#34; Gianna let her words linger,dropping heavy hints that Grace might not even be able to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes shifted in Grace&#39;s direction, only then noticing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she had not said a single thing since her arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of contempt flickered in Gianna&#39;s gaze. She scoffed to herself, thinking Grace was probably stunned speechless by the grandeur around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any worries about Grace coming back to threaten her place in the family faded away-it seemed those fears had been for nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining steady, Grace lowered her eyes in a gesture of respect. &#34;I know my place. The elders are speaking,and I shouldn&#39;t interrupt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the family&#39;s back-and-forth felt like witnessing a play, so she found no space to join in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flashed across the room. None of them expected such a thoughtful response-perhaps there was more to her than they assumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s expression soured as shesilently fumed.Was that a subtle jab at her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Ethel&#39;s frosty exterior eased a touch. &#34;You know how to behave. That&#39;s good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the butler entered and announced, &#34;Dinner is served.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the whole family was settling in at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia made sure Grace took the seat right beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the meal, she paid special attention to her new daughter, serving her the tastiest dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Grace savor each bite, Gianna&#39;s envy spiked as she glanced at her own plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Months of dieting just to stay slim had left her hungry and irritable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Grace eat with such ease gnawed at her nerves,so she quickly shifted the conversation. &#34;Grace, I heard you dropped out of high school. What do you plan to do? Wanna continue school? I know people at Crestwood High. Maybe I can help you get in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crestwood&#39;s reputation wasn&#39;t exactly stellar-most students lacked motivation and ambition, content to coast through their classes without putting in any real effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing up Crestwood was nothing but a jab meant to put Grace in her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Grace could reply, Rodger spoke up. &#34;I already arranged for her to enroll at Briskvale High. She&#39;ll be starting next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire family froze at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s fake smile vanished, her eyes growing huge with shock. &#34;Briskvale High?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That school was legendary, reserved for the country&#39;s elite. Most families could only dream of sending their children there-how could someone from Grace&#39;s background possibly get in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to hide her jealousy, Gianna forced a smile and said, &#34;Uncle Rodger, Briskvale isn&#39;t just open to anyone. You need more than connections to get accepted. Grace even dropped out of school, so how will that work?&#34;</p>
