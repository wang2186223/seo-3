                <p>Whispers and curious glances had swirled around for ages before a girl finally found the nerve to step up to Grace. &#34;Hey, Grace... where did you get that spot-fading skincare? Would you mind sharing the name?|saw how well it worked on Adrianna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace met the question directly. &#34;That&#39;s actually a homemade formula-a family secret. You won&#39;t find it on any store shelf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a blend she&#39;d invented herself, something she wasn&#39;t planning to share widely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of disappointment flashed across the girl&#39;s face, though she couldn&#39;t help herself from trying again. &#34;Well... could I maybe buy some from you?picked up way too many sunspots on my last trip,and nothing I tried seems to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Grace responded without hesitation,&#34;Sure,I can make you a jar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not expecting such an easy yes, the girl was left blinking, her prepared pitch suddenly unnecessary.Her surprise melted into a bright grin. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful! Just let me know the price and I&#39;ll send you the money right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this school, nearly every student either had deep pockets or a sharp mind, and most had both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draped in luxury brands, most of these students simply assumed that Grace&#39;s skincare must be both high-quality and within their budgets-everyone seemed eager to get their hands on a bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, count me in too! Could you make one for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking for something to help brighten my complexion and clear up some breakouts. Is there anything in your collection for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the group treated Grace as if she ran her own little beauty shop, crowding around with requests and wish lists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them realized that Grace&#39;s formulas were, in fact, Dr. Q&#39;s masterpieces-priceless creations in the world of skincare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Put up for auction, these products could easily rake in millions, far beyond what any typical student allowance could handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the spirit of friendship, Grace surprised her classmates. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about paying. We&#39;re al friends here, so these are on the house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her classmates received the offer as a gesture of goodwill-a thoughtful present rather than a transaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, a few wondered if they&#39;d misheard, but when Grace&#39;s words were confirmed, delight swept through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even those who had once kept their distance or harbored quiet doubts about Grace now found themselves warming up, drawn in by her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna couldn&#39;t help but notice the change,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>genuinely surprised at how easily the class atmosphere shifted to one of friendliness and acceptance-and she felt a quiet pride in the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no denying it: the beauty products Grace shared worked miracles, delivering results that other brands couldn&#39;t even promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within days of trying Grace&#39;s skincare, the girls in her class saw their reflections change-clearer,brighter,with not a single side effect to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was worlds apart from the store-bought brands,which too often left users with lingering problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for word to travel; soon, stories of the &#34;Grace effect&#34; were circulating through every hallway and lighting up the school&#39;s online forums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Previously, most of these girls blended into the background, never quite standing out for their looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some were blessed with good bone structure but plagued by stubborn skin; others had clear skin but forgettable features, while a handful had both but always seemed to fade from memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s gifts changed all that. Now, their complexions glowed, their personal style sharpened,and they walked with quiet self-assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna&#39;s transformation stood out the most. Once written off as the class&#39;s least attractive, she lost the dark mark on her face and emerged as a genuine beauty, drawing comparisons to Beatrice for charm and poise, though still falling a bit short of Gianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As friendships with Grace warmed, so did the girls&#39;willingness to listen. They eagerly followed her tips on clothing and hair, their appearances leveling up with each suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence followed. It showed in the way they moved, the way they laughed, the way they met the world directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace quickly found herself the center of attention,admired and adored by nearly everyone in her year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her positive influence didn&#39;t go unnoticed;classmates who benefited from her help cherished her all the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even students outside her class felt pangs of envy,wishing they could be close to Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the demand became too great to ignore. Through friends, classmates, or shy notes slipped into her hand, beauty-obsessed girls from all over campus started asking if there was any way to buy Grace&#39;s magical creations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning down a business opportunity wasn&#39;t in Grace&#39;s nature-she decided there was no reason not to profit from her talents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For students from other classes, though, her price tags weren&#39;t the generous deals she&#39;d given her classmates. Instead, she set rates that reflected the true value of her formulas-numbers more suited to luxury boutiques than school hallways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jaw-dropping prices left some girls reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sticker shock set in. Who could actually pay so much just for skincare?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few were desperate enough for flawless skin to scrape together the money, but most quickly gave up after hearing the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lizzie complained to anyone who&#39;d listen. &#34;That bumpkin Grace Miller claims she made those creams herself, but look at what she&#39;s charging! Six figures for a small jar-she might as well be robbing us in broad daylight.&#34; Secretly, she wanted nothing more than to get her hands on a jar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna, still smarting from her own recent failures,rolled her eyes and offered advice with forced indifference. &#34;She has always had a knack for scheming. Just let her be. You should focus on your grades and getting into a good university.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Terry&#39;s last visit, Gianna&#39;s usual self-assurance had all but vanished, replaced by a constant undercurrent of nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Ellie was watching her own career slip through her fingers. About all she could do was push Gianna to keep her head down and aim for the top universities in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, all the energy she&#39;d poured into Gianna would have been wasted.</p>
