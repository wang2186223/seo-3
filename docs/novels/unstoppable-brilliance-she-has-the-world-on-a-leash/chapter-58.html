                <p>For this occasion, Demi put her skills to the test,relying on the signature brewing method she&#39;d spent a small fortune mastering under a world-renowned barista.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Careful selection led her to her prized espresso machine,every movement slowed for precision and effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her voice just enough to command attention,she displayed the beans with a flourish. &#34;This is Kopi Luwak,&#34; Demi declared. &#34;It&#39;s one of the rarest and most expensive coffees in the world. And Marvin managed to snag these just for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the society women, a few exchanged knowing looks, each understanding the rarity behind such beans. The engagement between Demi and Marvin was all but set in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle glance at Grace revealed her sitting quietly,which filled Demi with an unexpected rush of satisfaction. Did Grace feel outshone? Perhaps she&#39;d finally learned when to stay out of the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she poured, Demi made sure to slow her hand, the dazzling glint of her Patek Philippe watch drawing just</p>
                
                
                
                <p>as much attention as the ritual itself-a sparkling half -million dollar statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi continued in a velvety voice, &#34;In order to bring out the best...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,a decadent aroma wafted through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Polite nods rippled among the ladies, while Myla&#39;s expression shifted to one of clear approval. It was hard to deny that Demi&#39;s performance left a strong impression. Initially, her reservations about Demi&#39;s background lingered. The Miller family was nouveau riche, hardly a name with generations of standing,and she&#39;d feared that lack of pedigree would drag down the Dixon family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, recent days have proven Demi to be surprisingly accomplished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one graceful twist of her wrist, she&#39;d poured the coffee into Myla&#39;s cup. As she added the creamy froth,a beautiful pattern began to emerge. With a quick flick, she coaxed a flawless heart at the center,surrounded by delicate swirls that created an intricate floral design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Incredible! Just look at that art!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She really does have talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room buzzed with praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Grace, Myla smiled with a hint of challenge.&#34;Miss Miller, care to give it a try? I must caution you,though-these beans are extremely rare. A single mistake, and they&#39;re ruined...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dozens of eyes settled on Grace, waiting for her response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight frown creased Julia&#39;s brow at Myla&#39;s pointed remark. Why would Myla single out Grace in front of all these well-heeled guests? Among so many young women,choosing her own daughter as the center of attention felt oddly pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Julia&#39;s perspective, Myla&#39;s attitude bordered on outright hostility toward Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was supposed to be about exposure-Julia had only brought Grace to help her gain some experience in elite circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Julia had never once seen Grace prepare coffee,she leaned over and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t let her get to you.Just ignore whatever she says.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lighthearted laugh,Grace squeezed Julia&#39;s hand,then stood to face the challenge. &#34;I&#39;m certainly no professional,&#34; she announced warmly, &#34;so I&#39;ll use ordinary beans instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An incredulous smile threatened to break across</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ordinary beans, here? She could hardly wait to see Grace embarrass herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,moments later, the room slipped into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm confidence, Grace set out a handful of unremarkable beans. Her motions, however, were so fluid and practiced that even Demi&#39;s earlier display seemed forced by comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No fancy machines accompanied her, onlya simple French press stood on the table. Grace poured with a smooth finesse, and the hot water glided over the grounds,causing them to blossom and rise in flawless unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A breathtaking sight unfolded as she expertly poured frothed milk into the cup. With a graceful swirl, she created a base layer over the rich espresso,and then began to sculpt an adorable 3D bear. With precise movements, she shaped the head and ears, adding tiny white mounds for eyes and a small dot for the nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, a voice broke through the amazement. &#34;That&#39;s amazing! It&#39;s 3D latte art.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An elderly man with silver hair entered at a measured pace, an attendant trailing behind with an elegant case in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excited whispers rippled through the crowd. &#34;It&#39;s Elliot Natt-the Coffee Legend himself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the world of coffee,few names carried more weight than Elliot&#39;s. Public sightings were rare, making this appearance something of a myth come true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lois could hardly contain her joy. To have Elliot join their gathering felt like a rare privilege, something far beyond what she had hoped for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had sent out invitation after invitation, each one filled with the hope that the maestro would finally agree. She longed for him to bring his brilliance into their midst, to lift their gatherings into something far more refined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elliot always had too much on his plate, and there was never a moment he could spare to show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of him walking in, unannounced and unhurried, stirred a rush of delight-it was the kind of surprise no one saw coming, yet everyone welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What an honor, Mr. Natt! Welcome!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elliot offered a warm nod to the assembled guests,his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>searching gaze finally settling on Grace. Recognition sparked instantly in his eyes. &#34;Young lady! I haven&#39;t forgotten your artistry, the 3D latte art you showed last time is still vivid in my mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A collective gasp swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Springing to her feet, Grace offered a polite greeting.&#34;Good afternoon,Mr.Natt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hearty laugh bubbled from Elliot as he turned and told everyone, &#34;Let me tell you, her skill with coffee could humble even a veteran like myself. I even brought my antique espresso set, hoping we might convince her to share another demonstration with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of disbelief rippled across the room. Such quiet brilliance from Grace had caught everyone off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity soon won out, and guests crowded forward to sample the brew she&#39;d just made, eager to see if the taste matched Elliot&#39;s glowing endorsement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One sip was all it took; praise began to circulate, soft and awed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time,even Myla found herself conceding.Those humble beans, transformed by Grace&#39;s hand,held an intensity and bouquet that far surpassed even the celebrated Kopi Luwak. What Grace achieved bordered on miraculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation flickered across Myla&#39;s features. The revelation that Julia&#39;s adopted daughter, this quiet,unusual girl, possessed such extraordinary talent was hard to stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Demi lingered off to the side, her complexion ashen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her well-rehearsed techniques and expensive training felt suddenly amateurish-almost laughable next to Grace&#39;s effortless command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What unsettled Demi even more was witnessing the easy rapport between Grace and Elliot, the undisputed luminary of their coffee-loving world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where could they have crossed paths? Wasn&#39;t Grace supposed to be an adopted child with no particular ties or privileges? How had she managed to develop such refined skills?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Julia looked at Grace, her heart swelling with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each day, her remarkable daughter managed to surprise her all over again.</p>
