                <p>A look of disbelief washed over Anthony. &#34;We all saw Grace Miller work through the test ourselves. That should rule out any idea of cheating, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his words, uncertainty tugged at the back of his mind. It was hard to ignore-finishing such a challenging test so quickly seemed almost impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Baldwin, what if she already knew the questions?Anyone could have told her about the questions beforehand. It&#39;s hardly a state secret. Either way, we can&#39;t let someone with questionable behavior join the honors class,&#34; Ellie said, making her disapproval plain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An awkward tension settled over the room. Anthony found himself stuck, reluctant to let Grace affect the honors class&#39;s reputation, but aware this placement had come from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Ellie holding her ground, Anthony turned toward Grace for guidance. &#34;Grace Miller, perhaps the honors class isn&#39;t the right fit for you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave him a steady look and answered without a hint of worry, &#34;That&#39;s fine with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief broke across Anthony&#39;s face, and he wasted no</p>
                
                
                
                <p>time in calling for three more teachers to join them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an encouraging tone, he introduced her.&#34;Everyone, this is Grace Miller. She&#39;ll be joining a senior class starting today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie didn&#39;t wait for him to finish. She shot a glare at Grace&#39;s way. &#34;She&#39;s the prodigy who managed to ace a science exam in just fifteen minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing off to one side, Grace kept her head bowed,her expression hidden from view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle meaning in Ellie&#39;s words was not lost on the other teachers. Their gazes flickered to Grace,full of silent questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody said anything for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re glad to have you, Grace.&#34; Finally, Fred Anderson broke the silence. He was easily the oldest teacher there, approaching fifty, and had spent most of his life working at this school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, though, the students seemed less and less interested in his classes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention back to Grace, Anthony asked quietly, &#34;Are you absolutely sure this arrangement works for you, Grace Miller?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was mindful of her family&#39;s generous donation and</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the original promise of a spot in the honors class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I&#39;m fine with the arrangement,&#34; Grace replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A weight seemed to lift from Anthony&#39;s shoulders.&#34;Perfect. Mr. Anderson, would you show her to her new class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much delay, Fred guided Grace down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Age had slowed his steps, so Grace matched his measured pace with quiet respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they walked, Fred took in her appearance-a neatly pressed uniform and an air of quiet discipline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been interrupted mid-lesson, and the sound of his students&#39; laughter and chatter echoed down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Fred entered the classroom with Grace, the students&#39; rowdiness faded to a hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to address the class, Fred announced,&#34;Class,this is Grace Miller. She&#39;ll be joining us from today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly,the room filled with murmurs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s really pretty, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Word is, her grades were awful, and her family bought her a spot here. No way she&#39;d getin otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another spoiled rich kid, I bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t she from the Holden family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered her introduction, voice steady. &#34;Hello,I&#39;m Grace Miller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair, drawn back in a ponytail, added a laid-back energy. The slight curve of her lips hinted at a smile,but her gaze remained unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin was flawless, smooth as porcelain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s gorgeous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She could easily outshine the prom queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We might have a new queen now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the classroom, Fred gave a nod. &#34;Grace,there&#39;s a seat open next to Adrianna. You can sit there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s gesture guided Grace toward a seat near Adrianna Walsh-a girl with neat braids and a gentle smile, though a small dark mark marred her otherwise cheerful face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Grace walked across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a boy tried to trip her by sticking out his foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, a sharp crack filled the air, and his face went sheet-white as he grabbed his foot, crying out,&#34;Ouch! My foot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wide-eyed innocence, Grace looked at him.&#34;Did you hurt yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, she pretended to help him up,her voice barely a whisper as she murmured, &#34;Try that again, and next time it&#39;ll be worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear flickered in his eyes. He looked up at her as though he had glimpsed something chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred rushed over, concern etched on his face. &#34;Bruce,are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrinking into his seat, Bruce Douglas stammered, &#34;It&#39;s nothing...&#34; Too mortified to confess, he avoided everyone&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, Grace took her place by Adrianna and pulled a textbook from her backpack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a shy motion, Adrianna slid a folded note onto Grace&#39;s desk. Inside, the words warned, &#34;Watch out for Bruce. He&#39;s a bully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the message brought a small smile to Grace&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up her pen and responded, &#34;Thanks for the heads up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next line she wrote suddenly turned sharp. &#34;It&#39;s hard to tell who should be worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the back door slammed open with a noisy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall boy strode in, blazer slung carelessly over his shoulder and a mischievous grin already in place. &#34;Fred,what&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown creased Fred&#39;s brow. &#34;Charles Pearson,this is getting old. You&#39;re late again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversation in the classroom faded instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her gaze, Grace found herself locking eyes with Charles-there was something familiar and piercing about his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is Grace Miller, your new classmate,&#34; Fred introduced. &#34;Since you&#39;re the class president, I&#39;d like you to help her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow arch of his brow, Charles Pearson studied Grace before flashing an easy smile. &#34;Happy to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just say the word.&#34;</p>
