                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not the case at all. Johnny never paid my way. Scholarships and working part-time kept me afloat. My parents are not destitute, either. It&#39;s not like people are saying,&#34; said Beatrice, her tone firm but steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in a million years would she confess to scheming for money from her sugar daddies,or that her family leaned on her to make ends meet. And letting the Holden family see her as some desperate girl chasing after a rich heir was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Full scholarships don&#39;t just fall from the sky,&#34; replied Grace, not missing a beat. &#34;Unless you rank in the top three, it&#39;s nearly impossible. If memory serves,you never even cracked the top ten.&#34; Grace wasn&#39;t about to let her off the hook and ruthlessly refuted her claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping in as Beatrice&#39;s champion, Gianna spoke with confidence. &#34;Grace, you&#39;re still new here.Beatrice used to be one of the top three students.She&#39;s always worked hard, and her parents have respectable jobs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Experience told Gianna that neither Ethel nor Julia would bother checking the details, so she helped uphold the lie and keep things calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she didn&#39;t see any harm in Johnny and Beatrice being tangled up together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of her hoped Johnny wouldn&#39;t find someone with brighter prospects-he had never paid her special attention, no matter how she tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, he had a knack for speaking harshly to her, and the thought of him living happily grated on her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Gianna&#39;s intervention, Ethel accepted the explanation and decided it wasn&#39;t worth probing further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, the butler entered with a steaming pot of coffee. Hoping to make a good impression on Ethel, Beatrice hurried forward and offered to pour her a cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories about Ethel&#39;s enduring grip on the Holden Group had made their way to Beatrice, courtesy of Gianna. Even after stepping away from the business due to her health, Ethel&#39;s word still carried weight throughout the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Holden, Gianna mentioned how much you appreciate a cup of hot coffee. Please, let me serve you a fresh one,&#34; remarked Beatrice, her hands busy with the coffee set. She couldn&#39;t help but notice Grace standing quietly at her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly idea took root in Beatrice&#39;s mind almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan changed the instant her fingers wrapped around the cup. Instead of passing it to Ethel, she plotted to let the scalding liquidspill onto her own skin, making sure it happened away from prying eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intention was to act the victim and point the  finger at Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for her, Grace had been paying close attention, always ready for any schemes Beatrice might cook up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single move slipped past her watchful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Beatrice moved to set her plan in motion,Grace deftly intercepted the cup and, where no one else was watching, deliberately tipped the hot coffee onto her own hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp cry escaped her lips. &#34;Ow, that&#39;s burning hot!&#34; exclaimed Grace, her eyes brimming with tears she fought to hold back, then with trembling accusation, she turned to Beatrice.&#34;Why would you do that to me, Beatrice? I simply mentioned your background? Why the hostility?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had never struggled with a performance-making accusations was practically second nature,and she played the part flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as her final word left her lips, everyone in the room shifted their focus to her, and at that perfect moment, tears spilled down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no, Grace, what happened? Are you hurt?!&#34;Julia&#39;s voice rang out in alarm. The sight of Grace&#39;s red,scalded hand, along with her sorrowful tears, left her heart aching with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had always been her pride-a gentle,thoughtful child who almost never let her feelings spill over, let alone cry. Watching her daughter now,full of pain and brimming with injustice, left Julia&#39;s calm heart twisting in anguish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you thinking? Grace barely rebuked you,and yet you went so far as to pour hot coffee on her?At your age, to harbor such spite shows something is deeply wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scheme unraveling before her eyes left Beatrice speechless. Never had she expected Grace to flip the script and use her very own trick against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessness settled in, and she could hardly stand it. &#34;That&#39;s not true. I swear I didn&#39;t do it! She poured it on herself!&#34; she explained, desperation leaking into every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility of Julia becoming her mother-in-law one day was never far from Beatrice&#39;s mind. No matter her frustrations, she couldn&#39;t afford to antagonize Julia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace isn&#39;t unreasonable. There&#39;s no way she&#39;d burn herself on purpose,&#34; retorted Julia, her tone cold and final. &#34;You&#39;ve hurt my daughter and now you&#39;re lying about it. Please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Julia&#39;s protective side surfaced so fiercely that she ordered a guest out without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, she called the butler to fetch the first-aid kit and leaned over Grace, her words full of concern.&#34;Does it sting badly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Mom, there&#39;s no need to worry. It doesn&#39;t hurt much at all. I have burn ointment in my room, so I&#39;ll be back to normal soon.&#34; Grace hoped to put her mother at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worrying her mom wasn&#39;t on the agenda. She&#39;d made sure before acting that the coffee was only comfortably warm-not hot enough to leave any marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s self-preservation instincts would never allow her to risk real pain. No one knew that better than Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe this was just an accident. Beatrice could have bumped Grace by mistake, and the coffee went flying. Aunt Julia, try not to be too upset,&#34; Gianna interjected, although her patience with Beatrice&#39;s blunders was wearing thin, especially since they shared the same precarious position.</p>
