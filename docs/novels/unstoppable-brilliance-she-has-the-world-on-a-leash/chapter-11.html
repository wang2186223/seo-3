                <p>Colten&#39;s long fingers tapped rhythmically against the car window, an icy tension radiating from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, is something the matter?&#34; Dominick asked from the front passenger seat, picking up on the shift in atmosphere and quickly glancing back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colten&#39;s eyes were calm but blank. &#34;Any updates on that investigation I assigned you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pulse of unease shot through Dominick. Beads of sweat formed along his brow. &#34;I&#39;m still digging, but it&#39;s odd...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then forced himself to continue, &#34;The security footage from that spot looks like it was deliberately altered. It&#39;s nothing but static now. We haven&#39;t been able to recover anything useful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Colten raised an eyebrow, a sharp look flickering through his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he slowly straightened his cufflinks, he said in a low,dangerous voice, &#34;And this happened in a residential zone under constant surveillance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat had already soaked through the back of Dominick&#39;s shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colten let out a quiet chuckle just then, his eyes landing on to the spot where Grace had stood outside the window. &#34;Drop the investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick hesitated. &#34;You mean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was the young lady from earlier.&#34; A faint smirk curved Colten&#39;s lips. &#34;She&#39;s got some impressive reflexes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She? The same one who outbid us on the foxglove?&#34;Dominick echoed in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly remembered the moment Grace-slight and elegant-took down a few grown men with startling speed. &#34;Who is she really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look into her,&#34; Colten ordered. Something about her didn&#39;t sit right with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34; With her face now familiar to Dominick,tracking her down would be a lot simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After securing the rare foxglove, Grace rushed home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace!&#34; Julia hurried toward her, hands trembling as she grabbed hold of Grace&#39;s shoulders. &#34;What took you so long to get home? I was this close to sending</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James out to find you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace felt a rush of warmth tinged with guilt. She bit her lower lip softly, blaming the delay on those thugs.She should have kicked a few of them harder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly masked her thoughts with a bright smile.&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mom. Something came up while I was on my way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny lounged lazily against the staircase railing,mischief written all over his striking face. &#34;Mom, she&#39;s not a toddler. You&#39;re making a fuss over nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the times he and James disappeared for days without stirring this much concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just don&#39;t get it!&#34; Julia snapped at him, then softened immediately, brushing her fingers through Grace&#39;s hair. &#34;Grace is beautiful and kind. There are dangerous people out there...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny rolled his eyes, the corner of his mouth twitching.He couldn&#39;t figure out what kind of magic Grace had worked on their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, school would be a different world. One where Julia wouldn&#39;t be there to shield her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At exactly eight the next morning, a sleek black</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybach pulled up in front of the towering gates of Briskvale High.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia gently straightened Grace&#39;s already-perfect uniform and adjusted her tie with care. &#34;Don&#39;t stress,sweetheart. Your dad already talked to the admissions director. You, Gianna, and Johnny have all been placed in the same class. If something confuses you,just ask them. And if anyone gives you trouble,you call me right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace nodded, her hair fluttering slightly in the morning breeze. &#34;Got it, Mom. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and one more thing-&#34;&#39;Julia leaned in,lowering her voice. &#34;I tucked some money into the inner pocket of your backpack. Use it on anything you need.Don&#39;t ever go without.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. I&#39;ll give school my best,&#34; Grace replied.Honestly, studying felt like the easiest thing in the world to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia sighed, gently cupping Grace&#39;s cheeks. &#34;Your grades don&#39;t matter to me. I&#39;m only interested in your happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she took in Grace&#39;s composed figure in her school uniform, her chest tightened unexpectedly. &#34;We&#39;ve only just started living together, and now you&#39;re heading off... I&#39;m already missing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger,familiar with Julia&#39;s sentimental side, stepped in with a chuckle. &#34;She&#39;s only going to school, not disappearing. She&#39;ll be back home after class; you&#39;ll survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s still several hours... What if she doesn&#39;t adjust to the new environment? It makes me nervous,&#34; Julia murmured,looking worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny, seated close by, rolled his eyes. &#34;If we don&#39;t head in now, we&#39;ll be late. And showing up late on the first day? That&#39;s asking for trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia glared at him. &#34;Look after your sister at school.Focus on your studies, or your dad will straighten you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s lips twitched in silent protest. Such blatant double standards! Absolutely shameless favoritism!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had just told Grace that grades didn&#39;t matter,only happiness did. But when it came to him?Different rules entirely!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes he really questioned whether he was even Julia&#39;s biological son, despite her constant reassurances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he wasn&#39;t foolish enough to talk back,especially with Rodger standing right there. If he annoyed Julia,Rodger, who adored her dearly, wouldn&#39;t spare him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wise man knew when to stay quiet, so Johnny decided to keep his mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger checked the time and gently guided Julia back toward the car. He glanced over his shoulder at Johnny and Grace. &#34;Alright, you two head in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two made their way toward the school gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia stood still, watching Grace disappear into the crowd, a touch of sadness in her eyes. &#34;Do you think she&#39;ll be okay? Maybe I should pick her up early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger placed a hand on her shoulder. &#34;She needs to handle things herself. That&#39;s how she&#39;ll grow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he led her away.</p>
