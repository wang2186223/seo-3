                <p>Throughout the remainder of the lesson, an unusual hush settled over the classroom as eyes kept drifting toward the window-side desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace,propping her chin with one hand, seemed lost in thought, her attention fixed outside, completely unfazed by the surreptitious stares darting her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the dismissal bell chimed, students clustered around, vying for a better look ather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That must be the new girl,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, I think she might even outshine Gianna White!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,lower your voice...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Gianna sat absorbed in her reading,apparently untouched by the buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her striking looks, she&#39;d long been the campus darling,crowned prom queen of Briskvale High and holding a key position in the student union-her popularity practically legendary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet was broken by Lizzie Watson bursting</p>
                
                
                
                <p>through the door, taking the seat directly in front of Gianna. &#34;Gianna, have you heard? Everyone&#39;s talking about Grace Miller-the transfer! They&#39;re saying she&#39;s even prettier than you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s hand froze on her page for just a second.Rodger had succeeded in pulling strings to get Grace enrolled here. Relief flickered through her-at least Grace hadn&#39;t landed in her class. Still, for someone who&#39;d always worn the crown, the prospect of Grace outshining her was a bitter pill to swallow.There was no way she&#39;d stand by and let Grace get ahead of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing her lips together, she spoke in a gentle,almost patronizing tone. &#34;Lizzie, don&#39;t take it so hard.The transfer student everyone&#39;s talking about? She&#39;s actually my Uncle Rodger&#39;s adopted daughter. Her childhood was rough-she bounced between foster homes and orphanages. She&#39;s no academic standout either. My uncle pulled every string to get her into here. Now that she&#39;s here, we ought to be welcoming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she could barely contain the flare of resentment heating her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just too nice, Gianna,&#34; Lizzie replied, rolling her eyes in disbelief. &#34;I went to see her myself-she&#39;s nothing special. Those rumors are way overblown.She only made it here because of connections. Bet she won&#39;t last long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Colton stepped from the bathroom,steam trailing behind and a towel thrown loosely over his shoulders, damp hair dripping down his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found Dominick standing ready, the dutiful assistant as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve done some digging, sir,&#34; Dominick said. &#34;The girl you wanted information on is Grace Miller. She&#39;s just been adopted by the Holden family and spent her early years in an orphanage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight furrow appeared between Colton&#39;s brows.&#34;That&#39;s all you&#39;ve found? Nothing else of note?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unshakable suspicion gnawed at Colton-there had to be more to Grace than met the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve only managed surface details so far. Every time we try to push past the basics, the trail just goes cold,&#34; Dominick explained, frustration evident in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a scenario was unprecedented for him. With all their resources and expert investigators, they&#39;d barely scratched the surface of Grace&#39;s background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin, cold smile played at Colton&#39;s lips. &#34;Don&#39;t stop -keep digging. Any word on Dr. Q?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That lead was just as urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick shook his head. &#34;No progress yet. Dr. Q remains impossible to trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Raise the bounty again,&#34; Colton instructed,his voice crisp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the final bell rang, signaling the end of the school day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace quietly packed up her books and slipped out of the classroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had reached out, offering her a ride home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Grace politely refused, knowing the after-school rush would clog the streets, she figured hailing a cab would be much simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia finally conceded, offering one last reminder for Grace to be careful before bustling off to whip up dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted nothing more than to spoil her daughter with a delicious home-cooked feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace hadn&#39;t made it far from the gate when her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>phone began to buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s enthusiastic voice came through the line. &#34;I&#39;m right outside your school-just say the word and I&#39;ll drive you home!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stomach rumbling, Grace didn&#39;t hesitate to accept his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, she easily picked out Patrick&#39;s car parked curbside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A Mercedes this shiny and ostentatious couldn&#39;t help but attract curious looks from passing students and parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing a sigh, Grace made her way over, fighting the urge to roll her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window slid down at a leisurely pace, and Patrick greeted her with a grin that was far too eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over here!&#34; he called out, hopping out to swing the passenger door open. &#34;I figured you&#39;d appreciate a VIP pick-up today. How&#39;s that for service?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace slipped into the seat, dropping her backpack behind her. With a sideways glance, she lowered her voice. &#34;Trying to announce to the whole school you know me? This car&#39;s flashy enough to stop traffic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Patrick laughed and pulled into traffic. &#34;I&#39;m</p>
                
                
                
                <p>just helping you make an entrance! Besides, in this city,cars like this barely turn heads...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave him a sidelong look. &#34;Try not to draw so much attention next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick raised a hand in mock surrender. &#34;Whatever you say.&#34; He shifted gears, then added, &#34;Hey, have you been getting enough sleep? Also, I&#39;m almost out of those pills you gave me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those pills were no ordinary supplements-they had a reputation for boosting vitality and extending life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Supply was notoriously tight. Only a couple ever made it onto the underground market each month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demand kept driving up the price, and every batch sparked fierce bidding wars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick never quite understood the fuss. On the surface, the pills looked unremarkable. Yet everyone seemed desperate to get their hands on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He figured it must come down to either the allure of scarcity or the endless games of the wealthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, on the other hand, treated the legendary pills as if they were nothing more than candies-she&#39;d casually pop one in her mouth whenever she felt like it.</p>
