                <p>On Saturday morning, just after sunrise, Julia brought Grace to the biggest shopping center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Julia stepped out of the car, she spotted Eliana arriving with Claire and Gianna close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana didn&#39;t seem to be in great shape. As they neared, Julia tilted her head slightly. &#34;Eliana,have you seen a doctor recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana blinked, caught off guard, then answered, &#34;I&#39;m alright, Julia. Probably just tired. Still, I&#39;ve booked a consultation with a specialist for Monday-just to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t originally intended to, but something in her chest didn&#39;t feel right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, Grace&#39;s confidence during their last encounter was impossible to overlook. So Eliana figured she&#39;d go, maybe pick up some medicine while she was at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s smart. So what brings you out today?&#34; Julia asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I&#39;d let the girIs choose some jewelry,&#34; Eliana replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia raised a brow-what a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire chimed in, clearly pleased with herself. &#34;Gianna scored second in the whole school on her exams, Aunt Julia. She definitely earned something special. That&#39;s why my mom brought us here. Are you jewelry shopping too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire had chosen her words carefully. She had heard whispers about Grace&#39;s background-that she was from an orphanage and had only gotten admitted to that school through favors, not merit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d never taken a liking to Grace, so her comment was meant to sting, to put Grace on edge in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s smile sharpened. &#34;Yes, Grace scored full marks this time, top of the entire school. I brought her here to celebrate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s grin vanished, and Gianna&#39;s expression went stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-What? You got a perfect score?&#34; Claire stammered,staring at Grace. &#34;How come? You&#39;re first, and Gianna&#39;s second?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace nodded with ease. &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana looked genuinely surprised. &#34;Julia, are you being serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia rested a hand on Grace&#39;s arm and spoke with ease. &#34;Why would I make something like that up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, Johnny had dodged the topic but didn&#39;t deny it, Julia took that as confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s fingers curled into tight fists, her nails pressing hard into her palms until they lost color. She managed a smile. &#34;It&#39;s true. Grace performed impressively this tme. I can&#39;t deny it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded with a mild, courteous smile.&#34;Thanks.Maybe it was just my good lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you probably just got lucky this once,&#34; Claire shot back, clearly annoyed. &#34;Next time, you&#39;ll probably be dead last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think so? Guess we&#39;ll find out,&#34; Grace said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since we&#39;re all here, why don&#39;t we go in together?&#34;Julia offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the boutique manager came out to welcome them personally. &#34;It&#39;s wonderful to see you guys. We have a special preview of our newest collection just for VIPs today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana nodded, her pride barely concealed. She turned to Claire and Gianna. &#34;Go ahead, pick out whatever you want. It&#39;s my treat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank you, Aunt Eliana.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia leaned toward Grace. &#34;Let&#39;s head up to the fifth floor afterward. They&#39;ve stocked some really nice pieces-fresh from the latest release. You&#39;ll get first pick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fifth floor housed Seraphic Jewelry, the most talked-about label in high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though only three years into the market, Seraphic Jewelry had built a name for itself with bold, elegant styles and unmatched detail, quickly becoming a status symbol among the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While not officially labeled a premier brand, its pricing matched the best of them. What truly set it apart,however, was its fiercely selective access, customers needed to spend over ten million and be referred by a senior client just to apply for membership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for Ultra VIP access? That was nearly mythical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were only a few Ultra VIPs in all of the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seraphic Jewelry&#39;s limited collections were notoriouisly hard to obtain-Eliana herself had waited three months just to secure a single piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Claire overheard Julia mention the fifth floor, her expression shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a smile, her grip tightening around her bag.&#34;Aren&#39;t Seraphic Jewelry&#39;s latest pieces only available by appointment? Aunt Julia, do you have access?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s smile was composed. &#34;I&#39;m one of their Ultra VIPs. They reached out yesterday to let me know some new arrivals had come in. I thought it&#39;d be the perfect time to bring Grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of envy passed through Gianna&#39;s eyes, but she quickly masked it.&#34;Grace, you&#39;re really lucky to have such a caring mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave her a cool glance, saying nothing in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia beamed.-&#34;She&#39;s my daughter. Of course I want to give her the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she and Grace made their way to the top floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the upper circles understood-access to the fifth floor marked a shift in class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fewer than a hundred people had clearance, and only two guests were allowed entry at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Julia escort Grace up, Eliana&#39;s smile faltered for a second.Beside her, Gianna fumed silently.Why?was Grace the one getting special treatment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Se swallowed the bitterness and turned to Eliana.&#34;Do you think Aunt Julia doesn&#39;t like me anymore? She used to treat me so warmly, but ever since Grace showed up, something feels different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana huffed, clearly displeased. &#34;Julia&#39;s just too taken with that girl. Don&#39;t let it bother you. You&#39;re outstanding, and none of this is your fault. Comne,let&#39;s havea look around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, Gianna. Don&#39;t feel bad. You&#39;re amazing, and if others can&#39;t see it, that&#39;s on them,&#34;Claire supported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s shoulders relaxed a little. &#34;I really am lucky to have you both.&#34;</p>
