                <p>Grace fixed the shopkeeper with an unflinching stare,her fingers drumming a rhythmic, deliberate beat on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bead of sweat traced down the man&#39;s face as he ventureda worriedglance towardDominick.&#34;Mr.Byrd...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The promise of fortune that came with the foxglove,had completely evaporated. At this rate, survival seemed like the best outcome he could hope for.Nothing in his years running the stall had left him in such a bind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick regarded Grace with cool detachment.&#34;Not everything in this world can be bought. If Mr. Pearson wants something,he gets it-simple as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved, Grace let a cold smirk tug at her lips. &#34;Is that so? Then let&#39;s put that to the test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smooth motion, she lifted her hand and idly tapped her black card against the surface. &#34;Thirty million,&#34; she said,voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the absolute ceiling she&#39;d set for herself. If she hadn&#39;t encountered this annoying man, she wouldn&#39;t have had to inflate a five-million purchase to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thirty million. This was madness, pure and simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t bluffing-if the bidding climbed higher,she was ready to settle things a different way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of curiosity sparked within her. She genuinely wondered what sort of fool with too much money was behind this man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, silence swept through the shop.The shopkeeper&#39;s legs gave out and he nearly collapsed,barely holding himself upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of disbelief swept over Dominick&#39;s face-Grace&#39;s resolve had caught him completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, up in the private suite, Colton&#39;s lazy sprawl paused, the spark of intrigue glinting in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s taken it up to thirty million,&#34; Dominick said through the earpiece, edged with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s reply was smooth, a shade more interested than before. &#34;Fascinating. Find out who she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d had his eye on the rare foxglove, hoping it might ease his condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the tales of its near-miraculous detoxifying powers,he suspected the plant was more a balm for the mind than a true cure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by the woman&#39;s persistence, it clearly meant a great deal to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, Colton let his eyes fall, then an amused chuckle slipped from his lips. &#34;Let her win it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick hesitated, concern creeping into his voice.&#34;But sir-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s irrelevant. It&#39;d only go to waste with me,&#34; Colton replied, a note of dry humor in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was stark: without Dr. Q&#39;s intervention, he doubted he&#39;d see another season change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, his health had been in steady decline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the sofa, Colton called to his men. &#34;We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace grew impatient at the silence and rapped her knuckles against the counter, fixing the shopkeeper with a glare. &#34;Well? Are you in business or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shopkeeper, ashen and shaking, darted a nervous glance toward Dominick for direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Powerless to influence the outcome, he could only react as the scene unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through his earpiece, Dominick absorbed Colton&#39;s decision, and his features twisted with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding out the words, he finally said, &#34;I&#39;m out. She can have it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Grace&#39;s face at the sudden capitulation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, she slid her card across the reader, pocketed the foxglove, and strode briskly out of the shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Grace left the shadows of the underground market than a handful of street thugs materialized, circling her with predatory grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors didn&#39;t stay buried long in these tunnels.Word had already spread-someone just dropped tens of millions on a foxglove, and that someone was now a target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the men suggested, &#34;Hey there, gorgeous, it&#39;s getting late. Want a ride home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;Forget home-let&#39;s hit a bar. You look like you need to have some fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third added, &#34;Or maybe you&#39;d rather take a spin with me instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace blinked, her eyes darkening to cold steel.Looked like a few idiots had volunteered themselves for a lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A good fight was long overdue-she relished the opportunity to stretch her limbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll walk away right now,&#34; she warned, eyes flashing with cold intent, her voice low and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mocking laughter echoed back at her as the men exchanged grins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear that? She&#39;s telling us to scram!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s got spirit-l like that,&#34; another jeered,undeterred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of Grace&#39;s smooth skin and elegant frame only fueled their twisted desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, these men intended more than a simple mugging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smirk tugged at the corner of Grace&#39;s mouth.&#34;Apparently, you boys don&#39;t understand a direct warning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the almost playful tone, there was a razor&#39;s edge in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swaggering forward, the ringleader reached for her cheek. &#34;You&#39;re a wildcat, huh? That just makes you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His taunt was cut short as Grace snatched his wrist,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spun, and hurled him over her shoulder with ruthless efficiency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp yelp escaped him as he crashed to the pavement, instantly curled into a heap of agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for shock to wear off, Grace slipped between the others like a shadow, her movements swift,precise,and merciless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next target caught a spinning kick square in the chest, and the force sent him tumbling ten feet back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her, now! I&#39;ll make sure she regrets this,&#34; shouted one of the thugs, flashing a knife as he lunged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a flicker of fear, Grace&#39;s eyes narrowed to cold slits. As the blade darted toward her,she twisted aside, delivering a sharp chop to his wvrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weapon clattered across the pavement, followed immediately by her brutal elbow slamming into his ribs -he dropped to his knees, coughing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took less than a minute for the entire gang to hit the ground, writhing and groaning in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace brushed her hands together, as if ridding them of crumbs, and shot the fallen men a glare colder than midnight. &#34;Have you learned your lesson-or do you need more encouragement?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear took over their bluster; they stammered apologies, all pretense gone. &#34;We&#39;re sorry-we had no idea you were this tough. Please, we won&#39;t cross you again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on their ashen, trembling faces.&#34;Move along. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick adjustment of her clothes, she stood taller, her confidence radiating like a force field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run! Move it!&#34; The battered men scrambled to their feet and took off, stumbling over each other in their haste to disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Colton-watching the entire exchange from a distance-was left speechless, recognition dawning as he realized just who she was.</p>
