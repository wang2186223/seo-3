                <p>Grace entered the grand hall alongside Julia,immediately feeling the cold,judging stare from Ethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of you, get down on your knees now!&#34; shouted Ethel, her voice edged sharply with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia opened her mouth to reply, but Grace gently took her mother&#39;s hand and stepped forward with quiet confidence. &#34;Grandma, could you tell me exactly whatI&#39;ve done to upset you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief glance toward Gianna&#39;s self-satisfied face confirmed Grace&#39;s suspicions-another twisted tale must have reached Ethel&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still dare to ask me?&#34; Ethel asked,pointing directly at Gianna. &#34;You openly humiliated her in front of everyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s eyes fell on Gianna&#39;s reddened face, and she gave a knowing smile. &#34;Oh, you&#39;re referring to the bet,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved closer to Gianna, lowering her voice to a whisper. &#34;Did you conveniently forget who suggested that bet first, and who-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this nonsense immediately!&#34; Ethel&#39;s stern voice sliced through Grace&#39;s words. &#34;Publicly embarrassing Gianna was unacceptable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s brows knitted softly as she turned to Gianna.&#34;Tell me honestly,Gianna.Did Grace force your hand?Everyone saw what truly happened. How could you twist things like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment colored every word Julia spoke.Gianna had always been a lovely and kind girl in Julia&#39;s memory. She adored Gianna&#39;s sweetness, showering her with endless gifts and affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Grace arrived, Julia&#39;s warmth toward Gianna remained unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it caught her completely off guard that Gianna would twist the truth so boldly about what really went down at the Aurora Gem Fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s cheeks drained of color as she stammered,unable to meet Julia&#39;s gaze. &#34;Aunt Julia, I-I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped her eyes, guilt evident in every shifting glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel said coldly, &#34;Julia,stop blindly defending Grace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia smiled softly, her tone gentle yet firm. &#34;I&#39;m not</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blindly defending anyone. Everything has to be judged fairly.If Grace truly mistreated Gianna, I would step in.But I won&#39;t let Gianna twist the truth to harm Grace,either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>EtheI&#39;s frown deepened, her gaze shifting uncertainly between Gianna&#39;s guilty look and Grace&#39;s steady calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization gradually dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing a hand to her temple, Ethel said with a strained voice, &#34;Fine. Since that&#39;s settled, you all should go now. I have a headache and need rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia and Grace respectfully withdrew, nodding politely as they exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had come to realize that whenever she spent time with Ethel, their conversations always left Ethel nursing a headache. Maybe the truth was that the two of them simply didn&#39;t mix welL. Maybe she should limit her visits, for everyone&#39;s peace of mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,Julia glanced at Grace with concern. &#34;Are you upset,Grace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace shook her head gently. &#34;I&#39;m fine. It just bothers me that you&#39;re dragged into these conflicts because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered silently if she somehow attracted</p>
                
                
                
                <p>women with dishonesty and manipulation wherever she went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia laughed lightly, her eyes kind. &#34;It&#39;s nothing new to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d grown accustomed to Ethel&#39;s perpetual disapproval, unaffected by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia was sincere and trusting-perhaps too trusting,considering she still fell for Ethel&#39;s fake headaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Grace, there&#39;s a coffee party tomorrow,&#34; said Julia, shifting topics cheerfully. &#34;Come along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace nodded enthusiastically. &#34;Of course, Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third day, Grace slipped into a pale green dress chosen by Julia, highlighting her delicate features and graceful posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a pleased nod, Julia said, &#34;Grace, you&#39;re stunning today. There&#39;s no doubt you&#39;ll steal the spotlight at the event.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia herself wore an exquisite dark green dress adorned with floral embroidery, complemented perfectly by a strand of gleaming pearls, radiating elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linking arms with Grace affectionately, she teased lightly, &#34;Look at us matching today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event was an occasion for wealthy ladies like Julia to socialize and strengthen connections over coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the renowned Majestic Winery, a prestigious coffeehouse owned by Julia&#39;s close friend,Lois Ramirez, known for its sophistication and tranquil ambiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clusters of elegantly dressed ladies filled the space,sipping their drinks and murmuring in pleasant conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Grace and Julia entered, their presence immediately attracted attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Julia, you&#39;ve finally arrived!&#34; Lois greeted warmly,linking arms with Julia and regarding Grace admiringly.&#34;And you must be Grace! You&#39;re even more charming in person than your photos suggest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded politely with a graceful nod, &#34;It&#39;s lovely to meet you, Mrs. Ramirez.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lois smiled brightly, leading them further into the venue. &#34;Come, let&#39;s introduce you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious whispers filled the room, acknowledging Grace&#39;s significance based on Lois&#39;s warm welcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice emerged from behind them,surprised yet intrigued. &#34;Myla! Good to see you.And who is this charming young woman you&#39;ve brought along?&#34;</p>
