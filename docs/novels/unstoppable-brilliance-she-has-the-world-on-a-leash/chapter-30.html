                <p>&#34;Sonia, what&#39;s going on?&#34; the man asked in a low,commanding tone, his sharp eyes scanning the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia immediately perked up, adopting a pitiful expression. &#34;Chris! You came just in time. This woman stole my bracelet and was caught in the act!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace arched an eyebrow when she heard this. No wonder the whole setup felt too perfect, and Sonia carried herself with such unwavering confidence. She had strong support behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The high-ranking officer, Chris Mendoza, was Sonia&#39;s cousin and a sergeant stationed at the local police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>is that so?&#34; Chris asked, his presence radiating authority. His manner was always quick on the draw and no-nonsense; crossing him was a dangerous game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The police officers instantly grew more serious when he entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chris continued, &#34;If that&#39;s the case, she must answer to the law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the officers and ordered, &#34;Take her in for Gianna felt a surge of satisfaction upon hearing those words. She couldn&#39;t help but wonder how Rodger and Julia would react when they discovered that their adopted daughter was a common thief. Grace might soon be cast out of the Holden family and possibly expelled from school as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought filled Gianna with joy. A scandal involving a Holden family member caught stealing would surely make headlines. And once that happened,Grace would no longer be a threat to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serious expression, a police officer turned to Grace and said, &#34;Please come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace lifted her eyes slightly, a subtle smile playing on her striking features. &#34;You are taking me in without confirming the truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are bringing you in for further investigation,&#34;the officer responded calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace remained composed. &#34;Have you really thought this through? If I go with you, the consequences won&#39;t be so simple. Even if you beg me to leave later, l won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia scowled. &#34;Have you lost your mind? Do you think the police station is your private playground, where you clock in and out at will? You have stolen something worth over a million dollars. Get ready to spend some serious time behind bars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding the situation dull, Grace pressed her lips together, clearly uninterested in continuing the act.She picked up her phone and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia sneered, &#34;Not even a miracle can save you now.You might as well accept your fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before long, several officers received calls asking whether they had arrested a woman named Grace Miller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After truthfully reporting the situation, the officers were met with a fierce reprimand and ordered to release her at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to waste another minute, Grace said, &#34;I&#39;m not a thief. Even if you handed me that diamond bracelet, I wouldn&#39;t want it, let alone steal it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop pretending. You are only saying that because you can&#39;t have it!&#34; Sonia snapped, her face twisted with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of influence did Grace actually hold? Those calls a moment ago had come directly/ from the police chief, demanding her immediate release. Chris looked at Grace with a hint of confusion, noting how calm and collected she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can prove I never laid a finger on that bracelet,&#34;Grace said firmly, her voice even and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prove it? Do you actually think we&#39;ll buy that?&#34; Sonia asked arrogantly. Confident in what she believed was irrefutable evidence, she was sure Grace would still end up in jail. So what if she had connections? Under the law, everyone was supposed to be treated equally.To most, Grace&#39;s phone call seemed like a desperate last resort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered a calm, composed smile. &#34;Give me the diamond bracelet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the police handed it over to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace took the bracelet and turned to the attendant.&#34;Did you personally see me take this bracelet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant nodded without hesitation. &#34;Yes, I saw it clear as day, just like you are holding it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;Then I suggest you watch carefully this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment before slowly opening her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion spread through the crowd. Sonia scoffed,&#34;Stop with the tricks. Just admit you stole it, and maybe I&#39;ll ask for leniency on your behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Grace&#39;s delicate hand turned red, covered in nocence small,raised bumps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the room. &#34;What on earth is happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace calmly handed the bracelet back to the police and explained, &#34;The band of this diamond bracelet is made of platinum. I&#39;m allergic to it. As you can see, just touching it triggers a reaction. These red bumps will take at least a day to heal. That means there&#39;s no way l could have taken her bracelet earlier. I I had touched it before,my hand would have already shown symptoms.You all saw the reaction start the moment I touched it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allergic to platinum? Could it really be that coincidental? Sonia&#39;s face twisted in disbelief. &#34;No way! She must be faking it. This has to be some kind of trick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, everyone had clearly seen what Grace had done. There was no chance she could have pulled any tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chris&#39;s brow furrowed as he turned toward Sonia,trying to ease the rising tension. &#34;Sonia, is it possible you remembered things wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sonia was momentarily speechless, her eyes unconsciously shifting toward the attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace let out a cold laugh, then turned to the attendant, &#34;Since you were so sure I took the bracelet,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>explain exactly how you saw me do it. If you lie, I&#39;l make sure you&#39;re taken straight to the station.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicking, the attendant suddenly blurted out, &#34;I&#39;ll confess! Miss Richardson paid me fifty thousand to hide the bracelet in your purse...&#34;</p>
