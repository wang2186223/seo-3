                <p>Terry&#39;s words instantly delighted the three students he had mentioned, and even their teachers couldn&#39;t help but share in the moment of recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie had expected Gianna to catch Terry&#39;s attention,but Johnny being praised had taken her by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Johnny was in her class, he had always been more relaxed about academics. His grades lacked the consistency of Gianna&#39;s, and he certainly wasn&#39;t as obedient or eager to please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of this,Ellie had never intended to invest in him. Now that a student she had overlooked was suddenly singled out by Terry, her surprise was inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, despite her initial shock, a deeper sense of pride and satisfaction began to grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of her students had received praise from Terry.That could only improve her chances of earning a promotion this year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny, you&#39;re amazing! Congratulations on being praised by Prof. Warren!&#34; Beatrice said cheerfully,her bright smile lighting up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she wasn&#39;t in Johnny&#39;s class, her seat happened to be beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um, it&#39;s nothing, probably just luck,&#34; Johnny replied,caught off guard by the attention. The compliment from the girl he liked made him scratch his head shyly, a quiet joy blooming in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He usually spent his free time tinkering with computers and had even taught himself a bit of hacking. That hobby had sparked his interest in artificial intelligence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, the legendary leader of the International Hacker Alliance was his idol. Joining that elite group was more than a fantasy. It was a dream he quietly clung to. Driven by that dream, he had immersed  himself in early studies and secret research, hoping that one day, he might actually be worthy of joining that prestigious organization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny, you&#39;re so talented, yet you stay humble and quiet. I really admire that,&#34; Beatrice added,gazing at him with genuine admiration. She had a knack for choosing words that would make him feel special-and more devoted to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m flattered.&#34; Johnny&#39;s ears turned slightly red from her praise. A warm flush spread through him as he lowered his head, shy but happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Gianna sat near Terry in the front row,proudly holding her place as one of the student representatives. Hearing her name spoken by Terry filled her with pride. Still, she felt a twinge of resentment at having to share the spotlight. There was only one place at the top. And it should belong to her! Everyone else-Johnny, Beatrice-was nothing when compared to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast a deliberate glance toward Grace,who sat a short distance away, seemingly unfazed by the  recognition. She smirked and, feigning casual concern, said smugly, &#34;Grace, what a pity. Professor Warren didn&#39;t mention your name. You&#39;d better keep working hard, and don&#39;t let your parents down.Wouldn&#39;t want to disappoint them again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ll probably be disappointed forever. Some people just aren&#39;t meant to succeed, no matter how hard they try.&#34; Ellie, ever quick to gossip and proud of her judgment, chimed in with a biting remark when she overheard Gianna&#39;s jab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for them, their words failed to provoke Grace. As if she hadn&#39;t heard a thing, she remained calm, not sparing them even a glance. Not a flicker of emotion crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie had never met a student who dared ignore her so completely. When she was being sarcastic or outright scolding her students, they typically responded with either reverence or fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the silence? Do you think that perfect score was something you earned? Getting complacent already?&#34; Ellie snapped, her voice tinged with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She simply couldn&#39;t accept that Grace had achieved a perfect score on her own. In all her years of teaching, no student had ever done so-especially not a transfer with no decent academic performance.It just didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The SAT would eventually reveal the truth-there&#39;d be no room for tricks or shortcuts there. It would lay everything bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace finally turned to them, casually scratching her ear. &#34;I thought a dog was barking just now,&#34; she said flatly. &#34;Turns out it was just you talking. What were you saying again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words landed like a slap, and Ellie&#39;s and Gianna&#39;s expressions instantly darkened. A few student representatives stifled their laughter. They had long grown tired of Ellie&#39;s arrogance but never dared to speak up. Now, someone had finally said what they had only dared to think-and it was glorious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Ellie began, nearly shaking with rage, but some lingering sense of reason held her back. This wasn&#39;t the right place to explode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Terry&#39;s voice, charged with excitement,cut through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The articles published by the students I mentioned earlier were all excellent,&#34; he declared, his tone lively,&#34;but the most outstanding and impressive one is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, letting the suspense build, his eyes sweeping across the room in search of someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace Miller. Her insights on artificial intelligence were extraordinary-arguing not merely that Al replaces jobs, but that it propels the theory of surplus value into a quantum realm. This isn&#39;t just a scientific breakthrough; it&#39;s a clever critique of humanity&#39;s inflated sense of intellectual supremacy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry couldn&#39;t contain himself. His praise for Grace spilled out in a passionate torrent, each line more emphatic than the last. It was as though the entire academic world had been turned upside down by her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna and Ellie sat frozen, their minds blank with shock. Even Johnny looked dazed, eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace? His adopted sister? Could she really be this remarkable?</p>
