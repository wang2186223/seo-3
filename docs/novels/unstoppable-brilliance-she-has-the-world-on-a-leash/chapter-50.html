                <p>Johnny stopped in his tracks, a shadow falling across his face. &#34;Grace, what are you getting at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered with a careless shrug, &#34;You heard me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made no effort to clarify, already turning for the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny stepped in front of her, blocking her path.&#34;Explain yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flashed with a teasing glint. &#34;Didn&#39;t your beloved Beatrice mention where she was spending her day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at her, suspicion hardening his features.&#34;You saw her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied without emotion, &#34;Saw her cuddled up with some older guy. She looked pretty pleased about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a lie!&#34; Johnny shot back, his tone defensive.&#34;She&#39;s not like that, and I won&#39;t let you twist the truth.Stop trying to turn me against her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some truths cut deeper than any rumor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe whatever you want,&#34; Grace replied with a casual air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never imagined Johnny could be so blinded by affection. One day, the truth would hit him square in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>School came the next morning, and Johnny wasted no time hunting for Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She greeted him with the sweetness and shyness he adored. That was all the reassurance he needed. He convinced himself Beatrice would never do anything wrong.Grace must have been jealous, trying to poison him against the girl he liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, the third period brought with it a basketball game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna tugged Grace along, insisting they watch.Their walk down the corridor put them face-to-face with Beatrice and her friend, Chloe Robinson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Chloe turned her gaze on Grace and remarked, &#34;It&#39;s always the same-some people just have to flaunt their fake bags.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned as everyone noticed the striking resemblance between Grace&#39;s handbag and Beatrice&#39;s,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>though Grace&#39;s stood out with a golden triangular emblem gleaming on the front, giving it an extra touch of elegance. Beatrice&#39;s didn&#39;t have it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it didn&#39;t take long for rumors to spark-Grace&#39;s must be a cheap imitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Beatrice&#39;s handbag had been a present from Johnny himself. No one would ever believe he&#39;d buy anything but the real deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gossip followed Grace everywhere. Raised in an orphanage before joining the Holden household,she had never enjoyed the privileges others did. People thought it only logical she would settle for a fake,eager to keep up appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Adrianna, this was too much. &#34;Chloe,what&#39;s that supposed to mean? Who are you calling out for having a knock-off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe didn&#39;t miss a beat, rolling her eyes dramatically &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? Grace Miller&#39;s handbag looks just like Beatrice&#39;s. But Beatrice&#39;s came from Johnny Holden -why would hers be a fake? Tell me, how could Grace ever afford the real thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried through the hall, making sure as many students as possible overheard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna found the whole scene absurd. She knew full well that Grace had more taste-and means-than any</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of them suspected. Grace&#39;s handbag was actually finer and looked far more high-end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while,Beatrice hung back, lowering her gaze and saying softly, &#34;Chloe, stop... Maybe Grace really just likes this design, and that&#39;s why she...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was sweet, but every word poured fuel on the fire, leaving everyone convinced Grace&#39;s handbag was a cheap knock-off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna bristled, her cheeks flushed with anger.&#34;You&#39;re all unbelievable...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shamelessness on display was almost too much to take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gently reached out to stop Adrianna, her smile never faltering. &#34;Actually, I bought this from the brand&#39;s official store. It&#39;s genuine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe retorted instantly, &#34;As if anyone would buy that story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy flickered in Beatrice&#39;s eyes,barely masked by her air of disdain. What strange twist of fate allowed Grace, of all people, to end up with the Holdens? How did an orphan find a place among them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind,Johnny was hopeless. If he cared so much,why hadn&#39;t he asked his mother to bring her into their family himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right at that moment, Johnny appeared. His basketball jersey clung to his frame, hair still damp from his time on the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d just finished warming up for the game. Spotting the commotion and catching sight of Beatrice, he made his way over with a puzzled look. &#34;What&#39;s happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe wasted no time, directing everyone&#39;s attention to Grace. &#34;Johnny, look at this! Grace says her handbag is from the official store, but it&#39;s just a fake copy of Beatrice&#39;s!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s eyes narrowed as he inspected Grace&#39;s handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gold triangle on the handbag-he recognized it instantly. It belonged to this year&#39;s Lady Diamond limited run, only ten bags like it in the entire world,each marked with its own serial number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny..&#34; Beatrice&#39;s voice quivered as she slipped her hand around his arm, her eyes shining with unshed tears. &#34;If Grace really loves that bag, she can borrow mine for a while. She&#39;s part of your family now,andl wouldn&#39;t want anyone saying she has to settle for a fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every ounce of patience drained from Grace. Before she could respond, Johnny jumped in. A sheepish grin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>crept across his face as he scratched the back of his head. &#34;Actually, Grace&#39;s bag is the real deal. It&#39;s even a limited edition. I could only afford a regular one after saving up for ages. My mom gifted Grace hers -she&#39;s got VIP status at the brand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That settled it. The entire truth had come to light. A flush of humiliation spread across Beatrice&#39;s cheeks,as if she&#39;d just been slapped. Seconds earlier, she&#39;d paraded her certainty that Grace was carrying a counterfeit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the students surrounding them shot her uncertain glances, their voices buzzing with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Beatrice only has the standard version?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to say Grace was fakingit, but Grace&#39;s bag is the real deal-limited edition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you believe she even offered to let Grace borrow hers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This whole scene turned upside down so fast.I didn&#39;t expect that at all!&#34;</p>
