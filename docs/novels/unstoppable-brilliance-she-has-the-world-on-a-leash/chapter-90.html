                <p>Grace&#39;s genes were anything but ordinary-a handpicked blend of the brightest and strongest the elite world had to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her earliest days, she outpaced other children by leaps and bounds, mastering skills before most could even talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, all those years working in the shadows for her country had turned her into more of a tool than a person, moving through life without a hint of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joining the Holden family marked a turning point-now, she was wrapped in genuine affection. She became personal and human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s voice trembled as she stammered, &#34;I...I haven&#39;t done anything! Quit making up stories! If you&#39;ve got something on me, then prove it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more she turned it over in her mind,the more she convinced herself-Grace must be bluffing. If there were real evidence, Grace wouldn&#39;t waste time with threats. She&#39;d have already exposed her to Johnny. Clearly, this was just a psychological play-a classic move to spook her into making a mistake.She&#39;d never let herself be caught that easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine then, bring out your evidence. I doubt it would matter-Johnny would take my word over yours any day,&#34; Beatrice retorted, her earlier nerves fading,arrogance taking root again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Grace keep her composure only fueled Beatrice&#39;s sense of triumph. Her smirk grew wider,convinced she&#39;d seen right through the game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her usual hawk-likeattention, Grace noticed Johnny striding across the lawn, heading straight for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk about timing-he couldn&#39;t have shown up at a better moment.  Beatrice had been itching for an excuse to put Grace in her place for ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;d just stayed out of things, Grace, I wouldn&#39;t have wasted a second on a nobody like you. You&#39;re just a stray with no real family. Honestly, you don&#39;t even belong in my world! But since you decided to poke the bear... well, whatever happens next is on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, she lifted her hands and delivered two dramatic, echoing slaps to her own cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stared, taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the latest twist-threats giving way to a solo slap show?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice cut through her thoughts, and everything clicked into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beatrice? What are you doing out here?&#34; Johnny&#39;s voice rang out, worry laced through every syllable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he&#39;d heard Beatrice wasn&#39;t feeling well,he&#39;d made a beeline for the infirmary, only to spot her here by a bench and come rushing over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he drew closer and caught sight of her reddened cheeks, he stopped in his tracks.&#34;Beatrice...what happened to your face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Beatrice&#39;s eyes filled with tears, her voice trembling with expertly practiced distress. &#34;Johnny...thank goodness you&#39;re here. I don&#39;t know what I did wrong-your sister just attacked me for no reason...I only wanted to talk, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace did this to you?!&#34; Disbelief clouded Johnny&#39;s face, his features hardening as he tried to process the accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a trembling voice, Beatrice continued, &#34;| just thought... since she&#39;s your family, I should try to make peace. But she... she wouldn&#39;t even let me finish a sentence-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words faded away, but the insinuation lingered heavily in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, have you completely lost it? Who hits  someone out of nowhere like that?&#34; Johnny&#39;s voice rang out in sharp accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sliver of doubt gnawed at the back of his mind-random violence didn&#39;t sound like Grace at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But loyalty had a funny way of clouding judgment,and with Beatrice looking so pitiful, heknew which side he&#39;d take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Grace could get a word in, she calmly lifted her arm and, with practiced ease, landed two stinging slaps right across Beatrice&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint marks from earlier instantly flared into angry red welts, hot and throbbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked into stillness, Beatrice could do nothing but gape, her face burning and swelling beneath the sudden blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace wasn&#39;t built like the average girl. Even holding back, her strikes left a memory Beatrice would feel for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t lay a finger on her before. But since she&#39;s so determined to pin the blame on me-and I can&#39;t prove otherwise-l figure I might as well live up to her story.&#34; A casual shrug accompanied Grace&#39;s words.She&#39;d never tolerated being falsely accused. Rather than waste breath arguing, she&#39;d rather make the accusation a fact and end the farce right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice pressed a trembling hand to her cheek,staring in disbelief. &#34;Did you really just hit me?I can&#39;t believe you actually went through with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace tilted her head, her voice dripping with mock cheer. &#34;Weren&#39;t you just claiming I struck you for no reason? Now I&#39;m only doing what I&#39;m told. You ought to be grateful, honestly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, Grace kept to herself, but in that moment,she wielded her words like a blade, tearing into Beatrice without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny could only gape, frozen on the spot. Several seconds ticked by before Beatrice let out a pitiful whimper, tears beginning to spill, which finally snapped him out of his daze. He stepped forward, outrage coloring his tone.&#34;Grace, have you lost your mind? Why would you go after her like that? What did she ever do to deserve this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered a dismissive shrug. &#34;I&#39;ve already explained it. She hit herself, then tried to pin it on me.I just figured I might as well play along and give her something real to cry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with him, she watched his reaction.Her gaze held steady, cold and unblinking, as though daring him to challenge her version of the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been preparing a tirade, but when faced with that unflinching stare, the words dried up before they could leave his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence lingered. He could do nothing but stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s voice turned airy, almost indifferent.&#34;Whether you believe me or not, that&#39;s your call.&#34;With that, she spun on her heel and strode off,unaffected. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and now a small crowd of students drifted past, pausing to watch the spectacle with wide-eyed curiosity.</p>
