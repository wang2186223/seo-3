                <p>Client</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace walked alongside her adoptive parents, heading towards her new home together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped inside, her attention was locked on the sight in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the house radiated a refined charm-luxury woven through every detail, but not at the expense of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes wandered through the living room,where every relaxed accent or decoration turned out to be an irreplaceable treasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without letting go,Julia took Grace&#39;s hand and guided her up the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stopping at a polished door, Julia opened it with a hopeful smile and a hint of nerves. &#34;This is your room,Grace. I decorated it according to what I thought was best, since I wasn&#39;t sure what you&#39;d like. If anything feels off, just tell me and I&#39;ll have it changed right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the room, Grace noticed soothing beige walls, sunlight drifting in, and a gentle warmth filling</p>
                
                
                
                <p>every corner. Warmth crept into her chest,blooming softly and steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said softly, her voice quiet but sincere, &#34;There&#39;s nothing I would change. It&#39;s exactly right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight spread across Julia&#39;s face, lighting up her eyes.&#34;You see? I knew we&#39;d get along. I never dreamed I&#39;d have a daughter who shared my sense of style!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Julia, the feeling was nothing short of miraculous.It seemed as if fate had woven them together with invisible thread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Happiness bubbled up in her as she squeezed Grace&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Just knowing that I have a daughter now fills me with so much joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surprised look flashed across Grace&#39;s features before a genuine, shy smile appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Julia reached the doorway,she turned back,her voice kind and thoughtful. &#34;One more thing-your brothers James and Johnny had to leave for something urgent, but they&#39;ll be back tomorrow. I know they&#39;ll be so happy to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace returned the warmth,her smile peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Julia left, Grace closed the door behind her and sat on the edge of the bed, still soaking in the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone buzzed against her leg, the name &#34;Patrick&#34;popping up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she answered, Patrick Brown&#39;s animated voice burst through. &#34;Grace, I&#39;ve got fantastic news!The Pearson family is looking for your help. They&#39;re offering twenty million just for a single consultation,plus more depending on what you do next. Are you interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a second of hesitation showed as she answered,&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that she&#39;d become part of the Holden family,her main wish was to grow closer to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she appreciated the allure of wealth,tying herself to the Pearson family was asking for trouble of the highest order. She had always preferred to avoid drama whenever possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic laced Patrick&#39;s voice. &#34;Grace, think about it!We&#39;re talking about the Pearson family. Twenty million just to look at the patient, and that&#39;s before the real money comes in! Don&#39;t you want to sleep on it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loungingacross her bed, Grace wound a loose curl around her finger, not a hint of concern in her voice.&#34;My answer&#39;s the same. Not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to drop the subject, Patrick&#39;s tone dropped to a coaxing whisper. &#34;Look, the current head of the Pearson family isn&#39;t just anybody. The man&#39;s got the city in the palm of his hand, but he&#39;s on the brink-poisoned by something no one else could treat. Even the so-called &#39;Master Healer&#39; failed, which is why you&#39;re getting this call. They said you could name any price you want if you cure him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small pause hung in the air before Grace let out a soft, amused laugh. &#34;Of course Kevin Chadwick couldn&#39;t handle it. That guy was the weakest of all my apprentices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went quiet as Patrick tried to process the idea that Grace might be talking about the renowned Master Healer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boasting like that would have sounded foolish coming from anyone else. But when Grace said it, it seemed nothing short of the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s voice grew lighter as she chuckled again.&#34;Right now, my hands are full. I need time with the Holden family to settle in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick&#39;s shout came through loud and clear. &#34;Grace!This isn&#39;t just any client-it&#39;s the Pearsons! People wait a lifetime for this kind of break!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lazy stretch, Grace replied, her tone almost</p>
                
                
                
                <p>playful. &#34;Well, let them wait. If patience isn&#39;t part of the deal, then they&#39;re not serious about getting better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Grace let herself fall back on the bed,eyes wandering to the ceiling as her mind drifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images of that man she&#39;d met earlier flashed through her thoughts-a proud figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While stories of the head of the Pearson family had reached her ears, their paths had never crossed before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton Pearson&#39;s reputation for ruthless business dealings was matched only by his good looks, making him the subject of endless fascination among the city&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad his story always ended with the same rumor -he was running out of timne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint shrug, Grace rolled over and mumbled,&#34;That&#39;s not my problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate, however, seemed to have a different idea in store.</p>
