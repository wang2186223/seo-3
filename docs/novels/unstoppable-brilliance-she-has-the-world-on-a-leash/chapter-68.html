                <p>Grace wasn&#39;t surprised when Colton showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all,the Pearson family owned this auction house,and the third floor was their personal viewing area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only made sense that someone capable of offering such a staggering sum for the Rejuvenation Pill would be Colton. And for Colton, who had recently undergone detox, the pills would be especially useful,acting as a restorative aid in his healing process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what puzzled Grace was why he had come looking for her out of the blue. She asked directly, voicing her thoughts, &#34;Do you need something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did1. I didn&#39;t realize it was you bidding for the pills earlier. If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have tried to outbid you,&#34; Colton replied honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signaled to Dominick, who was standing behind him,to bring the expensive pills forward. &#34;If you are in urgent need of them, they are yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick swiftly handed her the finely crafted box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of shock at how</p>
                
                
                
                <p>willingly Colton gave up the pills. Was it possible that he had developed feelings for Grace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are for me?&#34; Grace arched a brow. &#34;You paid a hefty price for them. You should keep them. They are beneficial for your recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. You healed me, and I&#39;ll manage even without the two pills,&#34; Colton replied, acknowledging her past help, especially when she had saved his life.If she was this eager to obtain the pills, ithad to be urgently required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It probably wasn&#39;t easy to produce these pills.Otherwise, with her level of skill, she would have brewed up a fresh batch by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace wasn&#39;t one to stand on ceremony.Since he was insistent, she accepted the box without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana needed the pills urgently, and Grace planned to make more soon and repay Colton double. She didn&#39;t want to owe him a debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. I&#39;ll be going now,&#34; Grace said, offering a brief nod of appreciation before taking the box and leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Grace left, the warmth in Colton&#39;s expression vanished, replaced by his usual cold demeanor. This brought a sense of relief to Dominick. The way Colton had looked at Grace had been unlike anything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick had ever seen from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to ask Colton why he had given away such valuable pills, but he didn&#39;t dare speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Ryan showed up. After hearing what had happened, he wasted no time voicing the question Dominick dared not ask. &#34;Seriously? You just handed those priceless pills over to Grace Miller? What&#39;s going on? Are you falling for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To most who knew Colton, he came across as calculating,ruthless, and emotionally detached.Yet he also showed unwavering loyalty and generosity toward his close friends and subordinates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, his generosity was never without purpose. It usually came with expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore,why was he so kind to Grace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton wasn&#39;t just any mnan. With eyes constantly watching him and a secret identity to protect,he couldn&#39;t afford emotional entanglements with just any woman. Unless she had something of real value to offer him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Ryan&#39;s comment, Colton&#39;s calm, unreadable eyes narrowed slightly. Just as he was about to respond, his phone buzzed in his hand. He instinctively picked it up,and his pupils suddenly constricted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word to Ryan, he turned and headed straight back to his private room on the third floor,where everything he might need was within easy reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, he immediately began navigating his phone, clearly handling something urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having known him for so long, both Ryan and Dominick recognized the shift in mood and took up positions at the door to block any interruptions or prying ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s phone wasn&#39;t an ordinary device. It was a custom-built model with several advanced systems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he swiped, the interface shifted to a different system, revealing a specialized program filled with lines of code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the codes might have seemed like gibberish to others, Colton understood them instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then navigated to his email and opened a top-secret message safeguarded by multiple layers of encryption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reading its contents, he erased it without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing that Colton appeared to be done, Ryan walked over, his usual carefree attitude replaced with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a rare seriousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on? Did they hand down new orders?&#34;he asked, a thread of worry creeping into his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Colton now held immense power and influence, it hadn&#39;t always been that way. He had gone through relentless hardship and shown unwavering grit to rise to where he stood today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he feared no one now, the one who had shaped and trained him into the formidable force he&#39;d become still had a hold on him. If an order came down,he had no choice but to carry it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was what had forged his cold, unfeeling persona,making him appear detached, emotionless, and incapable of placing real trust or affection in anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They have assigned me to eliminate someone,&#34;Colton said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; Ryan asked, expecting it to be another drug lord or gambling kingpin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A secretly cultivated national genius,&#34; Colton answered.	1</p>
