                <p>By the time morning arrived, sunlight poured into the villa, painting the walls in golden streaks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger had spent the early hours making sure Grace&#39;s spot at Briskvale High was secured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the term already being well underway, his focus remained on helping Grace find her footing as swiftly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with her academic history making college look like a long shot, he insisted she join Briskvale High.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reasoning was simple-having Gianna and Johnny there meant Grace would never be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After straightening her collar, Grace made her way toward the living room at an easy pace, spotting two tall figures turned away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft light spilled over their frames. One stood with military-like poise, while the other leaned into a more laid-back stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cheerful wave from Julia drew her attention. &#34;Come here, Grace!&#34; she called out, her voice full of warmth.&#34;Your brothers are home. Let me introduce you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick pause let Grace gather her composure before she approached, flashing a cheerful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning first, the older brother towered above her,eyes sharp with intelligence and a hint of mystery curving his lips. Calm radiated from every inch of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost at the same moment, the younger brother turned around, his hair tousled and hoodie slightly askew. He slouched casually, hands deep in his pockets, an irreverent spark dancing in his eyes as he tossed her a crooked grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the older brother exuded quiet authority, the younger overflowed with restless energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia beamed with pride as she made the introductions.&#34;These are your brothers: James is the eldest, and Johnny is the second. Now our family is complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James gave a graceful nod, his voice deep and warm.&#34;We&#39;re glad you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow smirk tugged at Johnny&#39;s lips as he gave her a lingering once-over. &#34;So, you&#39;re our new little sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace responded with a gentle nod, her tone delicate,&#34;James, Johnny, nice to meet you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes swept down, lending her a gentle and quiet air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s gaze swept over her again, a teasing spark in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re heading to Briskvale High?&#34; he asked,a hint of challenge in his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin, Grace met his look and answered quietly, &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, isn&#39;t that convenient.&#34; Johnny let a slow smirk creep across his lips. &#34;Gianna and I are both in the Senior A. Any idea where you&#39;ll be placed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied with total honesty, &#34;They haven&#39;t told me yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny let out a slow &#34;Oh,&#34; tilting his head.&#34;Not just anybody gets into Briskvale High, you know. Try not to lag behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia shot her son a disapproving look. &#34;Honestly,Johnny. Is that any way to talk to your sister? You&#39;re asking for trouble with that attitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, he truly made her want to pull her hair out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a half-hearted shrug,Johnny let the matter drop,well aware that provoking Julia never ended well.Rodger&#39;s devotion to Julia meant Johnny risked more than a scolding if he kept pushing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the flicker of disdain in his eyes didn&#39;t go unnoticed. Grace pressed her lips together and chose not to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James shot his brother a cool, warning glance before turning to Grace. &#34;If you ever need anything, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, James,&#34; she replied obediently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Johnny huffed and headed upstairs. &#34;I&#39;m heading upstairs for a nap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia could only sigh and gave Grace a reassuring pat.&#34;Don&#39;t mind him. Johnny has his moments,but he&#39;ll come around. If he ever gives you trouble, you let me know and I&#39;ll set him straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Grace as she shook her head.&#34;No worries. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on Johnny&#39;s back as he disappeared upstairs, a spark of resolve glinting within them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,he wasn&#39;t ready to accept her just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she knew how to handle people like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James,however,seemed far easier to approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so much uncertainty, Grace sensed that life here would be anything but dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, she had the weekend to settle in before school began the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling into her chair, her mind drifted to the encrypted message Patrick had sent earlier-news about a rare foxglove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The formula she&#39;d been perfecting absolutely depended on a compound only the rare foxglove could provide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers danced across the keyboard, and soon her computer&#39;s screen glowed to life. She wasted no time logging into her secure email and clicking open Patrick&#39;s latest tip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message read, &#34;The rare foxglove located-shop No. 17, underground market. Only a handful are aware.Seller&#39;s wary. Move quickly if you want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of satisfaction flashed in her eyes, her lips curving into a sly smile. Clearly, this errand would need her personal touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped into casual clothes-something understated but tidy-and readied herself to head out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the sight of Julia arranging fresh blooms greeted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I&#39;ll be out for a while. Promise I&#39;ll be home</p>
                
                
                
                <p>before dinner,&#34; Grace remarked, her tone light,her smile reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia put aside her flowers right away, her voice tinged with concern. &#34;Where are you off to? Would you like a driver to go with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving her phone, Grace shook her head.&#34;No worries.I&#39;ll catch a cab-I know the address by heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, Julia nodded, launching into a string of reminders. &#34;Watch out for strangers, and call me if you need help. If you see anything you like, just buy it -money&#39;s not a problem here...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered a patient nod. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she stepped onto the front door, Julia&#39;s voice followed after her, warm with care.&#34;Come home early and take care of yourself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle concern lingered,warming Grace from the inside out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, the feeling of being looked after felt genuinely comforting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hopping into a cab, she headed straight for the renowned underground market.</p>
