                <p>Through the rearview mirror, Ryan&#39;s eyes sparkled with anticipation. &#34;We&#39;re almost at the hospital. Dr. Payne will be ready to run a full set of checks on you as soon as we arrive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mysterious condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? That&#39;s incredible news!&#34; Ryan broke into a wide grin, the relief in his voice impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis nudged his glasses up and explained in a careful tone, &#34;Initial results suggest that the toxin levels have dropped. But it&#39;s too soon to tell whether this is justa brief respite or a genuine cure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gleam of curiosity lit up his eyes. &#34;Whoever stepped in must be a genius. I&#39;d jump at the chance to learn from that doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intensity flickered in Colton&#39;s stare. The simple pill Grace handed him had worked wonders-far outstripping the expensive procedures and endless therapies his doctors had tried for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself wondering about her true identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a broad smile, Ryan clapped his hands together.&#34;Colton, you just got a miracle! That girl-she&#39;s your lucky charm!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of Grace&#39;s steady composure crept into Colton&#39;s mind, and a faint smile played on his lips. &#34;At the very least, this buys us more time to track down Dr.Q.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing his palms together, Ryan could hardly contain his excitement. &#34;We&#39;ll double the offer! If one billion wasn&#39;t enough, then two should do it. Money talks, and she&#39;s bound to listen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing his brow, Colton replied in a quiet tone,&#34;Somehow, I doubt money is her main concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite everything, he found himself intrigued by Grace. She seemed to hold answers he desperately needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, fate had handed him a surprise he welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain that another meeting with Grace wasn&#39;t far off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than wait in the endless line of cars, Grace decided to make her way home on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a quick stop at a charming old ice cream shop, treating herself to a cone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cool vanilla and creamy milk flavors lingered as she wandered along, enjoying every bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the sky turning darker, she quickened her steps,determined not to let Rodger and Julia worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she reached the porch, Julia appeared, beaming warmly. Swinging the ornate door wide open, she said,&#34;You&#39;re just in time. There&#39;s something important we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twisting in his seat, Dominick&#39;s concern was plain.&#34;How are you holding up,Mr.Pearson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton shifted his feet with careful attention, surprise flickering across his face. &#34;The heat inside me is gone,and I&#39;m feeling more comfortable now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting his hand against his knee, he added, &#34;What&#39;s more...I can actually feel my legs again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poisoning had left him numb from the waist down for what felt like ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Ryan&#39;s hands tightened around the wheel,knuckles turning white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having known Colton for years, he understood exactly what that change implied. This was the first time in three years sensation had returned to Colton&#39;s legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the black Cayenne pulled up to the main doors of the Pearson Group&#39;s exclusive medical center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Set on the edge of town, this pristine facility gleamed in the afternoon sun, staffed with elite doctors and packed with state-of-the-art technology-all under the Pearson name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pearson has arrived!&#34; a medical staff member called out as the team hurried to meet him, already prepped for his visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lewis Payne hurried over with long strides. As an internationally renowned medical expert, he&#39;d been recruited by the Pearson family three years prior, solely to oversee Colton&#39;s care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing behind him were six renowned specialists, each looking serious and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Another flare-up, Mr. Pearson?&#34; Lewis asked, peering over his glasses at Colton&#39;s flushed features. &#34;We&#39;ll get you started on a complete assessment right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, he coordinated a series of tests for Colton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About ten minutes later, he reviewed the results, his expression shifting from confusion to surprise. &#34;Mr.Pearson, some of the toxins have disappeared from your system. Did you receive any new treatment recently?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation stunned Lewis; his entire team had spent years chasing dead ends with Colton&#39;s need to talk about together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna occupied a quiet corner, absorbed in her book and barely making a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a graceful flourish, Julia produced an invitation adorned with elegant details. &#34;Take a look at what showed up today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With careful fingers, she opened it. &#34;This is an invitation to a high-profile banquet happening this weekend,exclusively for young women from influential families. The city&#39;s most prominent ladies will be attending. I believe it would be a great opportunity for you two to mingle and learn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every year, the Holden family found themselves on the guest list for gatherings like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, Gianna had become quite familiar with these grand affairs, using them to build close connections with the city&#39;s upper crust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, the idea of another elegant banquet brought a spark of excitement to Gianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the idea of Grace joining in quickly erased her enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone was laughable. In her eyes, Grace was nothing more than an outsider, someone who didn&#39;t understand the unwritten rules of the social elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt certain Grace would only make a spectacle of herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Grace, banquets like these held little appeal,since she saw herself blending into the background,unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she understood her mother&#39;s reasoning-Julia wanted her to find her place as quickly as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the hope shining in Julia&#39;s eyes, Grace managed a nod. &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s wonderful news, Grace! You&#39;ll have the chance to meet so many interesting people,&#34; Julia exclaimed,her whole face lighting up. &#34;I&#39;ve already ordered custom gowns from Maison Blanche. They&#39;ll be delivered tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clapped with delight. &#34;Wait until you see the one with all the sparkling details!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna finally set her book aside and spoke up, her voice soft but measured. &#34;If there&#39;s anything you&#39;re unsure about, you can always ask me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in her tone was flawless, but to Grace, it felt distant, like those glimmering displaysin fancy shop windows-impressive, yet far removed from reality.</p>
