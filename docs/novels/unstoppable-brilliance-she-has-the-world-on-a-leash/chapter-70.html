                <p>Ryan wilted under Colton&#39;s steady gaze, nerves fraying until he nearly let out a squeak. Only when Colton shifted his eyes away did the tension finally break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneerescaped Colton as he walked off, leaving any words unsaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door closed behind him, Ryan let out a shaky breath, pressing a hand to his chest before he shot a questioning look at Dominick,who&#39;d watched everything in silence. &#34;Can you explain that? What&#39;s with that sneer? Did I mess up? I thought he liked Grace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick hesitated, edging away fom Ryan&#39;s reach.&#34;I... I couldn&#39;t say. No one&#39;s ever been able to guess what he&#39;s thinking,&#34; he replied, then darted out after Colton before more questions could come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s thoughts remained a mystery. He wore his detachment like armor, and his interest in Grace might have run deeper than simple gratitude-though what else lay beneath, Dominick wasn&#39;t brave enough to imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever the truth, he would never dare ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning home from the auction, Gianna and Claire carried with them only disappointment, dreading the moment they&#39;d have to face their family members,but they couldn&#39;t avoid it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s voice trembled with regret as she spoke. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mom. We weren&#39;t able to win the Rejuvenation Pill-the bidding was overwhelming, and there was no way to compete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gap in resources left her helpless, unable to change what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle sigh escaped Eliana. &#34;Given that we were up against the Pearsons, it&#39;s hardly surprising we lost out,&#34;she said, her disappointment tempered with understanding rather than blame for her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought had lingered in her mind that there might not be a cure for her at all. Having come this far and still being alive already felt like more than she could have asked for. The rest was in fate&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least she had been given a little more time. Once she regained some strength, she fully intended to confront her husband and reclaim what rightfully belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever she managed to win back, she would leave</p>
                
                
                
                <p>for her daughter&#39;s future, hoping that, even in her absence,Claire would never have to struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s voice rang with reassurance as she stepped forward, having accompanied Rodger for this visit.&#34;Try not to lose heart, Eliana. Those pills aren&#39;t your only hope. With Grace by your side, you&#39;ll get the care you need, and I believe you&#39;ll recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger echoed his wife&#39;s encouragement, adding his own quiet conviction. &#34;Julia&#39;s absolutely right. Stay optimistic-your mental outlook is just as important as any medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their combined support eased some of the weight pressing on Eliana&#39;s chest, and her mood gradually lifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, trouble always seemed to find its way in.Someone piped up with a tone dripping with false concern. &#34;You know, I really think we might&#39;ve gotten those pills if Grace hadn&#39;t objected. She said it cost too much and didn&#39;t think it was worth the risk. She was worried about us being able to pay, so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna was the one stirring the pot. Still harboring resentment towards Grace, she jumped at the chance to speak poorly of Grace behind her back, hoping to sway the family&#39;s opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire knew full well that Gianna&#39;s claim was a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fabrication-Grace hadn&#39;t said anything of the sort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But,catching Gianna&#39;s pleading look and remembering all the years they&#39;d been friends, Claire kept quiet,even if it left her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia was quick to jump in, her voice sharp and unwavering. &#34;That&#39;s out of the question! Grace would never act that way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though her time with Grace had been short,her faith in the girl never wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was also the practical side to consider. Why should Grace worry about the price? The Holden family would have covered the expense, not Grace herself, so what possible motive could she have for objecting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People weren&#39;t so easily misled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any trace of warmth in Julia&#39;s expression toward Gianna vanished, replaced by a clear, cold distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by Julia&#39;s stern look, Gianna felt a stab of guilt, her eyes darting away before she quickly resumed her act, still clinging to her supposed sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s words followed, calm but resolute. &#34;Let&#39;s not place blame on Grace. She&#39;s always been thoughtful and dependable. If her intentions weren&#39;t good, she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>never would&#39;ve gone to such lengths for Eliana&#39;s surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rodger didn&#39;t display his affection as openly as Julia,his faith in Grace ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every moment spent with Grace had only made his respect grow-she was levelheaded and talented,no matter what others whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by such unwavering loyalty and wvarmth toward Grace, Gianna&#39;s frustration festered, the truth settling in that her influence had faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calculated attempts to undermine Grace fell flat,her motives now plain to everyone,leaving her feeling exposed and out of place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she&#39;d thought to bring Ethel along. With Ethel&#39;s support, she might have found an ally and avoided this humiliating defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Grace stepped into the room,her arrival only deepening Gianna&#39;s sense of unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Grace entered, everyone gravitated toward her, with Julia&#39;s worry shining the brightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia hurried over, fussing with gentle affection.&#34;Grace, I thought you would go home and catch up on your sleep. You must be tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brushing off the concern with a quiet composure,Grace replied, &#34;Fatigue isn&#39;t an issue. I came to deliver the Rejuvenation Pill for Aunt Eliana.&#34; Her calm announcement sent a quiet shockwave through the room, the news landing like a pebble dropped into still water.</p>
