                <p>Rumors</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace glanced out the window and said offhandedly,&#34;I&#39;m going to school recently, so I won&#39;t have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just don&#39;t get it. Why go back to school? With everything you know, you could be teaching at the best university as a professor,&#34; Patrick said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace turned to him, serious now. &#34;Don&#39;t you think it would be fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fun? Not even close. Patrick shook his head. They could be making real money out there, but Grace wasn&#39;t interested. What a waste of talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, by the way-someone&#39;s been asking around about you. Says it&#39;s about some medical issue.What should we do?&#34; Patrick asked. He had connections everywhere,and Grace usually left these things for him to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep blocking them. I&#39;m not interested.&#34; Grace just wanted a quiet life now, something that felt warm and normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got into the car, chatting with Patrick, she didn&#39;t notice two girls standing a little distance away,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>phones raised, snapping pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lizzie rubbed her eyes and yanked on Gianna&#39;s sleeve.&#34;Gianna, Look! Isn&#39;t that Grace? Why is she getting into that Mercedes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna followed her gaze, stunned to see Grace sitting effortlessly in a luxurious car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window was slightly down, and the driver was an attractive young man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s weird. What is she doing in a car like that? But that&#39;s not Uncle Rodger&#39;s car,&#34; Gianna said slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had grown up in an orphanage. Where would she even meet someone that rich? She&#39;d gotten herself a sugar daddy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a shame. What would her family say if they knew?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lizzie&#39;s eyes widened, sparkling with scandal. &#34;I&#39;ve heard of girls like her charm some rich guy and get taken care of. Sell their pride for a fancy life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna pretended to be shocked. &#34;You think Grace would really do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else could it be?&#34; Lizzie said, smirking. &#34;Look at her-smooth skin, perfect hair. She doesn&#39;t look like someone who grew up in an orphanage. She looks like one of those rich girls on social media. And that man?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s no college student.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe he&#39;s just a friend?&#34; Gianna offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lizzie scoffed. &#34;Gianna, you&#39;re too innocent. Grace is hiding something. Just wait and see. Something big&#39;s going to come out soon. And you should stay away from her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna gave a slow nod. This was exactly what she&#39;d wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lizzie was a talker. Give her something juicy, and she&#39;d make sure the whole school heard about it by morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna knew rumors would spread on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Grace opened the door to her house,she was hit with the delicious smell of home-cooked food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia peeked out from the kitchen, her apron slightly stained with sauce. &#34;Grace, go wash up! Dinner&#39;s ready -I made it myself today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia loved tending to her plants and experimenting with new dishes in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smells amazing,&#34; Grace said, taking a deep breath,her usual calm expression softening into a smile that made her look her age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Rodger and Johnny walked in through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>James,who was busy withhis internship, only dropped by once in a while now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they all sat down to eat, Rodger asked gently,&#34;Grace,how was your day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Smooth,&#34; she replied,nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny rolled his eyes and muttered, &#34;I heard someone with terrible grades got kicked out of the honors class for cheating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Johnny!&#34; Rodger&#39;s voice thundered as he slammed his hand on the table. His usual calm was gone.&#34;Watch your mouth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny raised his hands like he was innocent and pulled out his phone. &#34;I&#39;m just saying what everyone else is saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, it&#39;s true I&#39;m no longer in the honors class, but l didn&#39;t cheat. I&#39;ll prove myself with my next results,&#34;Grace said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could have gone to the teachers&#39; office to clear her name, but she didn&#39;t want to be seen as a troublemaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, time had a way of revealing who people really were. The truth always came out in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another exam was just around the corner. That would be her chance to let her results do the talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia quickly put her fork down too, concern on her face. &#34;Grace,what happened exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, it&#39;s nothing serious. Just a little misunderstanding. Honestly, I like my new class,&#34;Grace reassured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If anything happens again, you have to tell us,&#34; Julia said firmly. &#34;We&#39;re here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will.&#34; Grace nodded,grateful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After dinner, she went up to her room,only for her phone to start ringing. It was Adrianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d only just exchanged numbers after school,so Grace was surprised to see her call. She answered quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Check the school forum. Someone posted something about you. I know it&#39;s all lies, but they&#39;re spreading rumors. I just wanted to let you know,&#34; Adrianna said,her voice rushed with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t known each other long, but they&#39;d clicked</p>
                
                
                
                <p>right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna could already tell Grace wasn&#39;t like the things people said online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks. I&#39;ll look,&#34; Grace said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was curious to see exactly what kind of game those students were playing.</p>
