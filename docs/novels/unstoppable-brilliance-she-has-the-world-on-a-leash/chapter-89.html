                <p>&#34;Hey, did you see how Adrianna Walsh got rid of that dark mark on her face? l&#39;ve been up all night studying, and my skin&#39;s been acting up. Can you ask your sister if I could get some of her stuff too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice knew how to get her way with Johnny. A little charm, a sweet tone-he usually gave in without much resistance. Today should be no different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her shock, Johnny replied without hesitation,&#34;No,I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s smile faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny must&#39;ve sensed the tension and felt he was too blunt. It was rare for him to feel uneasy. &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Beatrice,&#34; he said quickly. &#34;I just don&#39;t think you should take Grace&#39;s products too seriously.She&#39;s always mixing random stuff without any clear source. It&#39;s not exactly... safe. What if it messes up your skin in a few weeks? It&#39;s not worth the risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice opened her mouth to push back-she had made a promise to Chloe and didn&#39;t want to seem unreliable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny had a point. If her face broke out or worse,it&#39;d be a disaster. No apology would fix that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My mom&#39;s got memberships with all the major skincare brands,&#34; Johnny added, trying to soften the blow. &#34;I&#39;ll get you something better. Sound good?&#34;Since it was the first time Johnny had ever turned Beatrice down, guilt crept in quickly, and he rushed to make it up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, asking Grace for anything was complicated. He didn&#39;t want to owe her, and he definitely didn&#39;t want to deal with his mother&#39;s suspicions if she caught wind of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His family didn&#39;t know he was dating, and the thought of their probing questions made him uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice perked up. &#34;Johnny, you&#39;re the best.&#34; Even if she only got a little at a time, luxury skincare from top brands was more than most girls could dream of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t complain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny relaxed a little when he saw her smile again,but deep down, he felt drained. This was what girls liked,right? Being spoiled?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lunch, Beatrice claimed she needed a nap and parted ways with Johnny. In reality, she had another man to meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people would think this could be exhausting,sneaking off between classes like this-but to her, it was thrilling. After all, being spoiled by rich men of all kinds and showered with gifts was the kind of life most average-looking girls could only dream about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice was not able to rest, and by afternoon, the effects of skipping rest caught up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next class was PE-thankfully. She could fake feeling unwell and sneak off to the infirmary to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was halfway there when she saw a face she didn&#39;t want to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her memory, Grace always acted like she enjoyed being on her own. Maybe it was because no one had the patience to handle her attitude, let alone try to be her friend.Beatrice had been wanting a face-to-face with Grace for a while, and now that the moment was here, she wasn&#39;t going to waste it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you sitting here all alone? Where&#39;s your sidekick, Adrianna?&#34; Beatrice&#39;s tone was smug,confident that her opening jab would get under Grace&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Grace didn&#39;t flinch. She sat on a bench, still, eyes closed, like she hadn&#39;t heard a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice frowned, thinking maybe Grace had dozed off. She stepped closer, dropped the soft-girl act,and said sharply, &#34;You don&#39;t have PE now. Sitting here like this, aren&#39;t you scared of getting a demerit for skipping class?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no response. Beatrice suddenly felt foolish, like she was talking to a statue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you deaf or what?!&#34; she snapped, her voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>louder now, fueled by frustration. At last, Grace opened her eyes just a sliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you dumb or something? I heard you barking the whole time like a stray. Does Johnny know you act like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beatrice&#39;s breath caught in her throat. So Grace had heard her all along and deliberately ignored her-just to make her squirm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like a madwoman,&#34; Grace said calmly,leaning back like she had all the time in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve insulting me! I&#39;m warning you-l recorded all this. I&#39;ll show it to Johnny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Be sure to include the part about which guy you were sweet-talking today. No sleep at night, no rest at noon, those dark circles are no joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut your mouth!&#34; Beatrice&#39;s heart skipped. How did Grace know that? Had she bugged her? It was uncanny-too specific to be a guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I&#39;m telling the truth.&#34; Grace&#39;s voice lost all sweetness. The calm, kind front she wore for the world had vanished. She chose who deserved it--and Beatrice didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Beatrice with disdain. Johnny really deserved better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slander me again without proof and I&#39;ll sue you for defamation!&#34; Beatrice snapped, trying to sound tough,though her voice cracked a little at the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace tilted her head. &#34;You really are gifted.&#34;Beatrice blinked. A compliment? She straightened slightly. Well, it wasn&#39;t a lie. She was talented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Grace added, &#34;You really have a talent for keeping your cool, even when your dirty little secret is out in the open. I warn you, stay away from Johnny.I couldn&#39;t care less about the rest of your sugar daddies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace rarely got involved in things that weren&#39;t her business. She was known for being cold and distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her intellect and eerie calm, she lacked certain emotional traits. Still, the Holden family had filled in those missing parts well enough-especially when it came to protecting what mattered.</p>
