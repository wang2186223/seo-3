                <p>Inside Briskvale High, the usual school day faded into the background as Gianna made her way to the office the instant the dismissal bell sounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a measured politeness, Gianna asked, &#34;Did you need something from me, Ms. Dixon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, Grace Miller is related to you? I only just found out,&#34; Ellie said, her forehead wrinkling with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Gianna off guard. Quickly,she replied, &#34;Grace was adopted by my uncle from an orphanage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie&#39;s lips twisted in disdain. A sharp breath escaped her as she replied, &#34;No wonder she&#39;s rude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle breath of relief slipped from Gianna. She nodded, saying, &#34;She also spent her childhood bouncing between foster families and the orphanage.So she is a bit eccentric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on a show of worry, she heaved a sigh and added, &#34;My uncle wanted to help, so he brought Grace home. No one expected she&#39;d end up causing trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting her glasses with practiced annoyance, Ellie spoke. &#34;It&#39;s hardly shocking she mouthed off at me during the test. That&#39;s what comes from a lack of proper upbringing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her desk, she produced a test paper, her movements brisk. &#34;Here. You should see these-her scores from the placement test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kept the results hidden, fully intending to flaunt them at the upcoming exam, eager to embarrass Grace in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising through the ranks from nothing, Ellie wore her authority like armor and never tolerated anyone, much less a student, being rude to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The paper landed in Gianna&#39;s hands. Her eyes widened at the glaring red mark sprawled across the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this actually be real? Wasn&#39;t Grace always ranked at the bottom of every class? Hadn&#39;t everyone whispered that she barely made the cut?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to mask her surprise, Gianna forced a shaky smile. &#34;Ms. Dixon, is it possible there&#39;s been some kind of mistake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie&#39;s patience snapped. Her palm hit the desk with a smack. &#34;Grace must have cheated! What other explanation is there for a student with her record to score that high?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna fidgeted with her sleeve. &#34;Maybe my uncle arranged for Grace to get some extra help, like a private tutor or something...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie let out a snort of disbelief. &#34;A tutor? Please. Her history speaks for itself. Not even the brightest mind could drag her up from where she started.&#34; She rattled the paper in her grip. &#34;I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on her during the next exams. If she pulls another stunt, she&#39;s finished here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Gianna&#39;s satisfaction threatened to show, but she quickly replaced it with an anxious expression. &#34;Please, don&#39;t take it to heart. I&#39;ll do my best to talk some sense into her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a sensible girl, Gianna. Try not to get mixed up with her. I want to see you succeed. You&#39;re my top student. I&#39;ll be giving you more advanced lessons soon,so when Prof. Warren stops by, you&#39;ll stand out from the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her heart raced with excitement, Gianna played the part of the modest student. &#34;Thank you for having faith in me. I&#39;ll put in my best effort, but with so many gifted students around, I worry I might fall short.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile touched Ellie&#39;s lips. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t doubt yourself. Your fundamentals are rock solid. If you keep this up, Summit University will be within reach.Prof. Warren is coming to find new talent, and that research article you published really made people take notice. He might already know your name, so stand tall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A simple nod from Gianna sealed her determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie reached over and handed Gianna a fresh stack of practice exercises to complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning a place for Gianna at Summit would cement Ellie&#39;s status as the school&#39;s top educator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the classroom buzzed with excitement as word spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry Warren was almost a legend, famous for pushing the boundaries of research. Landing a place on his team could set a student up for a remarkable career.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small groups gathered, energy rising as the news of Terry&#39;s visit traveled through the halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Prof. Warren&#39;s group published three &#39;Nature&#39;papers last year. That&#39;s wild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone who joins his lab has a one-way ticket to academic stardom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be real. Gianna White&#39;s got that spotin the bag.Ms. Dixon&#39;s been preparing her for ages.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace ignored the whispers, choosing not to get involved, but she genuinely felt happy to see Terry doing so well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The school day drew to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Parked just beyond the gates, a polished black SUV hummed softly. Behind the wheel, Colton lounged with a watchful gaze fixed on the steady stream of students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm edge in his voice, he asked, &#34;Dominick, are you certain this information checks out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick responded with careful respect, &#34;Yes, I&#39;ve verified it. That girl&#39;s name is Grace Miller, and she&#39;s in the same classas Charles Pearson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were the odds of this connection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of irritation clouded Colton&#39;s face as his thoughts grew heavier. Tracking Grace down todayhad become his mission-he needed answers about her earlier remarks. At their very first encounter,she had immediately figured out that he was suffering from poison. She definitely knew something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Grace stepped outside, her posture relaxed as she scanned the sidewalk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick wasted no time and made his way toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in her tracks, taking in the sight of the familiar face. Wasn&#39;t this the same man who had fiercely competed against her for an item in the underground market? Why was he tracking her down now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze narrowed as suspicion took hold. Maybe he&#39;d come to reclaim the item? But that ship had sailed-she&#39;d already used it for her medicines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to appear composed, Dominick addressed her.&#34;Miss Miller, my employer, Mr. Pearson, would like a moment of your time, if that&#39;s alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s voice held steady. &#34;I have no idea who you people are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick apologized quickly, his anxiety clear as sweat appeared along his hairline. &#34;Sorry for the trouble,truly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He darted a look between her and the SUV, clearly anxious to get this over with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned sigh, Grace gave in. &#34;Fine,I&#39;l hear what he has to say.&#34;</p>
