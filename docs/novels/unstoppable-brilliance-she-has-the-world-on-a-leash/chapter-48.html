                <p>Stepping into the restaurant, the group found themselves surrounded by quiet luxury. Gentle lights cast a warm glow, and the staff welcomed them with graceful professionalism as they were guided to their table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of triumph passed between Claire and Gianna.Choosing this fancy place had been no accident. Both were certain Grace would falter and make a spectacle of herself. They believed any girl who grew up in an orphanage wouldn&#39;t have a clue about high-end dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly able to contain herself, Gianna reached for the menu. She flipped through its pages with exaggerated elegance and announced her order with relish, &#34;I&#39;ll start with escargot, then foie gras with black truffle, and for my main,beef Wellington-medium rare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That order was followed by a pointed glance at Grace,her expression practically daring her to keep up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she traded another knowing look with Claire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing along, Claire smiled sweetly and slid the ornate menu toward Grace. &#34;Would you like some suggestions? The house specialties are quite something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding the ornate menu closer, she offered it to Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna chimed in with mock sincerity, &#34;You probably haven&#39;t been to a place like this much. Need me to explain how it works?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting their eyes with steady calm, Grace&#39;s lips formed a quiet smile. &#34;That&#39;s not necessary. I can handle it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A barely audible snort escaped Gianna. She muttered,&#34;Keep pretending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia noticed the exchange, a crease of concern forming on her brow, but before she could intervene,Grace turned to the waiter. With flawless French and an air of confidence, she made her order. She ordered lobster salad as an appetizer, followed by Rossini-style filet mignon cooked medium rare for her main course.To complement her meal, she chose a bottle of 2009Château Margaux.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter paused, pleasantly surprised by her fluency,and replied with a respectful nod.&#34;An	excellent selection,mademoiselle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Claire and Gianna sat motionless, shock written plainly across their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really speaking French and that smoothly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Eliana&#39;s eyes sparkled with curiosity. &#34;You speak French, Grace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace simply shrugged, her tone humble.&#34;Abit.Just something I picked up along the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride shimmered in Julia&#39;s eyes. &#34;Grace learns everything so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire forced a grin, her voice just a touch too bright.&#34;Yeah... that&#39;s really something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna refused to back down, snapping her napkin open with exaggerated care, eyes glued to Grace,ready for even the smallest mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace, on the other hand, settled her napkin across her lap with the kind of grace that belonged in etiquette manuals, every gesture calm and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the appetizers made their way to the table. Gianna stared at her plate of escargot, appetite vanishing in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers trembled as she tried to work the snail tongs, fumbling clumsily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like a tip?&#34; Grace offered in a gentle tone,leaning over. &#34;It&#39;s easier if you tilt your hand just so-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can handle it!&#34; Gianna snapped, gripping the utensil  too tightly. In a flash, the snail shell slipped free and launched itself onto Claire&#39;s dress, leaving behind a slick trail of garlic butter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shriek burst from Claire. &#34;My dress! Look what you&#39;ve done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conversation in the restaurant hushed as curious faces turned in their direction, some openly staring at the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment colored Eliana&#39;s face, her mood darkening by the second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Julia brought her spoon to her lips, the flicker of a smile betraying her amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the main courses arrived, Grace managed her utensils with quiet confidence, expertly carving her filet mignon with a finesse that put both Claire and Gianna to shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna faced her own disaster. Her beef Wellington had been cooked to ruin-dry, tough, and nearly impossible to cut through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration bubbling over, she slammed her knife down, shattering the pastry shell. A splash of meat juice leapt onto her cheek, sealing her embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation burned hot across her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one at the table missed the contrast. Grace&#39;s composure was effortless, her knowledge of dining unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride warmed Julia&#39;s features. &#34;You never know what Grace will surprise us with next,&#34;she remarked, her voice bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Claire and Gianna sat stiffly, their plan to disgrace Grace in shambles, their faces darkening with each passing moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment pressed down, thick and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hide her resentment, Gianna eyed the elegant shopping bags resting by Grace&#39;s side. Her voice came out brittle and sharp. &#34;Julia, you really go all out for Grace. All that jewelry must&#39;ve cost a small fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was reckless spending, in her opinion. If Ethel ever got wind of it, Grace would be in for a scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia brushed it aside with a carefree laugh, &#34;That barely cost anything, Only seven million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven million? Jealousy lit a fire in Gianna&#39;s eyes. Just a year ago, she&#39;d pleaded for a bracelet worth a mere million, yet now Grace had wvalked away with jewelry bags worth several times more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire managed a smile that barely hid her discomfort.&#34;Grace, you hit the jackpot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small smile and a gentle tone, Grace replied,&#34;Honestly, having a mom who spoils mne feels like a real gift.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire and Gianna gripped their forks so tightly it was a miracle the utensils didn&#39;t snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need for food anymore. Anger alone left them feeling full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Colton dined at another table in the same restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This spot was owned by Ryan-his fingerprints were on every high-end eatery and porivate club in the city. Now that Colton was feeling better, he showed up for meals from time to time. Otherwise, his uncle would probably think he had disappeared for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze landed on Grace and her family. He had no intention of disturbing them. Instead, he leaned over and quietly told Dominick to pick up their tab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick took care of everything right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,when the meal wrapped up and Julia made her way to the register, she was surprised to learn someone had already settled the bill. The cashier mentioned a Mr.Pearson had taken care of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group exchanged puzzled looks. Grace knew instantly who it was, but she decided to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire, of course, couldn&#39;t help but stir up some mischief. &#34;Maybe one of Gianna&#39;s fans decided to pay for us. She has boys lined up around the block just to catch her attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to be embarrassed, Gianna said, &#34;You have to stop, Claire. That&#39;s not true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she clung to the hope that it really was one of her admirers-certainly not someone doing it for Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace ignored the comment completely. Some people just never tire of flattering themselves.</p>
