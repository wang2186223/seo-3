                <p>&#34;Next time? And when exactly will that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton wasn&#39;t just making small talk-he wanted a solid answer. With Grace, things could easily be dragged out for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Grace, it sounded like he was just eager to get his hands on the pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no rush. The poison&#39;s already cleared from your system. Your body&#39;s back to normal. Whether you take those pills or not won&#39;t really make a difference now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton didn&#39;t drop the subject. &#34;So? When are you planning to give them to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saturday sounds good? I don&#39;t have any classes then, so I can bring the pills to you myself,&#34; Grace said, her lips curving slightly. He really wasn&#39;t patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saturday&#39;s fine. Bring me the pils and I&#39;ll treat you to a meal.&#34; He added the offer as if it were no big deal, but that last part mattered more to him than he let on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t turn him down. Those pills didn&#39;t come cheap,and in return, a meal was a small ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, the conversation quieted. Neither of them was big on small talk, and the silence inside the car settled in fast-calm, still, almost eerie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colton was used to silence. Being reserved and distant was second nature to him. Sitting quietly like this didn&#39;t feel strange at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then they both noticed it. A car was following them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them said anything. Instead, they both subtly glanced at the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton pressed harder on the gas, hoping to lose the car behind them, but it was no use-the ones tailing them were skilled trackers. They were sticking close without letting up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s calm gave way to irritation. &#34;Hold on,&#34; he muttered, and with a sharp twist of the wheel,the car jerked forward, swerving and drifting through traffic with practiced skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the pursuers didn&#39;t back off. They matched him move for move and even rammed into the back of his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Colton&#39;s car was reinforced and bulletproof, the vehicle chasing them was just as tough-clearly built for this kind of job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace quickly realized this wasn&#39;t some random ambush. These people had serious, powerful backing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be the so-called &#34;Devil&#34; from the northern faction? Had they finally tracked her down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though there were two factions, they all came from the same core organization, which made it hard to tell whether the attackers were from the southern faction or the northern faction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the person who gave the order would know for sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s mind was going through the same possibilities. If his cover had been blown, maybe the southern faction had finally made a move to get rid of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever they were, it was impossible to figure out right now. And with the chase getting more intense by the second, the only option left was to face them head-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s car, built for speed and power, held its own with ease, making it tough for the pursuers to gain the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t care about crashing or about damage-they were clearly here to finish the job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, another car appeared, cutting them off and forcing Colton toward the edge of a narrow bridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to think. Jumping out would be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the safest option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jump now!&#34; Grace shouted, throwing the door open and leaping without waiting for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton reacted instantly. Before she even landed, he grabbed her mid-air and shielded her with his body as they tumbled down the embankment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, they hit soft grass instead of concrete,rolling roughly but escaping with just a few scrapes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, the two black cars didn&#39;t stop or check -they made a sharp U-turn and sped away,disappearing without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way they moved-fast, focused, and without hesitation-made it clear they were professionally trained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt about it now-they had been sent by someone high up in the ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s calm gaze sharpened, a flicker of anger rising beneath the surface, while Colton&#39;s eyes narrowed, dark and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What just happened?&#34; he asked. &#34;I&#39;m always direct with people. I don&#39;t have enemies. Are you sure this wasn&#39;t meant for you?&#34; Colton played it cool, acting like he had nothing to do with it, casually trying to shift the blame onto Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a student,&#34; she replied, eyes wide with innocence.&#34;Why would I have enemies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton raised an eyebrow. &#34;Right. A simple student.Not an underground miracle healer with a secret side job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you, Mr. Pearson, a company president with power and connections-shouldn&#39;t you be the one with a longer enemy list?&#34; Grace shot back, not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them said it out loud, but the same thought ran through their minds. &#34;This attack was meant for me-it had to be someone from the other side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They held back from admitting it, worried that saying too much might expose who they really were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, deep down, they both were sure those people hadn&#39;t shown up by chance. They were the targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re hurt. Let me take you to the hospital,&#34; Colton said as his eyes landed on the red scrapes scattered across Grace&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t deep, but they stood out-and for some reason, that made him feel strangely unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the southern faction, he fully intended to make them pay for it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. I&#39;m a doctor. I&#39;ll clean it up and apply some ointment at home.&#34; Unfortunately, she hadn&#39;t brought any of her medicine today-if she had, the wounds would&#39;ve started healing within hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was already in a bad mood, and the thought of her mother seeing the scrapes and getting all worried only made it worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fists slightly. She would never let go of the attackers from the northern faction. This wouldn&#39;t be forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Colton gave her just one firm word before pulling out his phone and calling Dominick to come pick them up and head to the nearest hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, the assistant showed up almost instantly,proving that Colton was even more capable than she&#39;d guessed, with a sharp, well-prepared team always at his side.</p>
