                <p>Colton&#39;s eyes gleamed with a sharp chill that cut through the air like a blade. &#34;If anyone here still has more to say, don&#39;t mind me. Keep going. Or I can step out until the whispering ends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room thickened as the pressure he radiated seemed to suffocate everyone at once. &#34;Y-you&#39;ve got it wrong. We didn&#39;t say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boldness they&#39;d shown earlier had completely vanished. Each man was now silent, head lowered in guilt or fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton rested his fingers on the table, tapping rhythmically. Each sound landed like a warning shot,echoing through the heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crooked smile appeared on his face, cold and void of warmth. &#34;You&#39;re getting on in years. Maybe it&#39;s time to stay home.Grandma enjoys peace. Let&#39;s not disrupt that unless absolutely necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the same men who lined their pockets with dividends, only to whisper venom behind his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once had they been grateful to the source of their wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Colton spoke, their expressions soured, but none dared to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he hadn&#39;t told them directly to leave, the message was painfully clear. Still, no one had the courage to push back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After delivering his final jab, Colton turned and went to find Isabella.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You scoundrel. Took you long enough to show your face,&#34; Isabella chided affectionately, her deep red dress highlighting the bright green of the emerald at her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she smiled, the thought that she might outlive her grandson cast a quiet shadow across her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l&#39;ve been meaning to come. Things have just been hectic,&#34; Colton said, settling beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hectic, always hectic. I&#39;m not young anymore, Colton.All I want now is to see you happy, married, with children of your own,&#34; she said, exhaling a wistful breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still in your prime. When I have kids, you&#39;ll be right here spoiling them.&#34; He laughed gently, not mentioning Dr. Q.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some things were better kept secret, at least for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope so. But how have you been feeling? You look much better.&#34; Isabella observed him closely, noting the healthy color in his face, and felt a quiet sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m doing fine, really. You don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. Oh, and about Harry...I may be old and out of theloop, but if he crosses the line, you have every right to deal with him. Don&#39;t hold back on my account,&#34; she said knowingly, her insight still sharp despite rarely leaving the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; understand, Grandma. I know what to do,&#34;Colton assured her with quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the day of exams at Briskvale High arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Grace&#39;s first since changing schools, and Julia treated it like a milestone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, Julia gently pulled Grace aside and gave her a pep talk.&#34;Sweetheart, don&#39;t be nervous. No matter how it goes, you&#39;ll always be my precious girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace smiled calmly. &#34;It&#39;ll be fine, Mom. I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll do okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny couldn&#39;t resist. &#34;You sound pretty full of yourself.What if you flop? That would be awkward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia narrowed her eyes at him. &#34;Watch it. If your scores drop, you&#39;ll be hearing from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Mom! I&#39;m your real son. Don&#39;t I deserve a little more love?&#34; Johnny whined,feigning heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obvious double standards once again-on full display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I care about is seeing my darling girl happy.&#34; Julia chuckled, unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Gianna had just set down her spoon,lips tightly sealed. Jealousy simmered just beneath her skin. Why was Julia so affectionate toward Grace?More so than she ever was with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s grip tightened on her backpack strap, her nails digging into the soft flesh of her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a cheerful tone, she spoke up. &#34;Aunt Julia, we should probably head out now. We&#39;ll be late for the exam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapped from her moment of doting, Julia nodded and gently straightened Grace&#39;s collar. &#34;Gianna&#39;s right. It&#39;s time. Do your best out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek black Maybach glided out of the driveway without a hitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Johnny threw a sharp glance at Grace through the rearview mirror and snorted. &#34;Let&#39;s just hope no one tarnishes the family&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Grace had once stepped in to help him,he still couldn&#39;t bring himself to be grateful. He felt she had overstepped her bounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been eager to be Beatrice&#39;s knight in shining armor, but Grace had stolen the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had feelings for Beatrice, always had. And ever since that incident, she&#39;d started showing signs of liking him back. Things between them were getting playfully romantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Grace casually flipped through a worn-out notebook, her eyes never leaving the pages as she said, &#34;Relax. I&#39;m not scoring lower than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny spun around so fast he nearly launched himself over the front seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before things escalated, Gianna cut in, trying to keep the peace. &#34;Johnny, Grace just joined us. It&#39;s already impressive she&#39;s managing so well...&#34; Then her eyes caught the battered notebook in Grace&#39;s lap. &#34;But Grace, that doesn&#39;t look like proper revision material.I could share my notes with you. They&#39;re all organized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace finally raised her head, her voice as even as her gaze. &#34;Thanks, but this is enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the worn pages were names and sketches of rare herbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had decided to use her spare time to plan a small medicinal garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the exam center, the atmosphere buzzed with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a series of major exams, and everyone was placed in random seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most students fidgeted with nerves, but Grace stood quietly, unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others misread her calm as defeat, assuming she had no expectations because she knew she&#39;d end up at the bottom anyway.</p>
