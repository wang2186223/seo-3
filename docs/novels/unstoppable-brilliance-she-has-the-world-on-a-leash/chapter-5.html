                <p>Briskvale High sat at the pinnacle of local education,famous for having some of the toughest entrance requirements in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout its long and storied history, the school had never once accepted a transfer student, let alone welcomed someone who had once dropped out of school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s place at Briskvale had been earned through relentless effort, bolstered by her family background and stellar track record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a sidelong glance at Grace, Gianna sneered to herself as she watched the girl quietly savor her soup.Did this orphan honestly believe she could just stroll into a place like Briskvale High?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the brightest and most ambitious students filled those halls, and nearly every graduate went on to attend a top university.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admitting someone who once dropped out of school?That would be an outright scandal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, the school wouldn&#39;t risk its legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Julia...&#34;&#39; Gianna put on a show of concern. &#34;I heard Grace didn&#39;t have the best grades back in her hometown...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her words hang in the air, eyes glittering with barely disguised mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia took her time serving Grace another bowl of soup,her smile warm and reassuring. &#34;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Rodger donated an entire building to the school. The principal believes every student deserves a fair chance, so Grace is welcome to join.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Gianna forced a worried expression, her jaw clenched tight. &#34;I&#39;m only looking out for Grace.We had another student once who bought his way in,but he could not keep up and ended up having a tough time. The pressure pushed him into depression.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of anyone at school linking her to Grace made Gianna bristle with embarrassment. She would never allow Grace to attend the same school as her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Rodger&#39;s features grew thoughtful,a hint of concern surfacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t fully considered the challenges Grace might face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked over at Grace, her wide and innocent eyes were fixed on him. That sweet look tugged at his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>heartstrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace.&#34; Rodger spoke in a softer tone than usual.&#34;If you ever feel overwhelmed, we can look into other schools. I&#39;ve made donations to plenty of them...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her spoon down with a quiet clink, Grace met his gaze. &#34;There&#39;s no need to worry,&#34; she replied softly. &#34;If you believe Briskvale High is the right place,then I&#39;ll go. And just so you know, I&#39;m not as hopeless as everyone thinks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something warm bloomed in Rodger&#39;s chest. How did he end up with a daughter so sensible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether she was brilliant or not meant little to him-the family&#39;s fortune could give her a life of comfort forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he wanted was to shield her from disappointment and give her every chance to be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger looked at Grace with a gentleness rarely seen in him. &#34;All your mom and I wish for is that you find happiness and fulfillment in your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sort of gentleness was a side he reserved only for his wife and now for his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Gianna&#39;s grip on her fork tightened so much her knuckles blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Rodger and Julia were too impulsive and naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Briskvale High their private place, letting in anyone they pleased as if it belonged to them? Such stupidity was hard to stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, Gianna believed,reality would come crashing down on Grace the moment she set foot inside the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Schemes for making Grace&#39;s life miserable were already swirling in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe I can handle it,&#34; Grace replied, a hint of calm resting on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s eyes softened further as he retrieved a slim black card from his pocket. &#34;Here, Grace. There&#39;s no limit on this card. Get yourself whatever you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole room seemed to pause, the air growing thick with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes settled on Rodger and Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That card wasn&#39;t just a credit card-it was a black card,a symbol of privilege so rare that only a handful existed in the entire world. In the city, maybe two or three people possessed one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Rodger truly thinking straight? Gianna nearly shattered her fork in disbelief, her anger boiling just beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To hand over such a symbol of status to a newly adopted girl felt unfathomable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping her gaze, Grace let her lashes flicker as she studied the card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized it immediately. A nearly identical one sat quietly at her purse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet something in Rodger&#39;s expression made her accept it wvithout hesitation, her slender fingers curling around the card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Dad.&#34; Her voice was soft, and she traced the edge of the card with delicate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna watched, her jaw clenched tight, believing Grace was putting on a show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger, his face now softened with rare warmth,added quietly, &#34;Let me know if you need anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he added, &#34;Tomorrow, why don&#39;t you head out and pick up some new clothes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Grace slipped the card into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Gianna glared at that simple bag,her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>jealousy burning so hot she could hardly sit still.</p>
