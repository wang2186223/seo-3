                <p>Life in Beatrice&#39;s household was a constant struggle;money slipped through their fingers and trouble wNas never far behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her striking looks and talent for reinventing herself ensured that no one ever looked down upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To be told to get out of someone&#39;s house was an insult she could hardly process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding Julia so unyielding-willing to kick her out over an adopted child-struck Beatrice as both outrageous and deeplyembarrassing. The thought of leaving in disgrace, only for Grace to broadcast her downfall at school, sent a chill down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to go quietly, she clung to the hope that Gianna&#39;s voice might sway Julia&#39;s decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Julia paid no heed to Gianna&#39;s pleas. Her patience with Gianna had thinned,and her resolve hardened. No matter what, she would not forgive the girl who had hurt her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could all of this be a simple accident...&#34; Julia started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Ethel-already frail these days-was overcome by the rising tension in the room and collapsed before anyone could react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic shot through the gathering. &#34;Mom, what&#39;s happening? Why did you pass out so suddenly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, please wake up! Don&#39;t scare us like this!&#34;shouted Gianna, rushing to her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos swept through the halls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Eliana dialed both the ambulance service and the family doctor. Gianna and Beatrice instantly dissolved into tears, putting on a synchronized show of worry and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire remained rooted to the spot, utterly lost about how to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the midst of the chaos, Julia urged Grace to tend to Ethel. Gianna stepped in to block her,fully aware that Ethel had no patience for anyone without proper medical credentials-she only placed her trust in professionals. Grace, lacking any formal background,would never be permitted to lay a hand on Ethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s confidence was unshakable: even if Ethel regained consciousness, she would surely take her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stroke of luck placed the family doctor just minutes away. Arriving in record time, he kept Grace at a distance and immediately set to work. &#34;Mrs. Holden&#39;s health issues are longstanding. It appears her blood pressure was left unchecked, causing a blockage and this fainting spell. She&#39;ll wake up soon. But for her safety, she needs a full examination at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over the room at the doctor&#39;s verdict.Within moments, the family began ushering Ethel out for urgent care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each member of the Holden family trailed after her,leaving Beatrice-always on the periphery-to quietly make her exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before slipping away, she took a moment to hiss at Grace, who was walking alone, saying, &#34;Grace, do you see how it is? You&#39;ll always be on the outside.Don&#39;t get too comfortable. They might toss you aside just as easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate the heads-up,&#34; replied Grace with a light laugh. &#34;Maybe you&#39;re rightabout tomorrow, but right now, I have everything I need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing her sparkling bracelet, she breezed past Beatrice, linking arms with Julia and nestling close in a show of intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long since mastered the art of provoking jealousy in others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she expected, a quick look over her shoulder revealed Beatrice&#39;s cheeks burning with rage. That bitter expression filled her with a dark sort of delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the Holden family gathered quietly in the hospital corridor while Ethel underwent her series of medical tests. Being the primary donors of this elite private hospital ensured Ethel skipped the usual queues and received immediate care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, her trusted doctor appeared to share the results. &#34;Mrs. Holden&#39;s condition is fairly typical among seniors. It&#39;s a cardiovascular issue, but there&#39;s no reason to panic. With medication, it should remain under control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words brought visible relief to the anxious family members-after all, such health problems were to be expected in someone of Ethel&#39;s age.Consistent medication and check-ups would likely keep things in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the blue, Grace spoke up. &#34;That&#39;s not the whole story. Her situation is much more critical than you think. Medications and routine visits won&#39;t be enough. If nothing changes now, she could suffer a stroke, paralysis, or even a heart attack in less than three months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze, her grave warning sending a collective chill through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna was quick to lash out. &#34;Grace, don&#39;t talk nonsense! Grandma will recover just fine. Do you even realize how ominous that sounds?&#34; Tears streaming down her cheeks as she ramped up the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sophia Holden, Carl&#39;s elegantly dressed wife, joined the chorus with a scowl. &#34;Who let this girl in here,cursing Ethel with talk of death? Where&#39;s her respect?&#34; Her voice and posture were as fierce as her flashy jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t misunderstand Grace,&#34; Julia replied,rushing to shield her. &#34;She&#39;s only concerned for Ethel&#39;s health and spoke from the heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, Grace&#39;s background set her apart-raised under the state&#39;s watchful eye and shaped by a rigorous elite program, she never really learned the everyday warmth that came from family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking to bridge that gap, officials arranged for her to live with adoptive parents and discover what home life meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, Grace became more open and approachable, though she still had a ways to go before fully fitting in.</p>
