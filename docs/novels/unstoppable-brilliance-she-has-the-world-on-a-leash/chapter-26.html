                <p>Days slipped by, and soon the weekend brought the long-awaited socialite event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement buzzed in the air as the big gathering finally drew near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though they weren&#39;t expected at the venue until later in the day, both Grace and Gianna woke up with the sun, eager to begin their preparations. A full morning of dressing and styling awaited them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After washing up, Grace made her way to her closet, ready to pull out her gown and plan out her morning routine with hair and makeup following breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she swung open the wardrobe doors,her eyes went straight to a glaring problem.The hem of her stunning gown, once flawless, was now ripped unevenly, as though someone had slashed it with something sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands stilled on the fabric, and a frown creased her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment settled in her chest; the culprit was painfully obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small, resigned smile, she ran her fingers across the ruined edge. &#34;How childish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s knock echoed through the room at that moment. &#34;Grace, are you up yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swinging the door open with the dress in hand, Grace greeted her. &#34;Morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning, honey. Come downstairs for breakf-&#34; Julia&#39;s words faded as her gaze landed on the ruined gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, shock kept her silent. Hurrying over, she examined the damage. &#34;Howdid this happen? Was it just an accident? Let me call the boutique and see if they can do an urgent repair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a quiet shake of her head.&#34;There&#39;s not enough time for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of worry crossed Julia&#39;s face. &#34;So what are we supposed to do? I should have had a second dress ready foryou.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, footsteps sounded on the stairs,and Gianna appeared, a mask of concern plastered on her face. &#34;Grace, aren&#39;t you getting ready? The stylist will arrive any minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked to the shredded gown, and Gianna put on a show of shock. &#34;Oh no,how did this happen? Did someone from the staff ruin it by mistake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, she deflected responsibility toward the household staff. A brief glint of smugness flashed in her eyes, barely concealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Grace&#39;s gown was in tatters, what would she possibly do for the big night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching eagerly, Gianna waited to see how Grace could ever hope to outshine her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Julia&#39;s nerves frayed at the edges. Her daughter&#39;s first appearance in high society could not be ruined by something like this. &#34;This is a disaster, and there&#39;s hardly any time left!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound genuinely helpful, Gianna chimed in, &#34;Aunt Julia, please don&#39;t be upset.My closet is full of gowns, and most of them have only seen the light of day once. If nothing else works, let&#39;s pick one out for Grace to wear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia pressed her lips together, mulling over the suggestion. Borrowing Gianna&#39;s old dress was not her first choice, but with the clock ticking, it might be the only solution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Grace remained unruffled. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. I&#39;ve got it covered. Mom, do we still have a sewing kit in the house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia nodded at once and asked a servant to bring it upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded her face. &#34;What do you want it for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take care of the repair myself,&#34; Grace answered with quiet certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, thedamage had spared most of the gown, tearing only at the hem and making it less of a challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sewing kit opened with a snap. Grace found the scissors and, without hesitation,trimmed away the ruined section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock registered on Gianna&#39;s face. Was Grace actually serious? How could she think she could handle such a delicate repair alone? This wasn&#39;t just any dress-it was a custom creation from Maison Blanche,and she intended to fix it as if it were an ordinary frock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to disguise her scorn, Gianna warned,&#34;Grace, tonight&#39;s gathering is the real deal.All the most polished young women will be there in designer gowns. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t make any rash changes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That midnight blue dress was no ordinary gown-it was a coveted Maison Blanche original, instantly recognized among the city&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely glancing up, Grace replied coolly, &#34;I&#39;m not interested in wearing someone else&#39;s hand-me-downs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna recoiled at the remark, her mood turning sour. &#34;At least borrowing a dress would be better than showing up in something you butchered,&#34; she replied,forcing a grin as she tried to hide her glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered what kind of disaster Grace&#39;s patchwork solution would become. Pulling it off seemed impossible for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting Grace&#39;s gaze, Gianna quickly glanced away. &#34;I was only trying to help lf you&#39;re set on doing it alone, that&#39;s your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;ve got spare time, perhaps you should figure ouut how the gown ended up damaged in the first place. It was kept at home, after all,&#34; Grace remarked coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy chill crept through Gianna;suspicion flickered in her mind that Grace knew more than she let on. No words came from her after that. She kept her thoughts to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, trust me. I&#39;m going to make it look even better,&#34; Grace said to Julia, her voice full of assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing an eye roll, Gianna bit back a retort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a boast! Make it better? How did she manage to sound so sure of herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eagerness bubbled within Gianna, certain Grace would embarrass herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Julia and Gianna watched closely as Grace took up her needle and thread,settling on the edge of the bed. Swvift hands set to work, stitching with surprising skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes passed, and Grace reappeared, now dressed in the restored gown. Julia and Gianna stared in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hem, once ruined, had been masterfully reshaped into an asymmetric cut, the former rip now embellished with delicate sparkling diamonds. As Grace moved, the tiny stones shimmered like stardust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No hint of damage remained. If anything, the dress had never looked so exquisite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s eyes flew wide, and her fingers pressed sharp crescents into her palms.Never in her wildest dreams did she expect Grace to pull off something so creative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pure delight shone from Julia&#39;s face as she took Grace&#39;s hand. &#34;Oh, dear, you&#39;ve outdone yourself! This is even lovelier than it was before!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeniably, the gown&#39;s transformation perfectly matched Grace&#39;s poise and beauty.</p>
