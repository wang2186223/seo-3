                <p>Everyone just froze, eyes wide. They were still processing the fact that Grace was Terry&#39;s mentor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terry&#39;s reputation stretched far and wide. A brilliant mind, the kind you read about in the papers, with a squad of bodyguards sent straight from the top brass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that such an important figure, the sort the government kept under lock and key so rival nations wouldn&#39;t take him, had once learned from a teenager,felt almost like a practical joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life, though, loved to serve up stories that made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace herself was a hidden treasure, her talents handpicked and shaped by people in high places. For her, mastering any art was effortless, and hacking came as easily as breathing. Computer code was nothing more than a playground for her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before anyone had heard of Terry, he trailed after Grace, eager for her advice and direction.Every bit of his present-day glory traced back to those early days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first time he saw Grace, his jaw dropped. He reacted just the same way as everyone else noW-utterly shocked and in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He no longer found any of this surprising. In fact,he&#39;d traveled here for Grace alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, he had figured that tracking her down again would be a real ordeal, but instead, Grace showed up at the school herself and dashed off a research paper without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her seemingly offhand effort was anything but simple. Layers of meaning and clever observations ran through every paragraph, sparking revelations for anyone sharp enough to catch them. Terry knew at once that this piece was nothing short of extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for the ignorant people, he would have never dreamed of letting such brilliance go public on a mere forum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could count on one hand the number of people who, like Grace, had earned the title of prodigy in both artificial intelligence and hacking before hitting twenty. There had only ever been three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first hailed from the influential Pearson family,the second led the Clark household, and then there was Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among these celebrated minds, Grace held the distinction of being the youngest, a record nobody had managed to surpass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm yet unwavering voice, she said, &#34;Prof.Warren, you have my apologies, but I do not wish to join your team, and I am not seeking a recommendation to Summit University.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attending this school served a dual purpose for Grace: keeping her true intentions hidden from the watchful eyes of the southern faction and, even more importantly, honoring her parents&#39; wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia and Rodger, wanting nothing but the best for her,encouraged her to focus on her studies here. To respect them, she remained for a while longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already holding two postdoctoral degrees, Grace saw little value in treading the same academic ground, planning instead to move on and chase after new ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That blunt rejection hit Gianna like a cold shock,slicing through her composure and leaving her stunned. It stung all the more because everything she craved seemed to come so effortlessly to Grace,who appeared utterly indifferent to those very things.Each word felt like another blow to her pride, leaving a heavy ache in its wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I would never presume to ask you to join my team as a student,&#34; explained Terry, his voice filled with a nervous hopefulness. &#34;Actually, I was hoping you might serve as an advisor, share you wisdom with us when you have the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone witnessing the scene could only gape,astonished by the reversal: Terry&#39;s respectful plea,and Grace&#39;s cool detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with such a golden chance handed to her,Grace remained unmoved. She responded once more, &#34;That does not interest me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was already set on more pressing matters,including tracking down the elusive &#34;Devil&#34; working for the northern faction-a task that left no room for distractions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing even a junior spot in Terry&#39;s team was enough to keep most students up all night, lost in wild hopes and anticipation. However,Grace viewed the very thought as a headache waiting to happen,sidestepping it as if it were a trap laid in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Grace brush off such a rare invitation sent Gianna&#39;s temper soaring. Ellie, meanwhile, could barely contain her distress, her breath shallow with regret for scorning Grace before. Cursing her own actions, she realized she&#39;d sabotaged any chance of joining the elite teaching ranks herself-leaving Anthony to claim the prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed by Grace&#39;s steady refusals, Terry tried once more, saying, &#34;I promise we won&#39;t burden you. You could come by when you wish, and offer guidance only if you&#39;re in the mood. Would that be acceptable?&#34; His persistence was nothing short of relentless, unwavering in his hope to win Grace over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gradually, the audience transitioned from begrudging acceptance to something closer to resignation, their spirits dulled by the back-and-forth between Terry&#39;s respect and Grace&#39;s cool indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite heading a lab at the highest echelon of national research, Terry found himself rejected time after time by Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation shocked everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all those watching, only Gianna seemed truly bitter about Grace&#39;s dismissal. Many of the students,who had once dismissed Grace as a nobody,now found themselves quietly in awe, their attitudes shifting toward admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Grace paid no mind to the crowd&#39;s shifting moods. After weighing her options, she finally gave a small, resigned nod and responded,&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing any longer, especially after Terry&#39;s very public request, felt almost inappropriate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she chose to treat the whole thing as a small service for her homeland, a favor she could grant with minimal fuss.</p>
