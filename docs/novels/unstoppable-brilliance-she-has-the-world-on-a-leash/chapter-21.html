                <p>Gianna chimed in with extra sweetness, flashing her lashes at Julia, &#34;Aunt Julia, Grandma asked me to care for you. She says you could use a bit of pampering while you&#39;re under the weather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick, pointed look from Gianna landed on Grace,clearly hinting that Grace had no idea how to be a caring daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a lighthearted air, Grace grabbed a sandwich,waving it right under Gianna&#39;s nose and letting a grin bloom across her face. &#34;What a shame for you.Nobody makes sandwiches like my mom does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first bite sent her eyes fluttering closed in pleasure. &#34;This is exactly how a sandwich should taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing such genuine delight, Julia&#39;s face brightened with laughter. &#34;Like it that much? There&#39;s plenty more in the kitchen if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, Julia&#39;s sandwiches only appealed to Rodger.Her sons barely gave them a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the heartwarming exchange, Gianna clenched her fist, so lost in envy that she barely With her hunger gone, Grace gently let her fingertips rest on Julia&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern settled over her features. Agentle frown formed as she felt Julia&#39;s faint, unsteady pulse.Her health seemed worse than Grace expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Julia asked with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling her hand away, Grace muttered, &#34;Just checking your pulse. I once read a book that taught me how to assess someone&#39;s health just by feeling their pulse.Mom,from what I observed, you&#39;re low on energy right now. Please take it easy and keep warm. No overdoing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s pride shone through her eyes, and her whole face lit up. &#34;I always knew you were something special,honey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching out, she pinched her daughter&#39;s cheek and gave her the warmest smile. &#34;Who needs a clinic? I&#39;ve got my own doctor right here at home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle happiness bubbled up in Grace, and she couldn&#39;t hide her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, she took pride in what she could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her purse and produced a small sky-blue bottle patterned with tiny flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are some energy-boosting supplements |mixed up myself,&#34; said Grace, handing Julia the bottle.&#34;Just take one every day, like it&#39;s candy. They&#39;ll help boost your energy and keep you looking beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Julia&#39;s curiosity as she eyed the bottle, Grace explained, &#34;Every ingredient is natural and lab-approved, so you won&#39;t have any side effects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement bubbling inside, Julia twisted open the cap without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle snap released a breeze of calming fragrance.The scent instantly brightened the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a one-of-a-kind aroma!&#34; Julia said, taking a long,satisfied breath. &#34;Just smelling it makes me feel better already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s eyes sparkled, teasing, &#34;There are some rare herbs in there you&#39;ll never find on a grocery shelf.&#34;She kept quiet about her own homegrown botanicals, ones hardly anyone else could get their hands on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That secret mix had come straight from her personal garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One pill landed in Julia&#39;s palm, gleaming like a tiny pearl. She tossed it in her mouth right away, her eyes shining. &#34;It tastes sweet! And there&#39;s this minty,refreshing kick to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the honey and mint I added to make it taste good,&#34; Grace explaiend, pleased by Julia&#39;s reaction.Her heart warmed at the sight of Julia enjoying it so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it!&#34; Julia&#39;s voice rang with the delight of a child finding a treasure. &#34;I already feel more lively, and my skin&#39;s so soft.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran her hand across her cheek, marveling at how smooth it felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle laugh escaped Grace. &#34;It&#39;s not going to work that quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve actually mixed up special supplements for Dad and the boys too. Each one is meant to help with their stress and energy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she became part of the Holden family, she had paid close attention to everyone&#39;s health, quietly making supplements that suited their needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia stared, taking in the moment. Grace&#39;s thoughtful ways left an impression. There was no stopping the fondness she felt for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot on the couch, Gianna finally lost her patience. &#34;Grace, you can&#39;t just dish out homemade pills. We&#39;ve got a family doctor for a reason. If Aunt Julia&#39;s sick, she knows who to call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze fixed on the small bottle, a knot of envy tightening in her chest. How could Grace play doctor like this? Did she actually believe she was some kind of healer? None of these homemade remedies or pulse checks had ever come up before-not in this house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Gianna, the whole performance seemed absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sure this was Grace&#39;s way of charming Rodger and Julia, and that was why they spoiled her. Such a suck-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a glance in Gianna&#39;s direction,Grace replied, &#34;Just wait and see. The results will speak for themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, chilly laugh escaped Gianna.&#34;Oh, I&#39;m dying to see how that turns out.&#34; She let every syllable drip with sarcasm. &#34;I really hope you can make her better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, Gianna had done her homework on Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life with the Millers had branded Grace as unremarkable. Now she was strutting around like she could cure patients?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna couldn&#39;t believe anyone took her seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Gianna&#39;s outburst, Grace stayed silent.Proving someone wrong was better than arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia soon looped Grace into a lighter conversation,leaving the tension behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bored, Gianna spoke up. &#34;I&#39;ll go unpack my things now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a strained grin, she excused herself from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile faded the second her back was turned,replaced by a steely, plotting glare.</p>
