                <p>After having her scrapes patched up at the hospital,Grace ducked into the restroom for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ready to rejoin Colton and leave, she spun on her heel, only to hear a voice she recognized instantly,thick with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace! Oh, my darling! Are you alright? I was worried sick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia&#39;s sudden appearance left Grace momentarily stunned. The evidence of her mother&#39;s sobbing was unmistakable-red, swollen eyes and an emotional disarray that spoke of minutes spent weeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing close by, Rodger looked equally stricken,anxiety carved into every line of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace tried to offer a reassuring smile. &#34;I&#39;m okay,really.How did you find me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could we not come the minute we heard about your car accident? It terrified us! I can&#39;t tell you how relieved I am to see you safe!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just hearing the news of Grace&#39;s crash had nearly sent Julia into a faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears glimmered as Julia scanned Grace from head to toe, unable to hide her distress at the sight of those shallow, red marks on her daughter&#39;s skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, honestly, it&#39;s nothing-just a few scratches,&#34;Grace assured her gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s concern deepened as he pressed the issue.&#34;Are you absolutely certain? I really think it&#39;s best for you to get a thorough examination. Sometimes injuries hide beneath the surface and only reveal themselves much later. What if something starts bothering you after we&#39;ve already left? That&#39;s what worries me the most.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nodding vigorously, Julia echoed his concern. &#34;He&#39;s absolutely right! Let&#39;s have a doctor check you out from head to toe right away,&#34; she insisted. Any amount of waiting or extra cost was a small price for knowing Grace was truly alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for his phone, Rodger was ready to call a doctor, but Grace reached out and stopped him in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need to worry, really-I know my own health better than anyone. Don&#39;t forget, medicine is my field,&#34; she insisted with a gentle but confident smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To prove her point, she spun around lightly and even bounced on her toes, almost daring them to doubt her flexibility and strength. She looked like she might break into a cartwheel any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her liveliness finally eased some of their worry.Julia&#39;s tension faded just a bit, though she still clung to her motherly concern. &#34;I should have come to fetch you myself. It&#39;s too risky for someone your age to go home by yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment almost made Grace laugh. In truth, she was probably the last person in the world who needed protecting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching gears, she threw out a question to shift the conversation. &#34;So tell me-how did you two know to find me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia, easily sidetracked, started to answer. But before she could finish, Colton made his entrance,freshly bandaged from his own treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Colton!&#34; Julia blurted out in relief. &#34;He told me what happened-if not for him, I&#39;d have had no idea where to look. You really gave me a scare this time,sweetheart...&#34; Her voice shook, threatening tears all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Grace&#39;s face. What business did Colton have talking with her parents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elite families often crossed paths, sharing connections through business, tradition, or even arranged marriages-none of that was out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Grace eyed Colton warily, unable to shake a wave of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a look of harmless innocence, Colton explained, &#34;While you were tending to your cuts,your mom&#39;s calls kept lighting up your phone. I went ahead and answered, thinking she&#39;d want to know what was going on.&#34; He glanced over, his face full of apology. &#34;Honestly, I wasn&#39;t snooping.I just thought it&#39;d be worse not to answer her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia broke into a bright smile, brushing off any concern. &#34;No need to say sorry! Without your help,we&#39;d never have known about the accident. If anything,I&#39;m grateful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace could only sigh, lips curving into a faint,bewildered smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet tone, she leaned closer to Colton and whispered, &#34;Did you really have to tell my mom?I was on my way home anyway-she wouldn&#39;t have found out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Telling her parents had never been part of the plan.Grace intended to slip home quietly, dab on her own custom ointment, and wake up the next morning with barely a mark left behind. No one would have guessed a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh escaped Colton as he leaned closer,lowering his voice to a private whisper. &#34;I thought it&#39;d be nice if your folks realized you and I... share a connection. Who knows, maybe you&#39;ll give me a proper introduction soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stared, taken aback. &#34;Wait-what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; The families were familiar with each other already, so what was the point in introducing him to her folks?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Julia took in the sight of Grace and Colton murmuring together and saw something entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Rodger a nudge, whispering,&#34;Honey,look at those two... Aren&#39;t they just perfect? They seem so close-maybe there&#39;s already something going on between them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fierce blush shot across Grace&#39;s cheeks.&#34;Mom!It&#39;s not like that. We&#39;re not dating!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s posture stiffened at once, concern flickering in his eyes. &#34;That&#39;s right. Girls your age shouldn&#39;t be thinking about romance just yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton could hardly hide his amusement as the scene played out. Everything was falling neatly into place. Instead of bristling at Rodger&#39;s sternness, he wore a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a point, Mr. Holden. Grace should be focused on life&#39;s bigger adventures before she even considers dating.&#34;</p>
