                <p>&#34;What? What are you talking about?&#34; Ryan blinked,clearly confused, unable to grasp Colton&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the top genius secretly trained by the southern faction,&#34; Colton explained, his tone unusually patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his immense wealth and privately trained forces, the upper ranks of the nation were beyond his reach. No matter how powerful he became, he still couldn&#39;t override the authority of the state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the highest powers had to answer to justice-at least in theory. But beneath that official surface, the reality was far more complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as Colton was concerned, the national leadership was secretly split into two rival factions-northern and southern-both claiming to serve the country,yet constantly engaged in a covert power struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton belonged to the northern faction. He had been nurtured by its leader, a connection that had elevated both his influence and theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Colton rose in strength, the northern faction&#39;s hold on power deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two years ago, Colton had completed a high-stakes mission to dismantle a massive drug cartel. He captured the kingpin alive, securing a critical victory for the northern faction-one that decisively outshone the southern faction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the success came at a steep cost. During the operation, Colton had been poisoned with a rare and lethal toxin that nearly claimed his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The incident almost shattered the northern faction&#39;s dominance. Yet, against the odds, they held their ground and continued to lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the aftermath, rumors began to circulate. Word reached Colton that the southern faction had quietly cultivated a top-tier genius-someone unmatched in hacking, combat, business strategy, and other elite skills. Her intellect was said to be extraordinary, her versatility beyond belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,everything about her was sealed in secrecy.This so-called genius-engineered and nurtured by the nation itself-was a ghost. Not even Colton could uncover any concrete details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one fact had been confirmed: she was female.Her name, her age, her face-none of it was known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that searching,all those dead ends-Colton figured it was time he handled things personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,the southern faction finally has something worth showing off,&#34; Ryan said, brow tightening in thought.&#34;That genius of theirs might even be able to match you. No wonder they&#39;ve had such a string of victories lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her age and identity remain a mystery,&#34; Colton said coolly. &#34;Uncovering her will take time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It explained everything-the southern faction&#39;s rapid advancements in the past two years. Their foreign intelligence network, military breakthroughs, and talent development likely all stemmed from her efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman&#39;s efforts were probably the cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she&#39;s an elderly woman. From there, we could begin the hunt,&#34; Ryan conjectured once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geniuses like Colton-those who rose to legendary status at a young age-were exceedingly rare. If that female genius was truly a woman of such remarkable capabilities, then she likely wasn&#39;t young either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, how else could she have cultivated such a formidable skill set?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not necessarily,&#34; Colton replied, his voice cold and razor-sharp. &#34;I will find her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then it&#39;s clear-you&#39;ve gained a formidable enemy,&#34;Ryan said, his tone sobering. &#34;Unless you completely sever ties with the northern faction, you&#39;ll have no choice but to defeat that woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she remained unchecked, the hardline elders of the southern faction would never give up their pursuit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though both factions claimed loyalty to the nation,their clashing philosophies and cutthroat competition often turned them into enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s out of the picture,&#34; Colton said flatly. &#34;And I&#39;ll walk away from the northern faction.&#34;His eyes, deep and impenetrable, revealed nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Colton, neither the female genius nor the political factions held any real significance. They didn&#39;t stir his emotions. They didn&#39;t even register.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He absently tapped his fingers on the tabletop-a quiet, rhythmic sound that only intensified the oppressive stillness hanging in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason he hadn&#39;t cut ties yet was simple-leaving now would ruin the fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton thrived in the shadows. Why not go all in this time? Let them tear each other apart while he watched from the sidelines. Now that would be entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the room had grown oppressively heavy. Dominick didn&#39;t dare make a sound-he didn&#39;t even breathe too loudly, quietly standing by, waiting for instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the shift in mood, and realizing the topic had been thoroughly dissected, Ryan pivoted-slipping back into his usual lighthearted tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way,Colton, I really think it&#39;s great that you&#39;ve taken a liking to Miss Miller. She&#39;s quite the woman,&#34;Ryan said with a grin. &#34;Not only did she save your life,but she&#39;s incredibly skilled. She&#39;s got talent in stone gambling, probably aces every academic test, and always stays calm and sharp. Honestly, she&#39;s a perfect match for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, it all made sense to Ryan-why Colton gave Grace such special treatment. He clearly wanted to win her over and use her as a weapon against that mysterious genius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a brilliant strategy.Typical Colton-calculating,methodical,always three steps ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Colton arched a brow, expression unreadable.&#34;Did I ever say l intended to pursue her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you?&#34; Ryan pressed, still grinning. &#34;Why else would you treat her so well? Isn&#39;t it all part of the plan?Use her to eliminate that mysterious genius and bring</p>
                
                
                
                <p>down the northern faction in the process?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Grace was gorgeous, so it was the ideal plan,and there would be no loss!</p>
