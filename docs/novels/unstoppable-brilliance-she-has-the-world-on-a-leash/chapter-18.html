                <p>Grace was looking down at her phone and did not even lift her eyes when Demi spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flickered across Demi&#39;s face, though she forced a cheerful smile. &#34;Grace, honestly, these clothes aren&#39;t really your thing. Just a single top here costs morethan half a year&#39;s living expenses for most people. There&#39;s a budget-friendly outlet just behind the mall-maybe that&#39;s more your speed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi made her point clear by sipping slowly from her hot chocolate. Seeing Grace&#39;s discomfort seemed to make the drink all the sweeter for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Grace lifted her gaze. Her eyes glinted,cold and impenetrable, as she sized up Demi.&#34;Finished talking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling sweetly, Demi responded, &#34;Since we&#39;ve bumped into each other, let me grab you a drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll pass. I&#39;d rather not be part of your drama,&#34; Grace replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s face flushed with anger. Before she could retort, a group of girls walked by, their voices carrying</p>
                
                
                
                <p>over in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, look at that woman&#39;s white trench coat! Where do you think she bought it? She&#39;s stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Totally agree-the design looks so high-end,probably super expensive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True, especially compared to that tacky girl beside her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile curled on Grace&#39;s lips. She knew her coat wasn&#39;t just any white trench-it was a limited anniversary piece, the only one in existence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand drifted to smooth a wrinkle on the sleeve,the cashmere&#39;s subtle sheen glinting beneath the lights, revealing a hidden layer of luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simple and soft, that coat had always been a favorite,striking just the right balance between comfort and elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overhearing the whispers, Demi nearly lost her composure. Her fingers clenched so tightly around the cup of hot chocolate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glare followed the girls as they disappeared, her thoughts bubbling with annoyance at their so-called taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Students these days wouldn&#39;t know style if it tripped</p>
                
                
                
                <p>them,&#34; Demi snapped under her breath. &#34;Clearly, they can&#39;t spot real fashion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they seriously that blind? For all they knew,Grace&#39;s coat could have been bought on sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, nothing compared to the label stitched into her own designer outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, seeing Grace&#39;s effortless poise stoked her resentment until it threatened to spill over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to stumble, Demi tipped the hot chocolate right in Grace&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The liquid sailed through the air. It splattered dramatically across Grace&#39;s white coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, everything seemed to pause. Grace stared at the glaring stain as if the world had stopped turning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of triumph flickered in Demi&#39;s eyes,though she quickly hid it behind a gasp and a hand over her mouth.&#34;Oh my goodness, look what I&#39;ve done! Your coat is ruined. I&#39;m so sorry-it just slipped! I swear, it was an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching into her bag, she produced two hundred dollars and held it out. &#34;Here,take this. Buy yourself a fresh coat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Grace made no move to accept, Demi pushed further, asking, &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Not enough for you?I doubt you&#39;ve ever even handled this much cash before. Just take it and pick something from the outlet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s sense of superiority swelled. Nothing pleased her more than the thought of Grace brought down a notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she wanted now was to savor the sight of Grace finally humbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold glare, Grace swiftly grabbed the half cup of hot chocolate out of Demi&#39;s grip and tossed the drink straight into her startled face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drink drenched Demi&#39;s face, smearing her makeup and leaving her hair in dripping chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You little-!&#34; Demi screamed furiously, eyes blazing,her glare so intense it might have scorched Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ivy stepped briskly out of the fitting room,immediately spotting Grace&#39;s cold retaliation against her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush, she stormed across the store, her styled hair nearly unraveling in her agitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing herself between Demi and Grace, she thrust</p>
                
                
                
                <p>out a manicured hand, her bright red nails hovering dangerously close to Grace&#39;s nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked with indignation as she shouted,&#34;Grace, don&#39;t you have any manners? Why are you always going after Demi like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind her mother, Demi&#39;s eyes shimmered with well-timed tears. She stammered, &#34;It was my mistake,Mom.I accidentally messed up her coat and tried to make it right, but maybe she felt it didn&#39;t cover the cost...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace watched Demi&#39;s well-rehearsed performance with calm detachment. She cóuldn&#39;t help but think the world of acting would sorely miss such talent if she ever quit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there were awards for theatrics, Demi would sweep the ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if sensing Grace&#39;s internal amusement,lvy erupted even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked another two hundred dollars from her designer purse and threw it disdainfully toward Grace.&#34;How about now? Is that enough for your cheap coat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of emotion, Grace met her glare.&#34;Nowhere near enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned disbelief flashed across lvy&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get greedy! This is more than generous. You need to know when to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s tone was cold as she replied, &#34;This coat is from Aesthetic Atelier; it&#39;s called &#39;Nieve&#39;. It&#39;s an anniversary edition, one of a kind. All the money you&#39;ve got wouldn&#39;t buy a single thread.&#34;</p>
