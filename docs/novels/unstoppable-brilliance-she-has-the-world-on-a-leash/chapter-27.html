                <p>Stunned by the display, Julia could hardly believe her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet sense of admiration settled in. Her daughter was truly exceptional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a touch of makeup or a single accessory, Grace radiated an effortless,almost otherworldly elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching from the side, Gianna realized she had completely underestimated Grace&#39;s creative abilities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly, Grace admired her reflection and nodded in approval. &#34;I&#39;m all set. I&#39;ll take care of my hair and makeup later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tasks like this hardly fazed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You never cease to amaze me. You&#39;re such a wonderful surprise,&#34; Julia said, her face aglow with pride, grateful for a daughter so much like herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Gianna watched in silent agony, envy simmering just beneath her sweet facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand tightened around her dress, so fiercely that her knuckles paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, willing herself to appear pleasant. &#34;Grace, you have a real gift, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing out her words, she tried to sound helpful. &#34;Socialite events usually require a professional touch. Don&#39;t you want the stylist to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Grace pinned her hair up in the mirror,she answered with quiet confidence, &#34;I appreciate it, but nobody knows my look better than I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of helpless irritation settled over Gianna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In swift, practiced motions, Grace&#39;s slender hands twisted her hair into a chic bun,a few loose strands framing her face and adding a lively air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delight shone in Julia&#39;s eyes. &#34;You can even style your hair like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| learned by helping the girls at the orphanage with their hair,&#34; Grace replied lightly, lifting a brush and sweeping color across her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every move spoke of confidence, and soon her makeup looked as if it belonged on a magazine cover, enhancing every one of her striking features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of disbelief froze Gianna in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing unrefined about her now.How did she pick up all these skills?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her eyes to the pale yellow gown she wore, Gianna suddenly felt it looked shabby beside Grace&#39;s quiet sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on her that her own appearance needed a serious upgrade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking side by side with Grace meant all eyes would measure them, and she feared falling short in every comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration burned inside her, but she could do nothing about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get going,&#34; Julia said, checking the time and admiring Gianna and Grace.&#34;You both look absolutely beautiful today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a polite smile, Gianna kept her true feelings buried beneath the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to linger a step behind, she accepted that her first plan had failed-now it was time to try something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Climbing into the car, Gianna seized her chance and let her heel &#34;accidentally&#34; land on the hem of Grace&#39;s gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Triumph flashed in her eyes-until Grace turned with effortless poise, her gown swirling out of harm&#39;s way in a silken sweep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch your step, Gianna,&#34; Grace said,steadying her with a gentle hand and a cool,almost playful smile. &#34;Those designer shoes must have cost a fortune. It would be a pity to scuff them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of embarrassment crept up Gianna&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sent a withering glare at Grace&#39;s back,silently vowing, &#34;Just wait-once we&#39;re at the party, I&#39;ll see to it you&#39;re humiliated in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their car rolled smoothly through city streets, heading for the grand venue. Gianna never noticed the fleeting reflection in the window-Grace had caught every flicker of resentment in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Grace ignored petty slights. But when someone crossed the line, she knew exactly how to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the dazzling lobby of a five-star hotel,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the gathering was already underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Grace and Gianna arrived, the other socialites had settled in, greeting each other with effortless charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to avoid being measured against Grace, Gianna surged ahead, while Grace trailed behind at an easy, unhurried pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the elevator, Grace reached out to press the button when a familiar voice called out, &#34;Hold on,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, someone wearing a pink dress entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi had spent too much time fussing over her outfit and nearly convinced herself she&#39;d be late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luck seemed to be on her side-she hadn&#39;t missed a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the mirrored space, her gaze landed instantly on Grace, whose presence seemed to command the entire room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered across Demi&#39;s face,her eyes narrowing as she blurted out, &#34;Grace,what brings you here? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually attending the gathering!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace let out a sigh, wishing fate had spared her from bumping into Demi. Still, curiosity nudged at her. Since when did Demi move in these circles?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Grace didn&#39;t know was that the Miller family had pulled strings to ensure Demi&#39;s name was on the guest list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small smirk tugged at Grace&#39;s lips as she sized up Demi&#39;s ensemble. Every inch of Demi screamed brand obsession, as if her only goal was to remind everyone how expensive her taste was. That bright pink dress, festooned with designer logos,screamed for attention but fell miles short of true sophistication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief, chilly pause, Grace met her gaze. &#34;Is that a dog making all that noise?Sure sounds like one to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury flashed across Demi&#39;s face as she realized Grace was taunting her. &#34;Grace, can you stop being so nasty for once? You&#39;re unbelievably rude!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace chuckled lightly. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s just you. I didn&#39;t even notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really need a reality check. You don&#39;t belong in this world-orphans aren&#39;t welcome here,&#34; Demi retorted, bristling with resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How thick-skinned could Grace be to show up here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to drag Grace down, Demi promised herself she&#39;d reveal her for who she truly was before the night ended.</p>
