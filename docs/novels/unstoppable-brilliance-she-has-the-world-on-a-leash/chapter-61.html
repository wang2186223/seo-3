                <p>Grace was momentarily caught off guard, then let out a soft chuckle, gracefully withdrawing her hand. &#34;Mr.Pearson, you&#39;re too generous. Treating patients is simply a doctor&#39;s duty-and besides... you&#39;ve already compensated me.&#34; Her tone remained light, but her eyes hinted that they&#39;d covered this topic before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton sat up straighter, his gaze unwavering. &#34;That amount could never repay your kindness of saving my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace arched a brow. &#34;Oh? Then how would you prefer to thank me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton leaned in without warning, his voice dipping into a velvety murmur. &#34;How about I repay you by giving you my heart?&#34; What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace blinked, momentarily at a loss. She took a few steps back, her smile unreadable. &#34;That&#39;s not a very funny joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s expression didn&#39;t shift. &#34;I never joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew taut, a subtle tension humming between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the weight of it, Grace gently cleared her throat. &#34;If you&#39;re truly feeling grateful, why not just treat me to a meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, she was getting a little hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Colton&#39;s lips, a glint of amusement flickering in his eyes. &#34;Of course. What would you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace considered it briefly. &#34;I&#39;ve heard that French restaurant on Maple Street has great reviews.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Colton grabbed his coat. &#34;Let&#39;s go,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, surprised by how quickly he moved,but followed nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the car rolled to a stop in front of the French restaurant she mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place exuded sophistication and exclusivity, its atmosphere rich with quiet elegance. Colton was clearly no stranger here-the manager himself appeared at the entrance, greeting them with respect before leading them to a private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once seated, Grace flipped through the menu, her tone light as she remarked, &#34;Seems like you&#39;re quite the regular here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton replied casually, &#34;Yeah, I drop by from time to time for business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, this particular gem belonged to Ryan, the man behind many of the city&#39;s finest dining establishments.He had a penchant for investing in the culinary world.Most of the top-rated restaurants bore his name behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t hesitate to order several of the house specialties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton watched her, a strange feeling stirring in his chest-one he couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After placing her order, Grace passed the menu to the waiter, then glanced up to meet Colton&#39;s contemplative gaze. She lifted a brow slightly. &#34;Mr.Pearson, are you looking at me because you disapprove of my choices?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton tapped the table lightly with his fingers,his voice low and steady. &#34;I&#39;m wondering-who exactly are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, her identity remained a puzzle. Everything about her defied simple explanation. Strange, almost unbelievable things seemed to follow in her wake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace let out a quiet chuckle. &#34;Just an ordinary woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing worth investigating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? Yet I find myself wanting to know more.&#34;His eyes were dark and searching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a sip of juice, her voice calm, indifferent.&#34;Curiosity killed the cat. You might want to tread carefully.&#34;	1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton opened his mouth to respond, but the door to the private room swung open without warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man in a casual suit stepped inside, wearing a roguish grin. &#34;I saw your car downstairs and wondered who you were meeting. So this is a date?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he finished speaking, his gaze landed on Grace, and his expression shifted. His lips parted in surprise. &#34;Miss Miller! A pleasure to finally meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With effortless charm, Ryan pulled out a chair and sat down,as if he belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A pleasure to meet you, too,&#34; Grace replied politely,her posture composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Miller, feel free to order anything you like.Today,it&#39;s all on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Colton was finally loosening up. Ryan almost felt emotional-like a proud elder brother witnessing personal growth. Colton had always been all work, untouched by romance. But now, he was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>looking at Grace as if she were the only person in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Grace said with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had recognized him immediately-Ryan Clark,the famous restaurateur and Colton&#39;s childhood friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton frowned. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan leaned back with a smile, eyes twinkling as they flicked to Grace. &#34;How could I miss the chance to treat Miss Miller properly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace offered a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryan gave Colton a playful wink and raised his voice a little. &#34;Colton, you&#39;ve been holding out on me! You knew I wanted to meet her, yet you kept her to yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s face darkened. &#34;Ryan, you&#39;re talking too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she observed their exchange, Grace couldn&#39;t help but chuckle quietly. The ambiance in the room was greatly lightened by her laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mind him,&#34; Ryan said, pouring her a cup of coffee with practiced flair. &#34;He&#39;s always been the quiet type. But bringing you here? That says something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton shot him a warning glare. &#34;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be busy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very busy!&#34; Ryan waved dramatically. &#34;But when I heard she was here, I just had to stop by and say hello.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice into a conspiratorial murmur.&#34;You know, Miss Miller, you&#39;re the first woman Colton&#39;s ever brought to this place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace raised an amused brow in Colton&#39;s direction.&#34;Oh? Then I must be truly honored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable.&#34;Ryan,don&#39;t you have work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, I&#39;m going.&#34; Ryan stood, brushing imaginary dust off his jacket. &#34;I&#39;ll tell the kitchen to speed things up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned to leave, he gave Grace one last wink.&#34;Miss Miller, let&#39;s share a meal sometime. Just the two of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton took a slow sip of his coffee. &#34;He&#39;s always been like that. Don&#39;t let it get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the waiters arrived, carrying an array of elegantly plated dishes. The table quickly filled with the restaurant&#39;s finest offerings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace picked up her fork and sampled one of the signature dishes. Her eyes lit up instantly. &#34;The flavor is truly outstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton watched her, the corners of his mouth lifting into a smile before he realized it. &#34;If you like it, help yourself to more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued their meal in comfortable silence,the atmosphere between them warm and unexpectedly peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they were nearing the end of the meal, Grace&#39;s phone began to vibrate on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the screen, her expression tightening as a faint frown appeared. &#34;Excuse me, I need to take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped aside and answered the call. Rodger&#39;s anxious voice rushed through the speaker. &#34;Grace, it&#39;s your aunt Eliana. Her condition just took a sudden turn.Can you get to the hospital right away?&#34;</p>
