                <p>Johnny immediately shook his head and said, &#34;I don&#39;t want Gianna tutoring me.I only want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he and Gianna were related, their relationship had always been shallow, more for appearances than genuine connection. There was hardly any interaction between them outside formal occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny was well aware that Gianna, proud and self-assured, respected his brother solely because of his talent and status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came to him, she barely hid her disdain.Even though they were classmates, he had gotten in through his father&#39;s influence, while Gianna had earned her spot through sheer merit. That fact only deepened her contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, if I have time after school, I&#39;ll tutor you,&#34;Beatrice replied, her warm smile lighting up her face. Lately, she&#39;d had a minor falling-out with her benefactor, which left her with time to spare.Entertaining Johnny was convenient-and it didn&#39;t hurt to keep him dangling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was gentle and reassuring, the kind that soothed Johnny&#39;s restless heart. That was also part of the reason he was so drawn to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the library, Grace had planned to take a taxi home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already let Julia know she&#39;d be staying late to study, so there was no need for her to come pick her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia had responded with a flurry of cheerful emojis,even promising to make Grace a special dinner that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace thought about how Julia always insisted she eat more, which could be a bit much at times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t trying to diet, and her fast metabolism meant she never gained weight easily. Still, her appetite had always been modest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped through the school gate, a sleek,top-of-the-line Lamborghini glided to a stop in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a newly released model, with only three of its kind in the world. Grace, being a motorsport enthusiast, had followed its debut closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But considering her current role as a hardworking student, she&#39;d set aside her dream of owning a car for the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,seeing one up close, it was hard to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What stunned her even more was the person stepping out of the car-it was none other than Colton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a coincidence, we meet again,&#34; he said smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Grace asked, lifting an eyebrow. &#34;The anniversary of my alma mater is coming up,&#34;Colton explained with ease. &#34;The principal called personally and invited me to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace found that odd. Someone like him didn&#39;t need to show up just to accept an invitation. &#34;So why come in person now?&#34; she asked, curious despite herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just finished discussing a few things with the principal,&#34; he replied casually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said, not bothering to ask what they talked about. Business matters never interested her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you heading home? Let me give you a ride,&#34;Colton offered, his tone leaving little room for refusal.&#34;You saved my life once. Offering you a lift is the least | can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had gone out of his way to be considerate, and it would feel rude to turn him down. Besides, it spared her the effort of hailing a taxi-something her naturally lazy side welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,without hesitation, Grace slid into the passenger seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away, Lizzie exclaimed, &#34;Gianna,look. Grace Miller sure moves fast-looks like she&#39;s switched men again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just moments earlier, Lizzie and Gianna had witnessed Grace stepping into a sleek, unfamiliar car with a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t seen his face-he had his back to them -but his towering height, commanding presence,and refined attire spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even from behind, he radiated sophistication. And that car-flashy and impossible to miss-was in a league of its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s always had a flirtatious streak,&#34; Gianna replied, her voice calm, her face emotionless.Yet her words dripped with venom, betraying the irritation bubbling beneath her composed surface. &#34;Given her lowly background, it&#39;s not surprising. Clinging to wealthy men is probably her way of running from the past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a shame! Her cumulative scandals would seriously damage the Holden family&#39;s reputation if they were made public,&#34; Lizzie said, wanting to win Gianna over because she knew she didn&#39;t like Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna said nothing, but the frustration twisting in her chest was difficult to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was the recent exams or Terry&#39;s endorsement, she had lost-to the same person every time. Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Ellie, her teacher, now seemed to harbor quiet regret over the choices she&#39;d made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time after time, Gianna found Grace stood in her way, stealing the spotlight and pushing her further into the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t matter. With the upcoming anniversary celebration on the horizon, a wave of alumni-now influential figures in various fields-would be returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it the head of the Pearson family would be among them. That meant the game wasn&#39;t over yet. She still had a chance. A chance to step on Grace and rise again in a blaze of glory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve made a patch of Rejuvenation PilI. I&#39;ll bring some to you next time,&#34; Grace said suddenly, her voice steady as they drove through the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Colton&#39;s support, Eliana no longer had to wait in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace never liked owing favors. Giving him some pills felt like a fair return-with a little interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she&#39;d earned far more from their last deal than she had ever expected.</p>
