                <p>Grace&#39;s expression turned grave. &#34;I&#39;ll be right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swiftly reached for her coat. &#34;Mr. Pearson, thank you for your hospitality, but something urgent has come up-I need to leave immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Colton rose to his feet.&#34;I&#39;ll take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, thank you!&#34; she replied,quickly following him out. As the car sped off, Grace sat in silence, her gaze fixed on the blur of the retreating scenery.In her mind,calculations turned rapidly-scenarios, symptoms,timelines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had examined Eliana briefly weeks ago. Half a month had passed since then. If her instincts were right, the malignant growth had likely advanced-its spread now a matter of time, not possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton handled the car with controlled urgency, his driving smooth yet swift. Before Grace could fully gather her thoughts, they were already pulling into the hospital entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stole a glance at her. Her mind was clearly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>elsewhere-focused,intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colton, ever the composed gentleman,chose not to pry. &#34;We&#39;re here. Do you want me to come in with you?&#34; His offer, spoken calmly, was rare and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, thank you.&#34; Grace gave a polite nod before stepping out and hurrying toward the hospital doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton watched her disappear into the building,his gaze lingering. Just then,his phone buzzed sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen. His eyes narrowed, the coldness in them returning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Grace arrived to find the emergency room entrance in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was crowded with members of the Holden family-relatives of Eliana.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace,thank God you&#39;re here.&#34; Julia spotted her and rushed over, grasping her hand tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana collapsed earlier today. They rushed her here,and now she&#39;s in the ER. The doctors say the tumor&#39;s grown too large and is beginning to spread.Surgery is urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They said it&#39;s risky. Her survival depends on what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>happens next.&#34; Before Rodger could finish,Grace had already deduced the rest-her clinical mind filling in the missing pieces with chilling clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger silently nodded, realizing once again that bringing Grace had been the right call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, Eliana&#39;s still inside. The doctors haven&#39;t said anything yet. Isn&#39;t it a bit much to make such assumptions now?&#34; Gianna spoke up, her voice gentle on the surface, but her eyes sparkled with veiled malice. She clearly wanted others to believe Grace was bringing bad luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough, after hearing these words, Claire,who had been grieving, leaped to her feet and yelled,&#34;Grace! How could you? My mom&#39;s fighting for her life,and you&#39;re already declaring doom! Are you even human?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t a curse,&#34; Julia countered sharply, shielding her daughter. &#34;Grace is simply telling the truth so everyone can be mentally prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough. This isn&#39;t the place for drama.&#34; Rodger stepped in, trying to keep things calm. &#34;We should wait for the doctors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, who&#39;s performing Aunt Eliana&#39;s surgery?&#34; Grace cut in, her tone firm. &#34;If you trust me, I can do it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the air tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t waste time with pleasantries. A case this severe needed precision and expertise beyond what most doctors could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In most hospitals, the odds of surviving such surgery were under ten percent. But with Grace in charge, the success rate would rise to over ninety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; Claire blinked, then barked out a laugh. &#34;Did I hear that right? You think you can perform surgery?Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, this isn&#39;t a joke,&#34; Gianna added with a sneer,looking at her with blatant contempt. &#34;You&#39;re not a doctor. Playing with someone&#39;s life isn&#39;t something you do just because you feel confident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Grace really think anyone could just become a doctor and start performing surgeries? Even if she&#39;d studied medicine, picking up a scalpel wasn&#39;t something that could be done casually or without rigorous training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! And Uncle Carl already invited the Master Healer,Kevin Chadwick, to handle the surgery. With him operating on my mother, there&#39;s nothing to worry about!&#34; Clair declared smugly, her voice brimming with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had never met Carl before. He had only just returned from abroad after learning about Eliana&#39;s critical condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Claire, Carl was a man of action-someone who got results, unlike the people standing around wasting breath on empty words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe Grace is joking, nor would she ever treat something so serious lightly.&#34; Julia&#39;s voice rang out, calm yet firm. &#34;She made a suggestion,that&#39;s all.Whether you accept it or not is your choice-but questioning her ability is stepping out of line. That judgment isn&#39;t yours to make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia made a strong statement. She believed in her daughter without reservation. She&#39;d known Grace for a short time, but she knew enough about her to know her in general.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the pills Grace had given her had been a huge success. She was feeling much better, both physically and emotionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the family&#39;s arguments, Rodger maintained his composure. Hurried footsteps echoed as he considered how to manage the situation objectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all turned to see a man in a suit with rimless glasses and a man in a white coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This doctor was Kevin, the Master Healer, if they were not mistaken.</p>
