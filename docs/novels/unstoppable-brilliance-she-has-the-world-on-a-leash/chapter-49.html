                <p>Grace returned home, thinking Colton should&#39;ve paid the bill today. That thought made her feel a bit indebted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she was visiting him for a follow-up the next day,she felt it would be the right time to thank him in person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton had been under treatment for a while now, and the results were impressive. He could stand and walk with ease. At this rate, he&#39;d be fully recovered soon-all thanks to Grace&#39;s efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, she arrived at Colton&#39;s residence on schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler welcomed her at the door with a polite smile. &#34;Miss Miller, Mr. Pearson is waiting in his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace gave a small nod and walked straight there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she pushed the door open, she saw Colton standing by the large window. Sunlight streamed in, casting a glow around his tall figure. He looked calm and elegant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her enter, he turned with a soft smile.&#34;Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Morning. You&#39;re recovering well. You can stand for quite a while now,&#34; Grace said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton let out a light chuckle. &#34;All thanks to your healing hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her kit down and motioned for him to sit then began her routine check-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She examined him carefully, eyes focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she looked up. &#34;Everything looks great. Keep this up for another two weeks, and you&#39;ll be completely healed.&#34; She spoke calmly, as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of amusement crossed Colton&#39;s eyes. The news was music to his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he said sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome. And by the way, thank you for yesterday.I assume you paid for the meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nothing. Compared to what you&#39;ve done for me,a meal doesn&#39;t count,&#34; he replied. He hadn&#39;t expected her to catch on so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace packed her kit. &#34;I was only doing my job.Besides, you&#39;ve already paid the consultation fee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her watch. &#34;I&#39;ve got other things to attend to, so I&#39;ll be going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have the driver take you home,&#34; Colton offered.He still needed to soak in a medicinal bath and couldn&#39;t see her off personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need. I have another stop,&#34; Grace declined She was going to meet Patrick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton didn&#39;t insist. There would be plenty of chances in the future. He watched her leave, his gaze gentle and thoughtful. He lightly touched the spot where she had brushed against him. The warmth still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, Grace took a taxi to the city center. She had arranged to meet Patrick there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped out of the car, her eyes caught sight of a couple not far away, acting very close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman wore a white skirt and a light blue off-shoulder top. She giggled sweetly, nestled in the arms of a suited middle-aged man. She leaned into him, fingers lazily tracing circles on his chest. Her high heels clicked lightly on the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace narrowed her eyes. The silhouette looked familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman turned slightly, and Grace&#39;s eyes widened -it was Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, no doubt about it. Johnny&#39;s crush, Beatrice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had saved her before, so her face was Beatrice whispered something to the man, making him laugh out loud. His pudgy hand slid along her waist, his smile a little too eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked to be in his forties. His suit strained over his large belly, his grin downright lecherous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace couldn&#39;t believe it. Beatrice had always seemed so sweet and innocent. Did Johnny even know who she really was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Grace looked again, the two were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; A familiar voice pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to see Patrick. &#34;Finally. You&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for the delay. What were you staring at just now?&#34; he asked, noticing her distracted look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing important. Oh, here-the pills for this month,&#34;she said, handing him a small bottle. She had been making extra lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patrick smiled as he took it. &#34;You&#39;ve been on fire lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When am I not?&#34; Grace raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;Right, right, you&#39;re amazing every day.Oh, there&#39;s a Aurora Gem Fair this weekend. Tons of raw stones.Interested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She passed him the bottle, sunlight brushing against her fingers. &#34;Aurora Gem Fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. They&#39;ll even have many raw stones from abroad.Might be something special there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace was intrigued. She had a knack for finding hidden treasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds good. Just send me the invite when you get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also remembered Julia liked jade. Maybe she&#39;d find something special for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they parted ways, Grace returned home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia wasn&#39;t back yet. Johnny was in the living room,talking on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beatrice, not free again?&#34; he asked, sounding a little let down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace couldn&#39;t hear the reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny continued, &#34;Working? Don&#39;t overdo it,okay?|can come to you instead. Alright then. I got you a gift.I&#39;ll keep saving for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, he ended the call with a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, he saw Grace standing nearby. She must have heard everything. Embarrassed, he snapped,&#34;What are you staring at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace answered calmly, &#34;A man made a fool of himself.&#34;</p>
