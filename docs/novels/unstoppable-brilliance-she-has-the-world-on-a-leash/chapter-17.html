                <p>Grace&#39;s eyes narrowed in thought. Prof. WVarren from Summit University? Did Gianna mean Terry Warren?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips twitching into a faint,knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been about a year since Grace last saw him and she never figured he&#39;d show up at Briskvale High.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few steps away, Gianna stood stiffly, digging her nails into her palms. She stared at Grace with eyes full of envy and quiet fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d make sure Grace was out of the Holden family soon. Then she would be the only pampered girl in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia,picking up on the tension, gently reached for Grace&#39;s hand. Her voice was soft. &#34;Grace has been working really hard. I know she&#39;ll get into a good university.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia always backed Grace-never doubting her, no matter what others said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel rolled her eyes, her voice sharp and bitter.&#34;Working hard? Please. She spends all her time with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>those sketchy men. Tell me, what kind of future does that lead to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t let it rattle her. She met Ethel&#39;s stare with a calm, even tone. &#34;My friends are good people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, then added with a flicker of confidence in her eyes, &#34;And college? That won&#39;t be a problem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel scowled, irritated by Grace&#39;s self-assuredness.&#34;You should learn to stay in your lane.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t bother arguing. She just smiled, polite and cool. Just wait and see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, whispers followed Grace as soon as she stepped onto the school grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Grace Miller? Her life&#39;s a wreck, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s pretty, but so what? I heard she only got in because of her connections.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Word is her grades suck, and the Holden family&#39;s just paying to keep her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip clung to her like dust, but Grace didn&#39;t blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d heard worse before. She knew who she was,and she wasn&#39;t about to start explaining herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could&#39;ve silenced them right there if she wanted,but she didn&#39;t. Let themtalk. Let them guess. She had her own way of proving things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At lunch, Adrianna came over, gently placing a hot chocolate in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got this for you,&#34; she said, eyes hopeful. &#34;We all like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace didn&#39;t usually drink hot chocolate, but Adrianna looked so excited she couldn&#39;t say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tasted it and it was indeed great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, genuine smile slipped out. &#34;It&#39;s pretty good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna beamed, but then her voice dropped, quiet and unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for being nice to me. You&#39;re the only one who doesn&#39;t treat me weird... because of the dark mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace looked at her, eyes briefly glancing over the mark on Adrianna&#39;s cheek. Without missing a beat,she said, &#34;That&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ll make a cream for you at home. Use it every day and it&#39;ll fade in a month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna&#39;s head snapped up, eyes wide and glassy.&#34;Are you serious? I&#39;ve tried everything. The doctors all</p>
                
                
                
                <p>say there&#39;s no fix... even laser didn&#39;t work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace chuckled under her breath. &#34;That&#39;s because they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Adrianna&#39;s shoulder a light pat. &#34;Don&#39;t worry I got you. You&#39;ll look amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrianna&#39;s throat tightened, but she nodded, tears threatening to spill. &#34;I believe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Grace didn&#39;t waste time. She pulled out her supplies and got to work on the cream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would take a bit of time to, get it just right,but she had all the ingredients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the weekend rolled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace remembered Adrianna&#39;s invite to go shopping.A first for her, really.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They agreed to meet at the mall in the heart of the city on Saturday. The mall was packed with shops of every kind-from designer labels to tiny stores that sold the weirdest little trinkets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace arrived early and wandered around a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building buzzed with energy. Grace leaned</p>
                
                
                
                <p>casually by the fifth-floor railing, scrolling on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her outfit simple-black high-waisted jeans,a light T-shirt tucked in, and an oversized white trench coat. Nothing flashy, but she pulled it off effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far off, Demi stood twirling in front of a mirror.She wore a floral designer dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,does this one look good?&#34; Demi asked, turning slightly,watching her reflection with careful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lvy nodded, all smiles. &#34;Of course, sweetheart.You look perfect in everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi was soaking up the praise when her eyes drifted outside the store-and landed on Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile dropped. &#34;Mom,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi said with a frown, &#34;isn&#39;t that Grace over there?What&#39;s she even doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivy looked over, her face turning sour the moment she spotted Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t the kind of place she belongs,&#34; lvy said under her breath, full of scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She sure doesn&#39;t dress like she belongs,&#34; Demi mocked,looking at Grace&#39;s ordinary clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guess she&#39;s finally hit rock bottom. That&#39;s what she gets for shoving you in that pool,&#34;Ivy sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She just couldn&#39;t stand that I was back and lost her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget about Grace. We&#39;ve dealt with that already.Today&#39;s for us-to find some new outfits. Don&#39;t let her spoil it,&#34; Ivy added, spotting a dress she liked and disappearing into a fitting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Demi wasn&#39;t done. She flung the dress she&#39;d been trying on toward a sales clerk, adjusted her collar, and made her way toward Grace with an extra swing in her step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace, what a surprise.&#34; Demi cooed, her voice overly sweet. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect to see you here. Shopping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never missed an opportunity to throw shade at Grace.</p>
