                <p>After finishing her breakfast, Grace began preparing for the day ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had an appointment lined up-a medical consultation for someone in the Pearson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relying on no one but herself, she hailed a cab for the journey rather than accept any offer from the Pearsons for a driver. The last thing she ever wanted was a fuss or a dramatic arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors swirled that today&#39;s patient was someone of considerable importance, which explained all the secrecy surrounding the visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the Pearsons had set aside an entire medical wing for the occasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton had insisted that no one find out about Dr. private visit. If his uncle discovered the arrangement,complications would surely follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relying on the address Patrick had texted her, Grace rode straight to the estate, avoiding all fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cap shadowed her eyes as she strode toward the main gates, every step light and unhurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside, Dominick lingered, fidgeting as he kept watch for a mysterious arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, a young woman in a crisp white T-shirt and simple jeans crossed his line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long, slender legs carried her with a quiet confidence,her movements graceful yet nearly silent on the pavement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Miller?&#34; Dominick called out, momentarily caught off guard by her presence. Today, of all days, wasn&#39;t ideal for random visitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go inside,&#34; Grace replied, her tone cool and businesslike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick hesitated, uncertainty creeping into his voice. &#34;I apologize, but I&#39;m actually expecting someone else. You&#39;re here for Mr. Pearson, right? He may not be available this morning...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s gaze kept darting down the driveway, still searching for the legendary doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration threatened as he recalled insisting on personally escorting the enigmatic doctor, only to be politely turned down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Double-checking her phone, Grace frowned, glancing at the estate behind him. &#34;This is the Pearsons&#39; estate,isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Patrick send her the wrong address?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right,&#34; Dominick answered, a bit more formal now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here for Mr. Pearson&#39;s treatment. Please, show me the way,&#34; she said without a hint of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait! You-you&#39;re Dr. Q?&#34; Dominick stammered, shock flickering across his face. In a scramble, he nearly lost his glasses, fumbling to steady them, his nerves completely unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything he&#39;d pictured about Dr. Q-someone older,perhaps with a commanding presence-seemed utterly wrong now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No part of him wanted to believe that this unassuming young woman could be the famed healer he&#39;d heard so much about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite witnessing Grace work her magic before, he still found it hard to equate her with the famed Dr. Q.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions hung on his tongue, but Grace had no patience for explanations. Instead, a small nod was all she gave as she reached into her canvas bag and produced a wooden token.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elegant carvings covered the surface, and a boldcaught the light in the center, unmistakable and proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s breath hitched. There was no mistaking it-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the token was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please forgive me! I truly did not mean it!&#34; Dominick bent low at the waist, cheeks flushed as a nervous sweat began trickling from his hairline. &#34;Dr. Q, right this way. Mr.Pearson has been waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked together down the corridor, their footsteps echoing until they reached a small,separate building on the western edge of the grounds. This was the private medical facility reserved for Colton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick had only just lifted his hand to knock when the door swung open from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the room, several figures waited-the leading specialists from the top hospitals-engaged in a serious debate, every face shadowed by worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With Mr. Pearson&#39;s state, I believe we should avoid risky procedures and proceed with caution,&#34; said one of the doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is not enough. Surgery gives him his only real hope. The toxins are aIready moving through his body,&#34;another doctor insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm and unmistakable voice rang out from the entrance. &#34;Seems like every one of you is ready to write him off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned at once, startled by the interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick was no longer alone. A young woman stood at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All around, doctors furrowed their brows in confusion.Who was she, and what was she doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodney Powell, one of the more senior doctors, glared in disapproval. &#34;Who let her in? This is no place for childish nonsense. Get her out of here-immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration echoed through the group as the other doctors voiced their complaints. The mounting tension in the room made it clear that they had little patience left for unexpected guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Byrd, escort her out. We&#39;re discussing a matter of life and death here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a careful step forward, Dominick&#39;s voice carried both caution and resolve. &#34;Doctors, please. This is Dr.Q, the very specialist Mr. Pearson asked to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An immediate hush fell over everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Q? This young woman? Surely, someone must be playing a trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodney&#39;s face tightened with open disbelief, his annoyance growing. &#34;You can&#39;t expect us to take this seriously. Does she even have a license? We&#39;re surrounded by enough imposters already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. You have got to be joking. People these days will try anything for money-even trying to con Mr.Pearson? She must be out of her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Years of training make a real doctor. What could she possibly know at her age?&#34; another physician scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of mocking laughter and pointed glances spread through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s lips twitched with a sly confidence. &#34;Suppose I manage to pull him through-what will you say then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor let out a harsh laugh. &#34;You? Heal Mr.Pearson?Don&#39;t make us laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you pull that off, I&#39;ll believe in miracles-or that pigs might fly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cool nod, Grace replied, &#34;Then we&#39;re in for an extraordinary spectacle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very moment, a familiar face appeared at the door. It was Colton in his usual relaxed clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze turned cold the second he spotted Grace in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had wondered if it might be her, but coming face-to-face with Grace left him shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was true-Dr. Q was Grace Miller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They locked eyes-hers calm and full of resolve, his unreadable and intense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his features looked tired, the powerful aura he carried had not faded in the least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned out he was her patient.</p>
