                <p>Eliana hurried to smooth things over. &#34;Julia, please don&#39;t be upset. Claire spoke impulsively because she&#39;s worried about me. She meant no harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secretly, though, she wvished Claire wouldn&#39;t always blurt out exactly what was on her mind without considering the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With lips pressed tightly, Grace studied Eliana before saying, &#34;Dr. Morrison might not have answers for your illness, but don&#39;t lose hope. Someone else can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Grace&#39;s words, Eliana&#39;s face shifted. &#34;Who could it possibly be?&#34; The question escaped before she could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she being naive again? Why was she grasping at thin air? In her view, Grace had never shown herself to be reliable-what miracle solution could she possibly offer? Certainly, Grace had no connections to anyone capable or famous. Maybe the sickness was getting to her own head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, Gianna&#39;s irritation bubbled over. &#34;Grace,you aren&#39;t implying you&#39;re the miracle healer, are you? You genuinely believe you can cure Aunt Eliana&#39;s stomach cancer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I am,&#34; Grace replied with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent, as though caught in a cold grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana felt the fragile spark of hope wvithin her flicker and vanish into a familiar ache of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced herself into a bitter, weary smile. &#34;Grace,please stop this nonsense...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire,unable to contain herself any longer, sharply interjected, &#34;Do you realize the kind of trouble your bragging could cause? Aren&#39;t you afraid of being caught in your own lies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s mouth twisted scornfully. To her, Grace had clearly lost her sense of reality, thinking she was superior to world-renowned experts. She had rarely seen anyone with such nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel&#39;s face was equally tense, disbelief etched deeply as Grace&#39;s claims grew more absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace merely offered a small, calm smile. &#34;It&#39;s your choice to believe or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Julia hurried after her, offering comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While doubt filled the room, Julia remained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unwavering. After all, she&#39;d personally experienced the extraordinary effects of the medicine Grace developed. She trusted implicitly in her daughter&#39;s honesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion rippled among those left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger&#39;s brow creased slightly. He couldn&#39;t imagine Grace speaking without reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eliana, don&#39;t lose hope. I&#39;ll do everything I can to find someone who can truly help,&#34; he said gently, noticing the shadow on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled whispers about a mysterious healer named Dr. Q, reputed to defy death itself and conquer diseases thought unbeatable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding Dr. Q was nearly impossible; the mysterious doctor never made any public appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, disbelieving laugh slipped from Eliana.&#34;Dr.Q?&#34; she said. &#34;Rodger, that&#39;s just a story people like to whisper about...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wavering, Rodger met her doubts with certainty. &#34;I&#39;ve already sent out investigators.Any clue at all, and we&#39;ll do whatever it takes to bring this doctor here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Eliana nodded, a smile flickering across her face though it didn&#39;t reach her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly,Gianna broke the quiet with a new idea.&#34;I came across something interesting-there&#39;s an auction this weekend. Supposedly, a miracle cure will be up for bid, claimed to heal any sickness and restore youth. An enigmatic healer created it, and the city&#39;s wealthy all line up for a chance at it. Maybe it&#39;s worth a look for Aunt Eliana?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ethel couldn&#39;t hide her excitement. &#34;Seriously? We have to check it out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence followed as Rodger weighed the option.&#34;I&#39;ll assign someone to investigate the medicine. If it truly works, we&#39;ll secure it, whatever the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire&#39;s face lit up, her joy unmistakable. &#34;You mean it?That&#39;s amazing. We really have totry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every possible option needed exploring if there was any hope of easing her mother&#39;s illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That approach certainly sounded more promising than paying attention to Grace&#39;s bragging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Grace picked up her phone to find Patrick on the line. &#34;Hi, I&#39;ve got some exciting news. There&#39;s an auction coming up this weekend-rare medicinal treasures will be up for grabs, but the real star is our &#39;Rejuvenation Pill&#39;. I&#39;ve set aside two just for the auction. Interested? I managed to snag an invitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gaining entry to events like this wasn&#39;t easy; only the select few with exclusive invites could hope to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sounds good, I&#39;ll go have a look,&#34; she replied, not having any pressing plans for the weekend anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, Eliana relied on prescribed medications while Rodger&#39;s efforts remained focused on the elusive Dr. Q.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her part, Grace stepped aside, letting them follow their own path. If her advice went unheeded, she saw no point in pressing further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different day found Grace scheduled for a house call to Colton&#39;s-her last check-up for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Progress from her earlier treatments had left Colton on the verge of full health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival, the butler received her with a deep bow.&#34;Miss Miller, Mr. Pearson is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She acknowledged him with a nod and made her way directly to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Colton stood quietly at a window, posture commanding and gaze unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned as soon as he heard her approach, his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attention sharpening. &#34;You&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace returned the look, her answer measured,replying, &#34;Go ahead and lie down. This is your final follow-up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtle smile, Colton&#39;s tone dropped to a murmur.&#34;Are you really convincedI&#39;m back to normal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One eyebrow arched, Grace shot him a teasing look.&#34;So,have you lost faith in my abilities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s laughter was quiet, almost warm, as he settled back and let her begin her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady hands, she pressed her fingertips to his wrist, feeling for a steady rhythm. After a few thoughtful seconds, a smile played at her lips. &#34;Your recovery is complete. Every trace of the toxin is gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of mischief danced in Colton&#39;s eyes. Out of nowhere,he caught her wrist and grinned. &#34;Grace,you&#39;ve pulled me back from the edge. Any ideas on how I might repay you?&#34;</p>
