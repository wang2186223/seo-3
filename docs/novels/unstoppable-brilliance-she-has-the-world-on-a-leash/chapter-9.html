                <p>Beneath the city, the underground market sprawled like a tangled ant colony, every tunnel thick with the scent of damp stone, rusted metal, bitter herbs, and the faintest trace of something metallic and bloody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down here, the boundaries of legality blurred-contraband herbs exchanged hands, ancient manuscripts changed owners, and shadowy services operated just out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever had vanished from the surface world could still be found below, provided one&#39;s wallet was heavy enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the threshold, Grace pulled a black baseball cap from her bag, tucking her hair beneath it and lowering the brim until herfeatures all but disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hands into her pockets and ambled forward, blending into the crowd with the casual air of someone out for a weekend stroll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than a few curious eyes followed her-lone young women rarely wandered into these depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a group of rough-looking men broke off their</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bargaining to ogle her, surprise flickering in their expressions before one offered a slow, predatory grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you take a wrong turn, young lady?&#34; asked the biggest of them, stepping into her path, menace in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even pausing,Grace lifted her chin just enough for her icy stare to flash from beneath the brim,and the brute stumbled back, unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning away from their gawking, Grace slipped through the warren of alleys with practiced confidence, soon arriving at a stall marked by a tarnished bronze plaque bearing the number 17.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of a standard door, an animal hide hung in the entry, etched with cryptic runes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace brushed the hide aside and stepped into the fragrant interior, the air inside thick with herbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were cool and direct as she addressed the shopkeeper, saying, &#34;I&#39;m here for the real thing-the best you&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody in the underground market cared about the story behind the merchandise or haggled over price;only one thing mattered-getting their hands on the finest available.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rough chuckle echoed from the shadows behind the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>counter.&#34;And who might you be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward, a burly middle-aged man with hard features revealed himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He peered at the figure before him, his scowl deepening when he realized it was just a girl in a baseball cap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s attempt to hide her identity wasn&#39;t fooling anyone; her slim frame and smooth, youthful jaw gave her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took in her plain white T-shirt, faded jeans, and the absence of anything resembling a designer bag. The verdict was immediate-a broke student.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive wave, he tried to usher her out. &#34;Go on, run along! This isn&#39;t a playground for kids.Everything here costs millions. You probably don&#39;t even have lunch money, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t fathom where she found the nerve to even walk in. Intent on ignoring her, he turned toward the storeroom, but a gentle laugh froze him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace stood calmly, producing a sleek black card from her pocket and letting it rest, almost carelessly, on the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have money on this card?&#34; Skepticism clouded the shopkeeper&#39;s face as he picked up the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>card, swiping it through the reader-only to have his eyes widen at the staggering balance staring back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, his attitude flipped. With a greedy smile and hurried,deferential gestures, he replied, &#34;Miss, please forgive my rudeness! Five million for the foxglove. I&#39;ll have it for you right away-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, chaos erupted near the entrance,interrupting the negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shopkeeper&#39;s head jerked up, and his expression shifted instantly as he rushed to the door,bowing low.&#34;Mr.Byrd! What an honor to have you stop by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick Byrd strode in, his tailored suit and commanding presence leaving no doubt about his status. &#34;I heard you&#39;re holding a rare foxglove. Mr.Pearson wants it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervousness prickled at the shopkeeper&#39;s skin, sweat glistening as he forced a smile. &#34;You&#39;re always up to date! I do have the item, but the price is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick cut him off with a cold sneer, tossing a check across the counter. &#34;Eight million. Wrap it up.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shopkeeper&#39;s head nodded eagerly. &#34;Of course,sir! Right away-&#34; But before he could move, fingers clamped around his wrist with surprising strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around, only to meet the cold fire in Grace&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was here first.&#34; The words weren&#39;t shouted, but the edge in her voice made them cut deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint line appeared between her brows, and the air grew noticeably colder, tension rippling out from where she stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have one rule here-highest offer gets the goods,&#34;the shopkeeper snapped, his voice dripping with contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he saw was a reckless young woman, no match for real power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Certainly, he would say no to eight million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Grace&#39;s voice rang out, calm and unyielding.&#34;Ten million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s voice was firm and unyielding. &#34;Fifteen million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s eyes flashed with cold resolve. &#34;Twenty million,&#34; she answered, not missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stunned silence fell over the shopkeeper as his jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the top floor, the scene in the exclusive VIP suite</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was entirely different. Colton reclined on a sleek leather sofa, fingers drumming idly on the armrest,his every gesture dripping with unspoken authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominick&#39;s update was brisk. &#34;Sir, she&#39;s just offered twenty million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colton&#39;s lips curled slightly, his reply low and commanding, saying, &#34;Raise it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the shopkeeper leaned in and whispered urgently, &#34;Young lady, you&#39;re treading on dangerous ground.The man backing him isn&#39;t someone ordinary people can afford to cross.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just the thought of the Pearson family&#39;s shadow looming over the city made the shopkeeper shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, mocking grin spread across Grace&#39;s lips,her eyes glittering with defiance. &#34;Do I look like someone easily intimidated?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ferocity radiating from her sent the shopkeeper stumbling backward, fear quickening his pulse. Who was this girl, really? This could only end badly. The realization struck him with a jolt-he was caught between two powers he couldn&#39;t afford to anger.</p>
