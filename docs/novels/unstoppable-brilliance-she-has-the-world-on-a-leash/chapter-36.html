                <p>The sound of the bell filled the halls, marking the beginning of a test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Students darted to their desks, eager to settle before the proctor arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace found herself seated at the very front, directly beneath the sharp gaze of the proctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could say for certain if this arrangement was deliberate or just a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Ellie swept into the classroom, a stack of test papers pressed against her chest. Her eyes landed on Grace with a fleeting spark of contempt. She silently vowed to monitor Grace closely today,convinced she would catch her at something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The math exam came first. As soon as the proctors handed out the tests, a chorus of shocked whispers rippled through the students.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The questions proved far more daunting than anyone had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just scraping a passing score would feel like finding aThe List treasure chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic turned to resolve as pens hit the paper, every student racing against the clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that same room, Gianna kept an eye on Grace, who sat a few seats away, perfectly in her line of sight.What struck Gianna was that Grace hadn&#39;t even picked up her pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin crept across Gianna&#39;s face. Just as she suspected, Grace had no clue how to begin, not even bothering to fake confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie and another proctor stood watch, but Ellie&#39;s focus rarely drifted from Grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fully expected to catch Grace trying to pull off another unbelievable result.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, not even half an hour had passed before Grace surprised everyone by setting down her pen and lifting her hand, signaling she was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? You realize it&#39;s far too early to turn in your test,&#34; the proctor said, disapproving. Poor marks were one thing, but such a lackadaisical attitude was something else entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace looked up with wide, innocent eyes. &#34;I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take another look at your answers,&#34;the proctor advised, still frowning. The room erupted with barely stifled laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her desk, Gianna almost let out a dramatic sigh.Who did Grace think she was fooling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for that,&#34; said Grace, swinging her backpack onto her shoulder and walking out without a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the other students, she seemed like a lost cause.Watching her hand in her paper so early brought everyone a strange sense of comfort; surely she&#39;d rank lowest in the class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie retrieved Grace&#39;s exam, scanning the pages in disbelief. Every answer box had something filled in, but she doubted any were right. Clearly, this was nothing more than an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the following two days, Grace was always the first to turn in her exams, never once hesitating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the last test ended, students let out a collective breath, though a current of anxiety lingered about the results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep things above board, teachers gathered to grade the tests together, shuffing the papers so names remained hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sipping from her cup, Ellie tried to sound humble. &#34;I&#39;m curious how our students did this time. I&#39;ve heard some weren&#39;t too sure about their performance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A teacher from Class B chimed in, &#34;Ellie, let&#39;s be honest, your students always come out on top. I&#39;m willing to bet the highest score this round is from your class again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a practiced modesty, Ellie replied, &#34;You&#39;re too kind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another teacher joined in, teasing, &#34;The rest of us can only watch as you collect another bonus,Ellie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred, seated nearby, received a consoling pat on the back from the neighboring teacher. &#34;Don&#39;t feel too down, Fred. People understand your class has its challenges. It can&#39;t turn out too badly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing his glasses higher, Fred replied, &#34;Thanks,but trust my students will surprise us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent scoff rose in Ellie&#39;s thoughts. Soon enough,she believed, Fred&#39;s faith would be dashed. With Grace pulling the scores down, she expected her own class to widen the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the teachers finished grading and gathered in the office for a bit of banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe what I found-a paper with every answer correct, even the open-ended ones matched perfectly. It honestly gave me chills!&#34; one teacher exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;I saw an essay so good I had to give full marks. That&#39;s a first for me. There was nothing I could deduct-just flawless writing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I graded a math exam with a perfect score.Considering how tough those questions were, it felt unreal-whoever did that is a genius!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another teacher spoke up next. &#34;Same story here-a perfect score across the board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you guys serious?&#34; Ellie&#39;s curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, Ellie. It must be Gianna White in your class,right? She&#39;s gifted in every subject, especially when it comes to essays. No one else could pull this off,&#34;suggested a teacher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie tried to keep her expectations in check. &#34;Who knows? Maybe there&#39;s a dark horse,&#34; she said, not realizing her words would soon ring true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, secret smile flickered on her lips. Deep down,she felt certain Gianna had done it again, though she tried not to gloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the dean strode in, clapping for attention. everyone here? Good! The exam results are ready. You can check your class&#39;s scores now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Optimism shone in the dean&#39;s smile, hinting at strong List results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One more thing. Prof. Terry Warren from Summit University will be coming to teach a special course.The student who impresses the most will get a shot at the coveted recommendation,&#34; the dean announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A confident smile spread across Ellie&#39;s face the moment she heard the news. In her mind, Gianna had all but claimed the top honors already. Gianna&#39;s track record spoke for itself-her foundation was rock-solid,and it seemed impossible for anyone to outperform her. Meanwhile, Grace was another story. If she landed at the bottom, Ellie doubted she would have the nerve to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the dean exited, teachers hurried to their computers, nerves buzzing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With hearts racing, everyone dove into the results,eager to discover how their students had performed,and most of all, which name would top the list.</p>
