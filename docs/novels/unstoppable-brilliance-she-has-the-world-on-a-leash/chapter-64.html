                <p>After the gruelling hours in the operating room, Grace couldn&#39;t hide the tiredness in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire, Carl, and the others followed closely as the nurses wheeled Eliana back to her hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Julia and Rodger stayed behind, their eyes clouded with worry as they watched over their daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be worn out,sweetheart,&#34; Julia said softly,steering Grace toward a small break room down the corridor.&#34;You were on your feet for hours... I brought some soup and pastries. Come sit. You need to eat something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The break room was still and quiet-one of those rare moments where time slowed down just enough to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mom,&#34; Grace murmured, her eyes landing on the food with a flicker of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d performed countless surgeries before-some that stretched nearly two full days. She&#39;d long grown used to powering through hunger, aches, and the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sharp sting of exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, she had family surrounding her with care and warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a spoonful of soup. It didn&#39;t have the finesse of a five-star kitchen, but it tasted like home-and that meant more than perfection ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Silly girl, no need to thank me,&#34; Julia smiled,her voice brimming with affection. &#34;You&#39;re my greatest joy. But even so... I don&#39;t want you to stay in this field.It&#39;s too draining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no suspicion in her tone-no question about how a girl who&#39;d grown up in an orphanage could master such complex surgical skill. She cared only about one thing: whether her was pushing herself too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Grace was just her beloved daughter-someone to be cherished, looked after, and spoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger agreed with a soft nod. &#34;Your mom&#39;s right-you&#39;re our pride. But medicine takes a toll. If you ever get tired of this life, you don&#39;t have to keep going.I&#39;ll take care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rodger wasn&#39;t blind. Deep down, he knew Grace wasn&#39;t just an ordinary girl. Her abilities, her insight-there wvas far more to her than she let on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, with each day spent in her company, his unease faded. She&#39;d never once let them down-never given him a reason to doubt her intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially now, with Julia recovering steadily and even his own health finding a strange sense of balance again-he couldn&#39;t deny that Grace had something to do with it. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead of suspicion, he gave her the one thing she&#39;d rarely known: complete, unwavering trust.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Grace said,a real smile lifting her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After eating a little, she accompanied them back to Eliana&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eliana was awake now, but barely. The surgery had drained her body, and she lay quietly, her eyelids fluttering and lips barely able to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claire,usually sharp-tongued and self-absorbed,now handled her mother with surprising tenderness. She dabbed Eliana&#39;s forehead with a damp cloth and tucked the blanket around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The surgery went well,&#34; Kevin explained, standing just behind Grace. His posture was humble, like someone reporting to a senior rather than an equal.&#34;There were signs that the cancer had started to spread.The next stage-treatment and recovery-will</p>
                
                
                
                <p>be just as important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thankfully, Aunt Eliana had the best of care today,&#34;Gianna added quickly, eager to pull attention away from Grace. &#34;It&#39;s all thanks to Master Healer&#39;s hands-on effort. No wonder the surgery succeeded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to steer the spotlight elsewhere-to shift the story,bend the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kevin didn&#39;t play along. His professional tone didn&#39;t waver. &#34;No. I only assisted. Today&#39;s success was all due to my mentor. Without her leading,things might have gone differently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t exaggerating. Even now, he couldn&#39;t stop replaying Grace&#39;s precise moves in the operating room.Her skill didn&#39;t come from money, fame,or lineage.It came from relentless practice and something harder to define-instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell quiet. Gianna, caught off guard, froze mid-thought. What was wrong with this man? She had handed him the credit-why wouldn&#39;t he just take it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grace is amazing. I always knew she was special,&#34;Julia said,glowing with motherly pride as she reached over to squeeze Grace&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna forced a smile. &#34;Dr. Chadwick, you&#39;re being too modest.&#34; Then, pivoting with fake warmth, she added,&#34;For the follow-up treatments, we&#39;ll still need your</p>
                
                
                
                <p>expertise,of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kevin remained clear and blunt. &#34;There&#39;s really no need. I didn&#39;t do much. I won&#39;t be handling her recovery either. She&#39;s in the best hands already. My mentor can take care of everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna could barely keep her expression in check. Her polite mask threatened to crack. What was going on?Had he lost his mind? Was this Grace&#39;s doing? Some kind of manipulation? How could he speak like this-so confidently, so willingly stepping aside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eliana,though pale and visibly worn down,was fully conscious-and her eyes settled on Grace,steady and unreadable, carrying a weight that was hard to name.</p>
