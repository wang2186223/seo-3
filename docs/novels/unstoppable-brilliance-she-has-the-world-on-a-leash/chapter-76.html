                <p>&#34;Are you talking about Grace Miller?!&#34; Gianna stood up, unable to contain her disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold wave of shock rolled through her. The very idea seemed absurd, like someone had decided to play a cruel joke. Grace, of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s loud reaction caught Terry&#39;s attention. He glanced her way, only to realize Grace was seated quietly beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed and composed, Grace sat with the same serene confidence she always carried. Despite his age, Terry found himself admiring her poise and self-assurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s right-Grace Miller,&#34; Terry assured, his tone unwavering. &#34;If anyone&#39;s uncertain, my assistant will upload her published article to your school&#39;s forum.Feel free to check for yourself.&#34; The certainty in his words suggested he had no doubt that even the faculty would recognize the strength of Grace&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prof. Warren, there has to be a misunderstanding,&#34;Gianna said, her voice tinged with desperation.&#34;Grace only came here after my uncle adopted her from some small-town orphanage. She hasn&#39;t even studied here for a full year.&#34; The thought that Grace could outperform her felt utterly impossible.Someone like Grace shouldn&#39;t have access to high-level resources, Gianna insisted inwardly. Surely the papers had been switched-maybe her own work was credited to Grace by mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on Gianna&#39;s not-so-subtle accusation,Terry&#39;s assistant cut in, his response sharp and unflinching. &#34;There&#39;s no mistake at all. The article belongs to Grace Miller. Do you honestly believe Professor Warren and I could mix up something so important? Both your paper and Grace Miller&#39;s will be posted for everyone to see. The truth will speak for itself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone who had once been at the top of the class and had become Terry&#39;s protégé, the assistant&#39;s confidence in Grace&#39;s work carried considerable weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Gianna refused to let go of her doubt, herlips parting to launch another protest, only for Terry to speak over her. &#34;Actually, there&#39;s another reason for my visit,&#34; he announced, his tone shifting the mood in the room. &#34;I&#39;m searching for an exceptional student to join my team in the future. If they agree to my terms, I can guarantee direct admission to Summit University-completely tuition-free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That announcement rippled through the classroom,igniting a surge of whispers and excitement. Rumors about Terry&#39;s visit had circulated for days, but hearing the offer firsthand sent a charge through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most students buzzed with the hope that the coveted spot might be theirs, though everyone expected Gianna would be chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s eyes lit up with hope and expectation as she looked to Terry, longing for confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single glance came her way. Terry&#39;s silence grew heavier by the second, slowly eroding her certainty. Gianna remembered introducing herself,convinced she&#39;d made an impression-so why was she being overlooked now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Terry put an end to any lingering confusion. &#34;To be clear, I&#39;ve already chosen who&#39;ll receive this opportunity. Grace Miller is my pick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That blunt revelation left Gianna speechless. Ellie,equally thrown, struggled to understand how everything had turned upside down. Why Grace, of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ellie, finally regaining her composure, sprang to her feet. She pointed to Gianna first. &#34;Prof. Warren, are you positive there&#39;s no mix-up? This is Gianna White...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shifted toward Grace. &#34;And that&#39;s Grace Miller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely Terry had made an error; nothing else made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of irritation crept into Terry&#39;s reply. &#34;I know exactly who&#39;s who. My eyes work just fine. One of them stands out for her looks, and I&#39;d never confuse the two... not for beauty, and certainly not for brains.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace&#39;s reputation for beauty was hardly a secret;Terry&#39;s words left no doubt who was the one stood out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gianna&#39;s face burned, mortified by the public dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if that weren&#39;t enough, Terry continued, &#34;Besides,Grace Miller was once my mentor. It&#39;s not just about who I want; it&#39;s whether she&#39;s willing to accept the offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in the world?! Was this some kind of twisted joke? Grace had actually been Terry&#39;s mentor once?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit with the same jolt as being told pigs had sprouted wings and taken to the skies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grace had done her best to slip beneath the radar,keeping her head down and her steps quiet. Still, no matter how carefully she moved, it was impossible to stay unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her fingers to her forehead and let out a long sigh, wishing for invisibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft complaint slipped from her lips. &#34;Would it kill you to keep that quiet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When people start doubting you, Grace, someone&#39;s got to set them straight. I wasn&#39;t about to let them keep questioning your talent.&#34; Terry offered a crooked smile, completely unapologetic.</p>
