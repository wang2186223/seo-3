                <p>Stacey gasped for air, her body threatening to give out, while Tessa looked just as shaken. Clinging to each other, Tessa&#39;s voice trembled as she stammered,&#34;Stacey, d-did you hear what he just said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth crashed down on Stacey, imnpossible to ignore. Rylie, the girl she&#39;d gone to such lengths to exile, had not sunk into hardship - she&#39;d risen to become the beloved granddaughter of the world&#39;s richest man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,it can&#39;t be... it just can&#39;t!&#34; Stacey&#39;s face lost all color, her lips quivering as she refused to believe what she was seeing. &#34;Why would Rylie end up with everything?&#34; The shock left her swaying, barely able to stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s instincts kicked in as she hurried to steady her.&#34;Stacey, hold on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold stare, Rylie watched their drama unfold,her mouth twisting into a sly, mocking grin. &#34;Relax She&#39;s having a fit, not dropping dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick gave a low, disdainful snort. Turning to the butler, he said, &#34;See them out before they make more of a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, the butler moved in, his tone courteous but unyielding. &#34;Ladies, I&#39;m afraid I have to ask you to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing which way the wind was blowing, Octavia quickly put space between herself and the others,slipping away without so much as a glance back at Tessa and Stacey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa,still holding up a faltering Stacey, kept her eyes downcast and left quietly, humiliation burning in her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy and panic flickered in Stacey&#39;s eyes as she cast one last look over her shoulder at Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t return the glance. She simply turned to Kendrick and said, &#34;Grandpa, I&#39;ll sign for my delivery and get ready for my appointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle nod, Kendrick said, &#34;Go on, Rylie. Don&#39;t keep them waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile lingered on Rylie&#39;s lips as she stepped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, in Deandre&#39;s study, Leland and Kenneth were fighting desperately to save what remained of their family businesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impatience radiated from Deandre as he leaned back in his chair, voice sharp and unforgiving. &#34;It was the Dury family who violated the agreement first, so my brother is within his rights to reclaim the project. The Kirks chose to ally themselves with the Durys-now you&#39;ll have to live with the consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat began to bead along Leland&#39;s brow. &#34;Mr. Owen,I think there&#39;s been a mistake. We&#39;re ready to make reparations for the losses. Couldn&#39;t you give us another opportunity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bitter, cold laugh slipped from Deandre.&#34;A second chance? Do you remember how your family tormented my sister all those years just to please Stacey? And now you stand here asking for mercy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;Your sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that exact moment, the door swung open and Marcus entered, his tone even and composed.&#34;Deandre, Grandfather wanted me to relay this:from today forward, neither the Kirks nor the Durys are allowed to set foot in Owen Group or residence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rebellious smirk flickered on Deandre&#39;s lips. &#34;About time. I&#39;m done with the polite act. Honestly, I&#39;m itching for a real fight with those two families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit Leland like a blow, draining the color from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kenneth,collapsed in defeat, stared at his hands and whispered, &#34;We&#39;re finished...there&#39;s nothing left...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold glint in his eye. Deandre rose and motioned to the door. &#34;You can show yourselves out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Rylie was collecting her delivery at the entrance when the Kirk family appeared again. From across the way, Tessa shouted, &#34;Rylie! I was wrong!Please, forgive me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word or a flicker of emotion, Rylie signed for her parcel, nausea rising in her throat, and walked away without looking back</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the Morgan residence, a quiet tension lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naval drills had just wrapped up, and Brock finished briefing Brad on military affairs before moving on to the latest Morgan family updates. &#34;The Owen family&#39;s $300 million business district bid just went public. Our team is already negotiating, and we expect the contract to be sealed next week. You&#39;ve also received an invitation to the medical school&#39;s hundredth anniversary, and there&#39;s a charity gala tonight. In two days, the aerospace tech expo opens-they&#39;re eager to know if you&#39;ll attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad fiddled with the military formations on the sand table before him, not even raising his head. &#34;I need to focus on recovery. Set aside everything except the Owen deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the most important items warranted his attention now; all distractions could wait</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Brock gave a crisp salute and slid the Owen project folder closer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A question drifted out as Brad&#39;s eyes narrowed.&#34;What&#39;s the latest from the Owens?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful pause stretched while Brock sorted his thoughts-Brad was surely asking about Rylie. &#34;Miss Owen&#39;s engagement to Fred Dury was called off not long ago. Then the Owens abruptly pulled ouut of the three-hundred-million project,plunging both the Kirk and Dury families into chaos. With bankruptcy on the horizon, they&#39;ve turned their bitterness toward Miss Owen. Moreover, the Wilde family - the giants in medicine - are watching her closely. Strangely,though, every shadow they sent her way has disappeared. Our guess? Miss Owen orchestrated their removal herself. The Owens seem to be in the dark.There are also a few assassination bounties on her head,but so far, no one has made a move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile ghosted across Brad&#39;s face as he tapped the table. &#34;She&#39;s the key to my survival, Brock. If she prefers a low profile, we&#39;ll see that she stays out of the limelight. Now, as for the Kirks and the Durys...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand swept across the sand table, plucking up a flag and tossing it aside with finality. &#34;Clean up the mess for her. Make sure those families don&#39;t get another chance to rise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock gave a firm nod. &#34;Understood, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the gala drew near. Paola-after taking her time with hair and makeup-finally called Rylie. Her tone was sweetly apologetic. &#34;Rylie, sorry! My styling ran late today. If I send the car now, we&#39;ll miss the event.Would you mind getting there on your own?&#34;</p>
