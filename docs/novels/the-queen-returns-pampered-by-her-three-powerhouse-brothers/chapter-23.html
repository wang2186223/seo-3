                <p>News of the Owen family&#39;s recent search for a missing sister in Crolens drifted through Rylie&#39;s mind,giving her a hunch about this stranger, though she wasn&#39;t fully convinced. &#34;Are you supposed to be my brother?&#34; she questioned, voice uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A step closer brought the man within arm&#39;s reach. He leaned in just enough to flash a warm grin.&#34;You beat me to it, Rylie. It&#39;s a pleasure meeting you-Deandre Owen,your brother.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No words sprang to Rylie&#39;s lips; she just stared,momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the impressive lineup of luxury vehicles,she eventually said, &#34;The Kirks always told me my parents lived somewhere remote and unremarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That story didn&#39;t match up with the immense wealth on display. Rylie couldn&#39;t  reconcile the image of the Owens with the idea of a family tucked away inobscurity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a beat to gather his thoughts, Deandre offered an explanation. &#34;In a sense, you&#39;re not entirely wrong. Our great-grandfather&#39;s estate sits tucked away in the mountains, far from the city. The old Owen homestead has actually been turned into a museum these days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie needed a moment to process that, letting the silence stretch between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her hesitation, Deandre smiled again and explained, &#34;Grandpa insisted I make your first homecoming something special. The whole convoy and helicopter crew? That&#39;s just a small welcome party, nothing too extravagant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her gaze travel along the endless procession of vehicles and gave a measured nod. &#34;It&#39;s impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While most would have been speechless at such a show of power, Deandre found himself surprised by how unfazed his sister seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention shifted to the motorcycle beside her.&#34;We&#39;ll head home now. I&#39;ll have someone take care of your bike and see it safely delivered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, let&#39;s go,&#34; Rylie answered, without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she climbed into the helicopter, another passenger caught her eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting a familiar figure, she blinked in disbelief.&#34;You&#39;re here too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad lounged comfortably in the seat, one leg crossed over the other. The sharp lines of his designer suit only emphasized his striking build.Shadows danced across his face, but as he tilted forward, the chiseled set of his jaw came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad leaned back with a hint of a smile. &#34;Deandre used my convoy for the day, so l decided to come along.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked in Deandre&#39;s eyes. &#34;So, you two already know each other?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie found her place in the seat and answered, &#34;You could say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre continued, offering some context,&#34;The Owen family doesn&#39;t have many resources here in Crolens. Most of the time, we stay away. Only the Morgan family keeps such a large helicopter fleet, so Brad was generous enough to let us borrow it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his high rank in the navy, Brad was always surrounded by security. Admirals like him, constantly targeted by enemies, needed this level of protection on every trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent nod from Rylie showed that she understood.She kept her relationship with Brad to herself in the presence of the Owens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the helicopters began to ascend and the convoy snaked its way out of the neighborhood,guards at the villa community swung every last gate closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, only the front entrance would be in use,but today, the Owens&#39; procession required every gate to be thrown open just to clear the path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small group of security staff clustered near the fence, murmuring among themselves, &#34;If my eyes didn&#39;t deceive me, that was the Kirk girl who just got ousted-she&#39;s the one leaving by helicopter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Media coverage had turned Rylie&#39;s exit intoheadline news for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards glanced from his phone to the sky,recognizing Rylie&#39;s motorcycle being loaded up.&#34;Word around here is she&#39;s not even a Kirk by blood.Her real folks supposedly live out in some poor village.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another shook his head at the spectacle. &#34;If that&#39;s true, this kind of sendoff doesn&#39;t fit at all. Her real family must be a big deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A third guard chuckled under his breath. &#34;Well, if that&#39;s the case, the Kirks will have plenty of regrets soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While these whispers carried through the security post, inside the Kirk estate, the family focused on entertaining their guests, unaware of the gossip just outside. They did, however, notice the helicopters slicing through the sky above their mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in the Kirk family paid much attention,missing the fact that the helicopters had anything to do with Rylie. Once the formal announcement of Stacey and Fred&#39;s engagement was made, Casper turned to Fred and asked with practiced politeness,&#34;I heard you locked down a three hundred million dollar deal with the Owens. Is there a chance we could join in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred responded without missing a beat, &#34;That&#39;s what I hoped for as well, but the partnership is a hefty commitment. The exact terms still need to be hammered out with the Owen family. If you&#39;d like to collaborate, I&#39;m happy to put in a good word for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement shone in Casper&#39;s eyes. &#34;That&#39;s excellent news! | appreciate it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep within Crolens stood Serenity Manor, a name known only to the city&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucked into the heart of the city&#39;s most valuable real estate, Serenity Manor stood apart- a sanctuary where just four families held the central grounds,with a handful of smaller homes scattered beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grand estate-style residences dominated the landscape, each one private and discreet,surrounded by breathtaking vistas. The cost of entry was so high that only the country&#39;s wealthiest could hope to call this place home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, Rylie had come here once, when Brad needed her medical expertise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching down on the helipad beside a vineyard,she stepped out to a striking welcome -- rows of staff and guards formed an honor guard, voices ringing out as one. &#34;Welcome home, Miss Owen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after her, Deandre exclaimed, &#34;Grandfather purchased this place years back, hoping you&#39;d spend holidays and summers with us. When you disappeared, the manor felt empty, almost haunted.None of us wanted to return, so we left everything in the care of distant relatives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bittersweet ache, Deandre studied the calm strength in her face. &#34;What you missed, we&#39;ll make sure you have again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the helicopter, Brad watched as Rylie walked away. He made a quick call, instructing, &#34;Send a gift on my behalf to the neighboring villa when you get the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, life carried on at the main Owen estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick claimed the main seat on the expansive sofa, leaning heavily on his cane while his gaze lingered at the front entrance. A circle of relatives-Felix, Marcus, and several others-clustered around him,filling the room with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare occasion had drawn every branch of the Owen family together, all eager to witness Rylie&#39;s homecoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension crackled in the formal hall as Paola Garrett leaned over, her voice just a whisper. &#34;Rylie&#39;s spent so many years away. She must have gone through a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her left, a teenager whose features mirrored hers wore a deep scowl, muttering, &#34;Do we know how long she&#39;ll be staying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at her mother, Paola replied in a low voice,&#34;However long she remains, this is still her family. We owe her kindness. After all, she&#39;s our cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gentle assurance drifted through the room,catching Kendrick&#39;s attention.&#34;Paola, your poise and grace continue to impress me,&#34; he remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blushing at the praise, Paola replied, &#34;Grandpa,I learned it all from you and my cousins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her magnanimity and elegance stemmed from not considering the returning cousin a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stories had spread that Rylie came from humble beginnings, lacking the polish of the city. Such rumors only reinforced Paola&#39;s place - Rylie&#39;s presence would highlight her own charm and standing even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Kendrick offered his compliment lightly, his eyes never left the threshold. At last, the long wait ended as two silhouettes appeared in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre&#39;s voice rang out clear and bright.&#34;Everyone, Rylie has come home!&#34;</p>
