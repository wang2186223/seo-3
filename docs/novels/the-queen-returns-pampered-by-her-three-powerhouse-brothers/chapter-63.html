                <p>Rylie gave the patient a quick once-over. After scribbling just a few words into his chart, she shut it with a calm finality. &#34;Alright. We&#39;re done here. Let&#39;s wait for the official results.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland blinked in surprise. &#34;That&#39;s it? You&#39;re finished already? So, what&#39;s wrong with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave him a small smile. &#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer only deepened Leland&#39;s confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the room, the other participants were still busy whispering about the patient&#39;s symptoms.Rylie had been the last to enter, yet she was the first to walk out-barely fifteen minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they saw her, the others dropped their serious expressions and began smirking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that was quick. Bet she didn&#39;t understand a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just look at Leland. Poor guy&#39;s face says it all. They totally missed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita took it all in and felt her confidence rise.Without Selah guiding her, what threat could that girl possibly pose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Brad sat calmly at the head of the table. The butler brought over the final results, which Brock then handed off to a few seasoned physicians from the military hospital. Their review didn&#39;t take long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave the results a brief glance and barely reacted. &#34;Go ahead. Announce it,&#34; he told Brock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock gave a small nod and left the room for the second-floor landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone,&#34; he began, his voice firm and steady.&#34;You&#39;ve all completed your assessments. The results are with me now. Ms. Wilde. Miss Wilde.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita stood without hesitation, her lips fighting back a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>flaws, which places them in second.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Second? Evita&#39;s smile stiffened in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the only one caught off guard. The room stirred with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Wildes didn&#39;t take first place, then who did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could be Rory,&#34; someone whispered. &#34;He&#39;s from the military hospital. He might know the evaluators the Morgans brought in. That could&#39;ve helped him score higher.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still... this is Mr. Morgan&#39;s health we&#39;re talking about. I doubt they&#39;d risk any kind of favoritism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs filled the space, but Brock didn&#39;t offer any answers just yet. Instead, he turned to the crowd.&#34;Miss Owen, would you mind stepping forward and shedding some light for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie popped the last bit of her candy in her mouth,wiped her hands, and stood up without hurry.Everyone watched as she made her way to the front.&#34;Sure,&#34; she said, her voice calm. &#34;What exactly would you like me to explain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock unfolded the chart she&#39;d written in and glanced at the contents with a faint smile. &#34;It&#39;s the third patient&#39;s condition we&#39;d like to understand. And your treatment plan, specifically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People leaned forward, eyes narrowing as they scanned the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one line. &#34;Get plenty of rest and stay hydrated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest?&#34; someone echoed. &#34;That&#39;s it? That&#39;s the treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously? The Morgans signed off on this? How could they take that seriously?&#34;</p>
