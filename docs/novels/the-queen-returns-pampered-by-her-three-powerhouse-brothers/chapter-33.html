                <p>News reached Britton&#39;s team, and Rylie heard it too. She let out a sharp laugh. &#34;They want to investigate me? I haven&#39;t even dealt with what they did back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out on the racetrack, the judges and drivers had already gathered. As Rylie arrived, someone from Phillip&#39;s team pointed at her. &#34;She was our racer. She&#39;s been a key part of our lineup for years. She knows our system inside out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie crossed her arms, a bitter smile pulling at her mouth. &#34;Is that so? Then how come my name&#39;s not listed among your champions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judges went through the records. They found nothing. &#34;In the official race entries, the only female member from your team was Stacey Kirk,&#34; one of them said. &#34;Rylie appeared only as a substitute. She wasn&#39;t even technically qualified to race under regulation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the crowd, fans from Phillip&#39;s side started shouting for an explanation. They demanded answers from both the judges and Rylie. Some even threatened to have Britton&#39;s team disqualified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise grew louder. Rylie grabbed the nearest microphone. A loud feedback screech cut through the tension. All eyes turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Phillip&#39;s team without flinching. &#34;Yes, I raced with them. Every season. I was there from their very first win. But why is it only today, after | switched teams, that I broke a racing record? The truth is, I never got to finish an official race. I was always subbed in, just to stall for Stacey, so she could cross the line and take the win. They got the titles. They stood on the podium. I wasn&#39;t even allowed in the photo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice remained even as she continued, &#34;The trophies were earned with my laps, but never meant for me.So why is it a crime to leave? Why should I stay loyal to people who never treated me like a real teammate? Britton gave me a real spot. I ran the final leg, I crossed the finish line, and I won a race that actually counted. If you were me, would you stay with Phillip&#39;s team? Or would you choose someone who saw your worth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything she said cut straight to the point. There was no defense left for Phillip&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in the crowd were stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went back and reviewed old race data. Rylie had been in every championship. She was always the fastest one. She built their lead every year. In contrast, Stacey&#39;s results were consistently poor, always at the bottom. Had it not been for Rylie, who widened the gap with other racers, Stacey wouldn&#39;t have been able to win first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd began to understand. &#34;So Phillip&#39;s team kept winning, but never broke a record because Stacey was slowing them down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder Rylie&#39;s lap shattered the record. She was the reason they won at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she wasn&#39;t even listed as an official member? No contract? No rules binding her? Then she&#39;s free to switch teams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More and more voices turned on Phillip&#39;s team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a joke. She carried them for years, and they didn&#39;t even let her on the podium.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same team, same race. Yet only Stacey got the spotlight. That&#39;s not a team. That&#39;s favoritism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd started calling them out. Members of Phillip&#39;s team stood frozen, their heads down,unable to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the judges made their ruling. Britton&#39;s team would keep their victory. Rylie&#39;s membership was confirmed as valid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillipo had never faced such a crushing loss. But he had no way to deny it-everything Rylie said was true. He had never imagined that she would care so deeply about being left out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd wasn&#39;t quiet about it either. Every shout of &#34;favoritism&#34; landed squarely on him. They all accused him of choosing Stacey over Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie dropped the mic without a word. She walked straight up to Stacey, lifted her hand, and punched her hard across the face. Gasps echoed through the stands. A few people stood and cheered. &#34;Good hit! That freeloader had it coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey screamed as she hit the ground. Phillip rushed over, grabbed Rylie&#39;s arm, and held her back.&#34;Stop it,Rylie! What&#39;s wrong with you? We&#39;ve already lost everything. Isn&#39;t that enough? What else do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I want?&#34; Rylie&#39;s voice cut like glass. Her eyes were burning cold. &#34;She tried to kil me on that turn. And now I can&#39;t even land a punch? Maybe I ought to show you how it feels too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey wiped her lip. Blood streaked her hand. Her voice trembled. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean to-I swear it wasn&#39;t on purpose!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jake stepped up fast. &#34;That&#39;s enough, Rylie! You&#39;re out of line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another member of Phillip&#39;s team added, &#34;Exactly, Stacey just wanted to win the race too badly.Mistakes happen during the process. How can you blame her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton stepped in front of Rylie, his voice steady. &#34;You&#39;re blaming her? That move Stacey pulled-anyone with a brain knows what danger it could bring. She didn&#39;t slow down when she should have.She waited until Rylie was beside her, then tapped the brakes on the outer lane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a call came through to the judges from the VIP lounge. They looked at one another,then turned to review the footage again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension broke when one of the judges grabbed the microphone. &#34;We&#39;ve just received a report from a spectator. Driver Six from Phillip&#39;s team-Stacey Kirk- has been found in violation of the rules.After reviewing the footage again, we have a ruling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Phillip&#39;s team was on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jake spun around, eyes wide. &#34;What?! A report? Who did that?!&#34;</p>
