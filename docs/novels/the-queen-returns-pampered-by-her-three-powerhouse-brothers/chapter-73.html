                <p>ylie suddenly let out a laugh. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the doors of the research institute burst open. Deandre&#39;s cheerful voice echoed through the entrance. &#34;Rylie, your classmates said you were here -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze when he saw Brad looking messy and half-dressed. His smile vanished, replaced by a scowl.Muscles tense, he stepped forward and pulled Rylie behind him. &#34;What the hell, Brad! Are you messing around with my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre swung a heavy punch, but Brad caught it easily. &#34;You&#39;ve misunderstood,&#34; Brad said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Misunderstood? Your boxers are on that chair,and there&#39;s a tub right there! You call that a misunderstanding? You sure know how to enjoy yourself! Deandre raised his leg to kick, but Brad blocked it like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, a little thrown by Deandre&#39;s anger, muttered,&#34;Even if I was indeed intimate with your sister, what&#39;s wrong with that? She&#39;s already twenty, and she has every right to have a boyfriend. Why are you so furious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie saw Deandre&#39;s face flush with rage. She quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back. &#34;Deandre,calm down. It&#39;s really not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre turned to her. Her calm expression stopped him cold. Something inside him cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely spent time with her since coming back,and now Brad was taking her away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back, grabbed her shoulders, and leaned in. His voice dropped with urgency. &#34;Rylie, listen to me. You can&#39;t be with Brad. He&#39;s always traveling for work - sometimes gone for years. When he&#39;s not away, he&#39;s dodging assassins. And now, he&#39;s sick.He doesn&#39;t have much time left. Are you really going to waste your youth on someone like him? I don&#39;t support this. Break up. You have to break up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tilted her head toward Brad with a sigh. &#34;Look at the mess you&#39;ve made.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s smile remained, but his eyes turned cold.Deandre&#39;s words had hit him right in the gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He worried Rylie might take them seriously. But there was no space between them for half-truths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deandre, he&#39;s lying to you,&#34; Rylie said, patting her brother&#39;s arm and pointing to the cluttered lab bench. &#34;I was mixing a formula for him. I&#39;m treating Mr. Morgan&#39;s illness, and I told him to soak in the ice bucket. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Deandre notice Rylie&#39;s lab coat,hanging loosely like a prop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still a university student. Sure,she&#39;d helped Rory with Felix&#39;s tumor surgery, but Brad&#39;s case was on another level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre looked at her seriously. &#34;Rylie, stop lying.My team already analyzed Brad&#39;s condition. We couldn&#39;t treat him. How can you? You&#39;re still a student. You want to date? Fine, I&#39;ll protect you. But He continued, &#34;Even if Brad dies and leaves you a fortune, we don&#39;t need his money. You can&#39;t throw away your future like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie let out a breath. &#34;I&#39;m not playing around,Deandre. What will make you believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre&#39;s tone deepened. &#34;Any drug used on Brad needs rounds of research and trials. You&#39;ve been busy with school and parties. When did you have time to develop a cure? And trials need donors and high-level approval. You don&#39;t even have a license.How could you do all that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie paused. By her official identity, she didn&#39;t have a license. But on the dark web, as the Healing Hand,she did. Telling him that would only make things Worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brad stepped in. &#34;I trust her. And she&#39;s already injected the medication.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre blinked. &#34;Injected? Was it tested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. He&#39;s my test subject,&#34; Rylie answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stunned Deandre. Rylie braced for his anger-she had clearly broken the rules. But instead of scolding, Deandre went silent. He seemed lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked at Brad and said solemnly, &#34;Whatever she&#39;s done, I&#39;ll take the blame. If you still have a conscience, don&#39;t let her carry the weight when you&#39;re gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie was taken aback. Her brother was willing to take the fall for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened. &#34;Deandre, Mr. Sean Morgan knows that I want Mr. Morgan to be my patient, and he gave his permission. If you&#39;re still unsure, call him.Ask directly. Then you&#39;ll know if I&#39;m telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was steady and sincere. There was no sign of a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre hesitated. He didn&#39;t know what to believe anymore. Brad, now dressed, spoke calmly. &#34;I&#39;ll head back. My father will talk to Mr. Kendrick Owen soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for my illness, it&#39;s in fate&#39;s hands. No matter what happens, Rylie won&#39;t be dragged into it.&#34;</p>
