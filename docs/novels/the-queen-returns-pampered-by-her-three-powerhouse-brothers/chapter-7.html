                <p>Rylie couldn&#39;t help thinking that the Kirk family had lost touch with reality. She slipped past Leland,making her way toward the pharmacy entrance,only for him to step in frontof her and block her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A firm grip on her arm stopped her progress as Leland warned, &#34;You don&#39;t belong here. Stirring up trouble with these powerful people could land the Kirk family in hot water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a car idling nearby, a young woman leaned out the window, her eyes trained on Leland. &#34;Did you get what I asked for, Mr. Kirk? Your brother doesn&#39;t have time to waste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Leland let go of Rylie&#39;s arm, tossed a final warning her way, and headed off toward the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s eyes fell on the medicine he clutched, and despite knowing that she was overstepping, her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>conscience won out. &#34;If you care about Nicolas, don&#39;t give him that. It&#39;ll do more harm than good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold voice shot back from the car window, &#34;You&#39;re just a child. Our pharmacy&#39;s reputation is built on generations of trust. If Mr. Kirk doubts us, he&#39;s free to walk away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, Leland hustled to the car,apologized profusely, then whipped around and snapped at Rylie. &#34;Nicolas&#39;s health only went downhill because of your so-called cure. Stacey searched everywhere for a Wilde family doctor, and thanks to their connections, we finally got medicine from Aetheris! Keep spreading lies, and I&#39;ll see to it you&#39;re banned from Crolens for good.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tires squealed as the car sped off, leaving Rylie standing alone. She simply shrugged. She&#39;d spoken her truth-whether they listened was no longer her problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping inside the pharmacy, Rylie was greeted by a respectful bow from the pharmacist. &#34;Miss Kirk,welcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a casual air, Rylie set her compound on the desk. &#34;Freddy, make sure this is prepped safely. Tag it at three million. Put it up for sale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark of excitement lit Freddy Turner&#39;s eyes. &#34;This batch looks phenomenal.First time you&#39;ve made this,isn&#39;t it? Word is the Morgan family has been searching everywhere for Nexo-7. They were even here yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie shook her head. &#34;Hadn&#39;t heard. I just managed to finish a batch today. Use it for whatever prescriptions you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Rylie added, &#34;And another thing - revoke Leland&#39;s VIP privileges. From now on, he pays full price for everything here, no exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A satisfied grin spread across Freddy&#39;s face. &#34;I&#39;ve been wanting to say that myself. Every year,you pour money into the Kirk family, buying premium supplements and smoothing their path, yet they never once value what you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Preparing to take the medicine downstairs, Freddy paused, turning back with a thought. &#34;Almost forgot -Ms. Hobbes is next door again, handing out free consultations and grabbing extra supplies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie dismissed it with a flick of her hand. &#34;Let her do as she pleases. Don&#39;t charge for it. Call it charity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was halfway to the door when it swung open once more, and two imposing officers in military dress strode inside, medals gleaming on their chests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, they made their way to the counter.here for Nexo-7-do you have any?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they spotted the viaI in Freddy&#39;s hand, both officers&#39; eyes widened. They wasted no time flashing their credentiaIs. &#34;This is for the Morgan family. We need to buy that Nexo-7 immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freddy set the price without hesitation. &#34;Three million. It&#39;ll be ready for pickup in two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of panic entered one officer&#39;s voice. &#34;That won&#39;t do-Mr. Morgan can&#39;t wait that long. We need it right now; it&#39;s urgent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie guessed that Brad must be critically ill. With so many invitations sent out, no doctor could save him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory&#39;s desperate call echoed in her memory. Rylie stepped in, her tone direct. &#34;You can&#39;t administer Nexo-7 straight away. It&#39;s toxic in its current form and needs special processing first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation colored the officer&#39;s reply, saying,&#34;We don&#39;t have time-this is a life-or-death emergency!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick calculation, Rylie made her decision.&#34;Freddy, box up the Nexo-7. I&#39;ll go with them and oversee the preparation myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freddy gave a brisk nod. &#34;Understood, Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officers shot each other uncertain glances,clearly taken aback by how deferential Freddy was to Rylie. One let out a disbelieving snort. &#34;You can&#39;t be serious. What&#39;s a kid like you going to do for us? Why not send out someone with real authority?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging by Rylie&#39;s youthful appearance, neither man expected her to offer anything remotely useful.</p>
