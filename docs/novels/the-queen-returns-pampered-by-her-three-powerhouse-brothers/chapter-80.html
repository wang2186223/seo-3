                <p>Brad lifted a brow and gave Rylie a smug grin. &#34;No thank-you for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your help,&#34; she replied. Rylie turned toward him, their heads nearly brushing. The narrow space between them felt charged, like a held breath waiting to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their eyes locked, Brad&#39;s breath hitched. &#34;Alright then. I&#39;m only here because Deandre asked me to watch over you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie remembered she had been an adult for quite some time now, and Brad&#39;s words sounded like an excuse. Deandre clearly didn&#39;t want Brad to have much contact with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not seeing the point in dragging out the exchange, she let it drop. The house lights had dimmed already, so she eased into the cushions, letting the hush of the room settle in. Faint whispers came from the row behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man&#39;s voice carried behind her seat, easy to catch in the quiet. &#34;Paola&#39;s got serious talent. The revision I requested is almost complete. She&#39;s debuting the piece tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man he was talking to lowered his voice. &#34;Isn&#39;t that the composition you&#39;re saving for your next film?Spencer,you&#39;re really going to release it early?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer nodded and replied, &#34;It was her suggestion. She&#39;s doing it for me, really. Marcus is known across the world. I&#39;m stilllocal. She thought this concert would be a good chance to give my work some exposure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His companion spoke with a nod in his tone. &#34;Paola has both charm and skill. She&#39;s quite the package.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie picked up every word. Her hearing had always been sharp, and nothing about the exchange escaped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around and looked straight at Spencer. &#34;You&#39;re right, sir. My cousin works on her music in the study at home. I&#39;ve seen the pages piling up with edits. She&#39;s really put the effort in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer stared at her for a beat, trying to place her, then recognition clicked.&#34;Ah.Miss Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been there during the earlier incident. He hadn&#39;t warmed up to her since, so his response came out tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her expression pleasant. &#34;She stays up late some nights. I&#39;ve seen her go over the same piece again and again, just to meet your expectations, Mr. Aguilar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s expression softened slightly. He gave a slow nod. &#34;Yes, the final version was pieced together in the library. That&#39;s where I found it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then added, &#34;It turned out nothing like the original draft. The shift in style was dramatic. It really does show she might carry Marcus&#39; legacy forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tilted her head and smiled faintly.that right? So you must&#39;ve heard the piano but dídn&#39;t actually see who was playing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer tilted hishead,clearly puzzled.&#34;Why would you say something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie offered a light reply. it&#39;s nothing serious. I just think you&#39;ve got a sharp ear, Mr. Aguilar.Maybe next time, you could hear me play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say the rest out loud. In truth, she believed he lacked the discernment to read between the lines.For someone like him, the deeper truths stayed hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer took her words as a gentle nudge. He assumed she was hinting at composing for his film.Wanting to avoid any commitment, he gave a polite refusal. &#34;I&#39;ve been swamped lately, but maybe in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a nod and kept her smile small. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who understood music could tell from Paola&#39;s discarded drafts that her skills had limits. Even so,Spencer remained convinced that the sudden shift in her compositions came from her brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie quietly wondered how he&#39;d react once the truth came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad said nothing the whole time. He kept his gaze on Rylie, noticing the way her lips curved just slightly and how her eyes sparkled with something sly. There was a playfulness in her, the kind that hid its claws.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had finally figured her out. Rylie always wore a soft expression when she was laying a trap. She made people feel safe, just long enough to strike when it counted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marcus stepped into the light. His coat was deep purple, his short hair neatly styled. He looked every bit the refined artist. Calm.Poised. Confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began speaking, and the room stilled. His words, paired with his gentle air, pulled in every woman seated nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept toward the VIP section. &#34;Lately, there&#39;s been a lot to celebrate in our home. One joy stands out- a treasure | thought I&#39;d lost. She&#39;s here with us tonight. She gave me the spark to write this next piece. I hope it speaks to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet stir passed through the crowd, especially among the women. Many turned their heads, their eyes landing on Paola. Some did it without thinking. Others meant to. Isabella leaned in and whispered, a little too loudly, &#34;Marcus really does favor Paola. He invites her to perform, then calls her a treasure in front of everyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola tried to wave her off. &#34;Stop, Isabella. He never said that to me. Maybe he was talking about the other guests. Maybe even Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella giggled and nudged her.&#34;Come on. We all know how modest you are. Fine, just let him do the bragging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola smiled, saying nothing more. She soaked in the stares, her cheeks glowing as eyes flicked toward her from all directions. Tonight, she was the only woman who would be performing on stage. The rest didn&#39;t matter. Not Rylie&#39;s stunts. Not anything else. She was born to be at the center. No one could outshine her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she basked in the illusion, a sharp screech tore through the auditorium from Marcus&#39; microphone.</p>
