                <p>With the students now scattered, Timothy leveled a cold glare at Rylie. &#34;You&#39;ve really crossed the line this time. You&#39;re officially done with my research group.Expect a written notice soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his words with a casual shrug, wondering if this meant that she was finally free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it appeared that fate had other plans - no sooner had she stepped away than another obstacle emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman appeared from the shadows, eyes locked not on Rylie but on the glowing vial in her hand.&#34;That&#39;s Nexo-7, isn&#39;t it?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie studied the slender glass vial she carried.Swirling inside, the pale blue liquid shimmered faintly.&#34;You&#39;re right. That&#39;s what it is. Is there a reason you ask?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor of excitement crept into the woman&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You made it yourself? How did you manage that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie offered a simple answer, barely interested.&#34;I just followed standard protocol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s enthusiasm only grew. Clutching Rylie&#39;s wrist, she continued, &#34;I&#39;ve spent three years trying to perfect this formula - lost count of my failed attempts and ran out of materials ages ago.Can you look at my records and tell me where I went wrong? I really need Nexo-7 for my research!&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word around the institute was that Brad, the youngest Morgan, was battling a rare genetic illness,and only Nexo-7 could ease his suffering. For most,producing such a compound without flaws was nearly impossible - tiny miscalculations could ruin everything. Yet the sample in Rylie&#39;s hand was pristine, the envy of any chemist. The woman knew that landing this compound could mean both scientific acclaim and a massive payout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s frown deepened, though her voice stayed even. &#34;There&#39;s nothing mysterious about it. All it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>takes is precise ratios and following instructions to the letter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman refused to back down. She whipped out a business card, thrusting it toward Rylie. &#34;I&#39;m Vivian Estrada, from the Biomedical Research Institute next door. Join my lab! I&#39;ll get your work into leading journals, let you spearhead your own project, and you&#39;ll have every resource you need - bonuses included!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the name &#34;Vivian Estrada,&#34; Stacey stiffened,her eyes narrowing in disbelief. Ofall people, Vivian - an internationally acclaimed scientist from the Biomedical Research Institute - was suddenly focused on Rylie, all because of a single vial of compound? It was maddening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new strategy formed in Stacey&#39;s mind. She slipped into a wounded, delicate act and leaned in,murmuring, &#34;Professor Estrada, that compound actually came from our lab&#39;s group work. Rylie took it without getting approval from our teammates or instructor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s eyebrows shot up as she scrutinized Stacey and her companions. &#34;Is that so? Are you saying this student isn&#39;t the one who produced it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man from earlier jumped at the opportunity to add, &#34;Exactly. Rylie did help, but Stacey did most of the work - she&#39;s always here first and leaves last.She managed all the data, every experiment,and honestly, if Nexo-7 was made in our lab, i&#39;s thanks to her efforts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a show of humility, Stacey let a gentle smile play across her lips. &#34;Please, it was just teamwork.I was only doing what | could.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing which way the wind was blowing, Timothy didn&#39;t hesitate to add his own endorsement.&#34;Stacey&#39;s our star, the backbone of the whole team.Rylie, on the other hand, rarely pulls her weight and won&#39;t even bother keeping up with the lab notes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie scoffed, cold amusement flickering across her face. She had no interest in fighting for credit and simply turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian barely waited for Rylie to step away before pulling Stacey aside. &#34;If that&#39;s true,then come with me now. We&#39;ll try to reproduce Nexo-7 in my lab. If you manage it, every offer I made to her stands for you too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fleeting gleam of satisfaction danced in Stacey&#39;s eyes,though outwardly she wore nothing but humble composure.&#34;Thank you,Professor Estrada. I promise to give it everything I have,&#34; she replied, bowing her head with demure grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze tracked Rylie&#39;s retreat, an inner smirk flickering behind her polite expression. Surely synthesizing a compound couldn&#39;t be that complicated. She&#39;d already memorized Rylie&#39;s process in secret - heat, stir, toss in the catalyst.Rylie could strut all she wanted, but in the end, she,Stacey, would have the last laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, Rylie faced two more final exams. She breezed through each in under thirty minutes,handing in her papers and leaving the room ahead of everyone else. Curious glances and quiet sneers</p>
                
                
                
                <p>followed her; classmates assumed that she must have filled her sheets with guesswork, as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let them talk. Rylie barely noticed their judgment.In truth, she could ace those tests without breaking a sweat. Once, she had deliberately tanked her grades to help Stacey&#39;s reputation, but those days were over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wasting a moment, Rylie revved up her motorcycle and sped away from campus, making her way to Aetheris Pharmacy - a name whispered in elite circles, famous for its exclusivity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried Nexo-7 with her as she pushed openthe glass door framed in gold. A subtle blend of herbal and high-end perfume scents greeted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight flooded a spacious lobby, where a dazzling crystal chandelier hung from the soaring ceiling,fracturing the light into thousands of shimmering stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the faint scent of medicine in the air, a stranger might have mistaken the space for an</p>
                
                
                
                <p>upscale boutique or a five-star hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With confidence in her step, Rylie made for the counter - only to cross paths with Leland as he emerged from a side hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scowl darkened Leland&#39;s face the moment he spotted her. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t you be sitting your freshman finals right now? Why are you here? Are you following me? Do you even realize what kind of place this is?Leave before you cause trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie met his hostility with a dramatic eye roll. &#34;Don&#39;t flatter yourself. I didn&#39;t follow you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s words came out cold, dripping with contempt. &#34;If you&#39;re going to make up stories,at least try something plausible. What business would a freshman possibly have at Aetheris Pharmacy?There&#39;s no way you&#39;re getting past the front desk without a VIP card. Be honest-did you really trail me here just to beg me for help, hoping I would persuade Nicolas to take you back? Let me save you the trouble. You&#39;re not setting foot in the Kirk family residence again until you own up to everything you</p>
