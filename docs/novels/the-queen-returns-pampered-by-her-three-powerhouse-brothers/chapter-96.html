                <p>Stetson paused deliberately, sweeping his gaze across the venue to ensure all eyes were on him before continuing, &#34;That said, I believe the younger generation deserves a chance to explain themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his words seemed impartial, each carried a subtle edge, insinuating the possibility of Rylie&#39;s dishonesty while positioning himself as the gracious elder willing to offer her a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey immediately picked up on the message. Her eyes reddened.&#34;Professor Ahmed, you&#39;re far too kind!But academic misconduct is a serious offense that cannot be overlooked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Rylie, her voice quivering, nearly breaking into tears. &#34;Rylie, if you come clean now,there&#39;s still a chance people might forgive you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you done?&#34; Rylie&#39;s soft voice cut through the room, commanding attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey,incensed by her composure, raised her voice &#34;What is that attitude supposed to mean? Are you trying to justify fabricating your data?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of urgency. Rylie pluigged the USB drive into the laptop and pulled up a video. Since everyone seems 50 interested in my research process</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large screen lit up with high-definition footage Rylie appeared in a lab coat, operating a unique instrument. The timestamp marked the video as two months old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that...?&#34; An elderly professor on the judges&#39; panel suddenly rose. &#34;That&#39;s a quantum-level microscope!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of astonishment swept through the room. The advanced equipment was rare - only a handful existed in the country. Even Stetson&#39;s lab didn&#39;t have one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie opened a second video. &#34;These are logs from my research at the school&#39;s experimental lab, the one formerly overseen by Timothy Powell. Starting from two months ago, I&#39;ve meticulously documented all my research processes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen showed her meticulously recording data,visibly worn out from sleepless nights, with dark circles etched under her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s impossible!&#34; Stacey objected, her voice rising again. &#34;Powell&#39;s Lab doesn&#39;t even have that kind of equipment!I&#39;ve never seen it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie shot her a calm, indifferent glance. &#34;of courseyou haven&#39;t l bought it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey froze. &#34;That&#39;s ridiculous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls it?&#34; Rylie responded with a faint, mocking smileYou&#39;re well aware that l can afford it. Your Kirk familystill owes me tens of millions in unpaid medicalexpenses</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted in murmurs, and Stacey&#39;s faceflushed with embarrassment. Her temper boiled overShe&#39;s lying! Don&#39;t believe her! She even stole hercousin&#39;s piano compositions-she&#39;s a fraud! Nothingshe says is true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Enough!&#34; the chairman of the judges interjected, histone firm. &#34;Rylie&#39;s findings have been reviewed andaffirmed byseven independent experts:And nowshe&#39;s presented complete documentation of her workWe will not continue to discredit her simply becauseof her youth and brilliance. There is no flaw in herresearch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned sharply toward Stetson. &#34;Professor Ahmedcontrol your student. This is an academic platformnot a courtroom for baseless accusations. Don&#39;t bringinternet gossip into a scientific evaluation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing center stage, Rylie cast a cool glance at thepale-faced Stacey and the shaken Stetson before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shifting her eyes toward the back of the hall</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stood there, arms folded, a trace of amusement glinting in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Rylie&#39;s lips. She raised the trophy high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had claimed this victory, thoroughly and on her own terms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the ceremony, Rylie stepped outside and saw Brad&#39;s car still parked nearby. After a brief pause,she walked over, opened the door, and got in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad leaned back against the leather seat, relaxed &#34;Let&#39;s grab a meal together. We&#39;ve got something to celebrate, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie weighed the medal in her hand. &#34;This?&#34; She tossed it casually into her pocket. &#34;The prize money won&#39;t even cover half my project costs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad replied, &#34;Isn&#39;t the rest of the funding coming from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie looked over at him. &#34;Should&#39;I be thanking you,then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chuckled. &#34;Steak?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No I&#39;m eating at HaloFlow Pharmacy tonight, she said,then hesitated briefly. &#34;You want to come?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered the invitation out of politeness, not expecting him to accept. But he nodded without the slightest hesitation. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a slight nod in return. Well... alright then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the way, Rylie took a few calls, some from contacts in the community near the military compound, and one from Clive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her care, Clive&#39;s legs had shown significant improvement. Word of his recovery was spreading,and the call felt hesitant, almost awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry to bother you,Dr.Owen,&#34; Clive said. &#34;But a few friends of mine with chronic illnesses are asking if they could come see you. They&#39;ve been pestering me nonstop-I had to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie paused in thought. &#34;I&#39;m really swamped right now But you can go see my mentor. She treats patients at HaloFlow Pharmacy, and honestly, her skills are better than mine. She should be able to help them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive quickly noted the address. &#34;Got it, got it. Thank you,Dr.Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Luxury car turned into a quiet alley near the pharmacy Rylie and Brad stepped out greeted warmly by locals along the way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie, you&#39;re back! I told Selah you were coming -she&#39;s so happy, she&#39;s slaughtering a chicken right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie responded with warmth, greeting familiar faces,while Brad followed, enduring the curious stares with grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered the courtyard, Selah was seated outside, cleaning the chicken. Word of Rylie&#39;s return had traveled fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah stood up, wiping her hands on her apron,her smile warm though a subtle concern lingered in her eyes. &#34;Oh, Rylie... and you brought a guest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad softened his usual military posture and greeted her politely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah took one look at the tall, striking Brad and paused for a beat, clearly recognizing him.&#34;Isn&#39;t this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>s just a guest,&#34; Rylie interjected quickly. joining us for dinner. Nothing more, so don&#39;t overthink it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll prepare a few extra dishes, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to go overboard,&#34; Brad added, &#34;Just a regular meal is fine&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie rolled up her sleeves and turned to him. &#34;You&#39;re the guest-go sit in the backyard living room until dinner&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took the knife from Selah, crouched down, and began preparing the chicken herself. Her movements were practiced and efficient, her blade cutting precisely at each joint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t leave. He leaned against the doorframe,watching with curiosity.&#34;Didn&#39;t think you knew how to do this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Back at the Kirk estate,&#34; Rylie replied without looking up, her voice flat. &#34;This was just part of the daily routine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he heard that, Brad&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
