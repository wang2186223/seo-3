                <p>Right as Paola spotted Rylie, the look on her face stiffened.What she saw wasn&#39;t what she had imagined.Rylie had not arrived in a cheap dress, nor did she look the least bit uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny narrowed his eyes and studied her. &#34;So this is the Owen girl we&#39;ve heard so much about? She&#39;s nothing like the rumors going around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie wore a form-fitting black satin gown that left her shoulders bare. Her hair was neatly pulled up. A vintage necklace rested against her collarbone. The whole look was polished and refined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola forced a smile. &#34;Of course. I&#39;ve always said Rylie and I were similar. We both carry ourselves like ladies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She doesn&#39;t just look refined. She looks like she runs the place.&#34; Intrigued, Johnny commented, &#34;Look at the way she interacts with others; it&#39;s the air of sophistication. It seems she&#39;s learned well to represent the Owen family without embarrassment at this gala.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola clenched her hands at her sides. She replied quickly, though her thoughts were in disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew that she had to keep Johnny&#39;s interest on her. The Reid family had power, especially in maritime trade. Not quite the Morgans,but still valuable. Johnny might make a decent husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saved a seat for you, Rylie. Come sit here.&#34; Paola took slow steps toward her and looped her arm around Rylie&#39;s. Her smile looked apologetic. &#34;Sorry about earlier. I made you late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s eyes were cool. &#34;Even though you and your parents are just a branch of the Owen family,you are still an Owen after all. Showing up on time is the least you could do. Do I need to keep reminding you of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit hard. Paola hadn&#39;t expected to be scolded like that, especially not in front of so many people. Her cheeks flushed, and her voice wavered &#34;I worked late last night. I didn&#39;t mean to hold you up.Nexttime, I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;m not late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her friends couldn&#39;t stay quiet any longer. Isabella stepped forward and said, &#34;Paola was working on music for a director. She&#39;s exhausted. Can&#39;t you cut her some slack? You don&#39;t even work. You spend your days doing nothing but lounging around. Why should you scold her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Rylie&#39;s stare turned sharp. &#34;Since when does an outsider like you have the right to decide whether I can discipline my family members or not?And you say I do nothing all day. Where did that come from? If it didn&#39;t come from gossip, then it came from watching me. Either way, it&#39;s a violation of privacy.Have you been spying on our household? Did you plant devices? Or sneak into our system?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted her gaze and added plainly, &#34;Miss Olson, I think I&#39;ll have the police inspect the entire house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady but left no room for argument.Isabella stepped back, rattled. Her hands moved nervously as she blurted,&#34;How absurd! Why would I bug your house? That&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not that, then how else do you know what I do each day? Or are you simply spreading lies?&#34; Rylie asked without changing her tone. &#34;Seems like manners aren&#39;t something your family passed down very well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie had the final word, and Isabella stood humiliated.Had she chosen to escalate things, the Owen family could have easily crushed the Olsons without lifting a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing that the situation had spiraled out of control,Paola quickly stepped in. &#34;Rylie, please don&#39;t be upset.Isabella meant no harm. She only said those things out of worry for me.&#34; Tears gathered in her eyes as her voice wavered, trying to appear pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re one family, Paola. Have you forgotten that we share each other&#39;s burdens?&#34; Rylie&#39;s lips pulled into a faint smile, though it lacked warmth. &#34;And yet you let your friends shame our name. Do you want people to think the Owen family breeds idleness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of the accusation hit Paola hard. She clenched her fists but couldn&#39;t offer a single rebuttal.Her anger simmered, but all she could do was lower her gaze and mumble, &#34;Fine, Rylie. I&#39;ll remember this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie turned from her and addressed the guests at the table with calm grace. &#34;Please excuse the scene.I hope it hasn&#39;t disrupted your evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure drew silent admiration. Many in the room, who had quietly dismissed her at first, now watched her more carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event was hosted by the Buckleys, known throughout the industry for their jewelry empire. This time, the auction aimed to help children living in poverty-stricken and isolated regions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As things settled down, Celia Buckley stepped onstage.She wore a pale gold gown that shimmered beneath the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rang clear as she greeted the guests.&#34;Thank you for joining us tonight. The Buckley family is honored by your presence at this charity gala.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued with poise after a brief pause,&#34;Tonight&#39;s auction features pieces from our personal collection. Twenty percent of the sales will go toward education and medical needs for children in less fortunate areas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words paused again as she surveyed the room.Her gaze swept across the first floor, then briefly stopped on one of the private viewing boxes above.&#34;Of course, it&#39;s not about the price of a bid. True charity lies in your intent. Whether the amount is high or low, every participant here is helping the children.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Celia delivered her remarks, Isabella, still seething over her earlier embarrassment, noticed something odd. Both Celia and Rylie wore nearly identical necklaces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella studied the necklace around Rylie&#39;s neck, then turned her attention to the stage. Her earlier frustration gave way to sudden delight. &#34;Doesn&#39;t it look like Miss Owen&#39;s necklace is exactly the same as Miss Buckley&#39;s?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to sound curious as she added, &#34;Can anyone help me figure this out? I&#39;d hate to accuse her unfairly and get scolded again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few guests began to murmur. Were the necklaces really that similar? Was Rylie wearing a fake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people seated nearby leaned in, comparing the two necklaces. One by one, their expressions shifted as their focus returned to Rylie</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They match perfectly. What&#39;s going on? Miss Owen,did your brothers only support Paola and not you? ls that why you couldn&#39;t get your hands on the original?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is starting to look bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She lectured Paola earlier like she was some authority.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even Paola had expected things to go this way.Still, the moment worked in her favor. Rylie&#39;s embarrassment gave her the chance to appear composed and kind. She stepped in gently. &#34;Rylie must have made a mnistake. She probably didn&#39;t realize it was a replica. She doesn&#39;t have much knowledge about jewelry. Please don&#39;t be too harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she leaned in close to whisper in Rylie&#39;s ear,&#34;Take it off before too many people notice.Like you said earlier, we can&#39;t let the Owen family lose face.&#34;</p>
