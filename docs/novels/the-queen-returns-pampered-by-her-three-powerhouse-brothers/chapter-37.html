                <p>In her own quiet way, Rylie shied away from flashy displays and the energy of packed rooms. She looked around and admitted, &#34;This isn&#39;t the kind of environment I&#39;m used to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola turned to Kendrick with a soft smile. &#34;Grandpa, maybe I could take her out to find some clothes that suit her and make her feel comfortable. She&#39;ll want to look her best when people come by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among all the families in Kouhron, the Owens stood at the very top. Their reputation depended on their connections, and they never missed a social event. Paola had a practical suggestion, but Kendrick didn&#39;t want his granddaughter to feel uncomfortable or pressured. After a moment of thought, he said,&#34;If you want to pick out something new, I can give you money for it. But you don&#39;t have to change a thing if you&#39;re happy as you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would call Rylie carefree, not now, especially surrounded by relatives that she barely knew. She could see that this world operated by rules that left little room for hoodies and worn jackets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke up, her voice steady. &#34;I do want to get a few new things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Kendrick&#39;s expression brightened. He produced a black card, placing it in her palm with the care of someone handing over something priceless. He said, &#34;I don&#39;t really know what young women like to wear. To be safe, I bought a shopping mall. Everything in there is yours for the choosing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned,Paola stood frozen, watching Kendrick present the card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mall wasn&#39;t just any store- it was the largest in Crolens, worth more than most people could imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola had spent years in the Owen household, sometimes receiving lavish gifts from the family,the sort that drew attention at any gathering. But the thought of gifting an entire shopping center was beyond belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s love for his granddaughter was plain to see, and as Paola watched, she couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of envy and anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the magnitude of the gesture, Rylie tried to refuse. &#34;Grandpa, I have my own money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stil, Kendrick insisted that she take the card. &#34;Let me make up for the years you&#39;ve been lost to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her resistance faded, and she nodded.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola leaned closer and suggested, &#34;If you&#39;re free, we could shop together. I&#39;IF help you pick out some outfits, and there&#39;s a big charity event coming up. It could be a nice way to get to know people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick nod was all Rylie offered. &#34;Sure,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s expression shifted, a glint of something unkind flickering in her eyes. In her mind, no matter how fond the Owens were of Rylie, all that affection would crumble when society caught a glimpse of Rylie&#39;s lack of polish at the upcoming gala.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick clapped his hands together. &#34;Felix&#39;s operation is tomorrow, so let&#39;s all get some sleep,&#34; he said, signaling the end of the gathering. One by one, everyone filtered out of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Military General Hospital would host Felix&#39;s operation, and Rylie arrived at dawn. She had already told Rory that she wanted to watch the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the surgical staff prepared Felix for surgery, he caught sight of Rory and Rylie deep in conversation just outside the operating theater. At first, Felix figured that he was witnessing a classic teacher-student exchange. But as the discussion unfolded,something felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions kept coming from Rory, the hospital&#39;s renowned senior surgeon, but he was directing them at Rylie, instead of offering explanations himself. The medical terminology quickly became complex,leaving Felix behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie, all seriousness, laid out answers with confidence. When she finished, Rory&#39;s face lit up with understanding. &#34;Ah, so that explains the sudden drop in blood pressure for that patient last time,&#34; he said, looking relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give my approach a try if you run into it again,&#34; said Rylie, as if giving advice was second nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix couldn&#39;t hold back his confusion any longer. &#34;Rylie, how come you sound like the real doctor here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His faith in Rory&#39;s expertise wavered. Did the chief surgeon lack even the basic knowledge of a medical student?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled through the medical téam nearby. &#34;No need to worry, Mr. Owen. This sort of éxchange is pretty normal for them. Dr. Carter often goes to Miss Kirk for hélp when he&#39;s stumped,&#34;someone explained, a smile in their voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix could barely process what he was witnessing. Was it not strange for a skilled physician well into his seventies to defer to someone who hadn&#39;t even finished school?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions hung in the air. Rory spoke in a quiet tone. &#34;If we enter from the posterior-lateral angle, do you think that would minimize nerve plexus tension?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes fixed on the scan, Rylie let her fingers drum twice on the glossy film. &#34;That approach is dangerous. The spinal cord&#39;s arterial supply might get damaged. It&#39;s smarter to start from the side control the blood vessels first, then remove the mass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow nod came from Rory as he mulled over the advice, then addressed the anesthesiologist.. &#34;Get the patient ready in the lateral position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s voice trembled with disbelief. &#34;Wait, isn&#39;t the lead surgeon supposed to make calls like this?&#34;The question barely left his lips before the anesthesia took hold, blurring his thoughts and pulling him under.</p>
