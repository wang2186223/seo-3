                <p>Rylie held back a sigh. &#34;I truly am...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an impatient flick of her wrist, the receptionist interjected,&#34;That&#39;s enough out of you. Any more trouble and I&#39;ll get security involved.&#34; Her gaze swept over Rylie dismissively. &#34;If you&#39;re going to fake your way in, at least put some effort into your outfit. Learn how to dress up like a lady from a wealthy family before lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped Rylie. &#34;Wasn&#39;t the Owen family&#39;s daughter missing all these years, though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dismissal sharpened in the receptionist&#39;s reply. &#34;Missing? She&#39;s living in comfort at Serenity Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only ones pretending are women like you, coming from nowhere and playing at being her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several staff passing by joined in the chorus. &#34;Quit holding up the line-just get her out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she listened, Rylie put the pieces together. The receptionist seemed convinced that Paola was the true daughter of the Owens. Paola had been living there for so long, and a lot of people believed that she was an Owen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any irritation slid off her shoulders. Instead, she spoke evenly. &#34;You might want to check with your higher-ups before you force me out. If you make me call myself, things will get much more complicated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doubt flickered in the receptionist&#39;s eyes. She stood torn, weighing whether to pick up the phone,when another voice broke the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amusement played on Fred&#39;s lips as he stepped forward. &#34;So it&#39;s you, Rylie. Banished from the Kirk family, and now you&#39;re pretendingto be the Owens&#39; lost daughter for cash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s mood soured instantly. He snapped, &#34;Rylie! Have you no shame showing up here like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred continued, the mockery thick in his tone, &#34;Mr. Kirk, take a good look at your daughter-throwing away her pride just to chase after a rich family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, he addressed the receptionist with a flourish, his manner suddenly refined. &#34;No need to confirm.You really ought to have security remove scammers like her right away. She will only stain the Owen Company&#39;s name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition dawned on the receptionist, her jaw dropping as she connected the dots. &#34;Wait, I know that face.I&#39;ve seen this woman on the news before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doubt vanished. Instead, a sneer settled on her lips as she addressed Rylie. &#34;Now I remember.You&#39;re the so-called daughter of the Kirk family who got tossed out for your bad reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp jab of Casper&#39;s finger followed, and his words were biting. &#34;Leave, right now! If you mess up my meeting with Mr. Owen, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled from Rylie, unexpectedly bright. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable-how thick-skinned can you get?&#34; Confidence swelled in the receptionist with every supportive glance. She leaned over, pressing the intercom button to summon security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to be intimidated, Rylie pulled out her phone, her tone steady as she spoke. &#34;Deandre, I&#39;m downstairs at the branch. The front desk says I&#39;m a fraud and wants to toss me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre&#39;s frustration spilled out in his answer.&#34;Why is this happening? I left word at the desk that my sister would be dropping by! Don&#39;t move, I&#39;ll send someone down right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk danced across the receptionist&#39;s face. &#34;Keep acting tough. Let&#39;s see what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrill ring sliced through the tension at the desk. Lifting the receiver, the receptionist paled as she listened to the fury pouring through the phone.&#34;What do you mean?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The supervisor on the line shouted, &#34;Have you lost your mind? That&#39;s the Owens&#39; daughter at the door -the one missing for ages! You&#39;re fired! Clean out your desk and leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaken to her core, the receptionist nearly collapsed, her hand trembling so much that she dropped the phone. All she could do was stare at Rylie, who lounged against the counter with an air of effortless composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, mocking smile played on Rylie&#39;s lips. &#34;Surprised? Amazing what one phone call can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred couldn&#39;t help but wonder about the abrupt change, though he had another agenda. Tapping the countertop, he said, &#34;By the way, someone should let Mr. Owen know that Fred is here about the three-hundred-million business partnership we discussed.&#34; By now, the receptionist could barely register Fred&#39;s demand. Panic overtook her as she rushed to Rylie&#39;s side, tears streaking down her cheeks while she bowed low. &#34;Please, I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t realize you were Mr. Owen&#39;s sister-I swear I thought it was Paola! Please don&#39;t let them fire me. I can&#39;t lose this job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compassion rarely extended from Rylie to people who wore cruelty like a badge. &#34;You had every chance to double-check the facts,&#34; she said, voice cool and steady. &#34;But instead, you let arrogance decide for you. People like you end up driving away good clients just because of how someone&#39;s dressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred and Casper stood rooted to the spot, completely thrown off by what was unfolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred tried to get a grip on the situation, his nerves suddenly taut.&#34;What do you mean-sister? Who is Rylie supposed to be related to? Someone explain!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Incoherent with fear, the receptionist could only sink to her knees, grabbing hold of Rylie&#39;s pant leg.&#34;Miss Kirk, I&#39;m begging you-don&#39;t let them dismiss me! I really need this job!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Working the reception desk at the Owen Group&#39;s branch didn&#39;t call for any special qualifications, and it paid handsomely for those who could keep up appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the thought of losing that easy security had her begging at Rylie&#39;s feet, desperate for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone who had jeered at Rylie earlier had disappeared, not daring to breathe too loudly and hoping that she didn&#39;t remember their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a glance down, Rylie offered only a cold warning, saying, &#34;Everyone gets taught lessons by life.What you do with them is your choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security personnel entered next, not to remove Rylie, but to gently pry the receptionist from her grip on Rylie&#39;s clothes. The woman was led away, already facing the reality of a severance check and a quick exit. Rylie didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred and Casper exchanged uneasy glances, their faces drained of color. The evidence before them was hard to ignore - maybe Rylie did have real ties to the Owen family. Still, they struggled to understand how someone they looked down on could possibly share the Owen bloodline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the elevator chimed. An impeccably dressed assistant stepped out, trailed by a half-dozen</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bodyguards in black, each one moving with practiced precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant&#39;s presence immediately caught Fred&#39;s attention; he recognized the man from earlier contract negotiations, always seen at the side of Felix and trusted with all the important paperwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an ingratiating grin, Fred hurried over. &#34;There&#39;s really no need for you to trouble yourself, Mr.Cullen. We could have just gone up to the conference room on our own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair Cullen barely spared him a glance, cutting straight past to stand next to Rylie. He offered a respectful bow. &#34;Miss Owen, I apologize for the way you were treated today. I&#39;ll make sure the reception staff sends you a written apology for your review. Anyone involved in today&#39;s disrespect will be dealt with accordingly, so please set your mind at ease. Also, Mr. Deandre Owen is waiting for you in Mr.Felix Owen&#39;s office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledgment flickered in Rylie&#39;s eyes. &#34;Lead the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across Fred&#39;s face. &#34;Wait!&#34; he called out, unable to process what he was witnessing. He lunged forward,only to have the bodyguards block his path. Desperation colored his voice..Cullen,please-let me through! Just a moment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking command, Alistair guided Rylie to the private elevator reserved for executives. &#34;You&#39;ll find Mr.Deandre Owen on the tenth floor. I&#39;ll have to leave you here, as other matters require my attention.Thank you for understanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reassuring smile from Rylie put him at ease. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it. I can go up by myself.&#34; The doors slid shut behind her, closing off the lobby and its chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lingering by the elevator, Alistair waited until Rylie was out of sight before turning to address Fred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look he gave was frigid. &#34;Mr Dury, perfect timing. Mr. Felix Owen wants a word with you.&#34;</p>
