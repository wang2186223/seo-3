                <p>&#34;Rylie&#39;s just coasting on her brothers&#39; affection,&#34;Percy said, hoping to calm her. &#34;One banquet and she&#39;s already walking off with some stranger.Sooner or later, everyone will see her for who she really is.&#34;He took a seat beside her. &#34;Forget about her. Your focus now should be finishing that composition for Spencer. That international festival isn&#39;t going to wait. Let her dig her own hole. I&#39;ll help you show people who she really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola turned to the pile of blank sheets on her desk.Her fingers tensed around her pen. &#34;You&#39;re right.Rylie can&#39;t match my talent in music, not now,not ever. I can&#39;t afford to waste energy on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie was unaware that she had inadvertently motivated Paola to work through the night with renewed determination writing music. By dawn, with dark circles under her eyes, Paola was ecstatic as she held her completed work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick review, she delivered the finished score directly to Spencer&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That same morning, Rylie had gotten plenty of sleep.After breakfast, she made her way to the community near the military compound, offering free check-ups to the elderly there. As she went from one patient to another, she sensed an odd heaviness in the air.They looked at her with troubled eyes but didn&#39;t speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tried to coax them into talking, but they only gave vague smiles and shook their heads.Most left quietly after taking their prescriptions, leaving her uncertain and curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory was tending to the plants that day. Once he learned that Rylie was around, he stopped by and used the chance to bring up a few medical concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During a short pause, she lowered her voice and asked, &#34;Did something happen? Everyone seems off today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re all on edge,&#34; Rory answered with a sigh.&#34;It&#39;s the drills at sea, the rising tension. War seems closer by the day. And most of their families are serving right at the front. They&#39;re scared, and rightfully so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie frowned, still uneasy. &#34;I get that, but I could tell they wanted to say something more. It wasn&#39;t just fear.What aren&#39;t they telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Rory seemed to know more, Rylie urged,&#34;Tell me directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory looked away, speaking carefully. &#34;Things have been rough these past two years. Military doctors are stretched thin, and some districts have no coverage at all. They&#39;re planning to draft civilian doctors from local hospitals, but the pay is low and the risks are high. Few are willing to go.&#34; He hesitated before adding, &#34;Your name came up. They&#39;re afraid that if the shortage worsens, they&#39;ll ask you to step in. They believe in your skills. They think you&#39;re their best chance if something happens to their boys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded slowly. &#34;So that&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told them not to worry,&#34; Rory added. &#34;With your standing in the Owen famnily, they won&#39;t let you be sent anywhere near danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie held his gaze. &#34;If the time comes, I&#39;ll go. Who l am doesn&#39;t depend on anyone&#39;s name. No one decides for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory gave her shoulder a light pat, his expression softening as another topic came to mind. &#34;That young general from the Morgan family managed to get through the first phase of treatment. Still,everyone knows Nexo-7 doesn&#39;t offer lasting results.He might seem healthy for now, but we both understand the reality. The prognosis isn&#39;t promising.The Morgan family is holding a second-phase seminar soon. A number of medical elites are expected to attend. Will you be there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a slight nod, her eyes narrowing. &#34;I already have a clear understanding of how Brad should be treated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he give you permission to handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Ry/lie answered. &#34;The research project belongs to Timothy, but I&#39;m the one managing the experimental work. Brad agreed to fund the project and provide a lab. I&#39;m in charge of the planning and the treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory blinked in surprise before asking, &#34;Then why the need for a seminar? Isn&#39;t it already settled?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s tone remained even. &#34;Brad and I have our arrangement, but it&#39;s a private one. The Morgan family wasn&#39;t part of that deal. Sean respects Brad,sure, but he&#39;s not going to risk everything on just one voice. They want to collect perspectives and weigh their options. That&#39;s fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory leaned back slightly and added, &#34;Word is, the Wilde family&#39;s aiming to dominate this seminar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a faint smile, though her gaze turned colder. &#34;The Wilde family? Their time in medicine is nearly over.&#34;</p>
