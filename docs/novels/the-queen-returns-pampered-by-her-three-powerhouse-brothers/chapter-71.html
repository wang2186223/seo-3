                <p>Paola felt the weight in her chest tighten, her hands damp with sweat. It felt like she might collapse any second. She prayed the dim lights in the bar would blur the truth. Maybe the camera wouldn&#39;t catch every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the scenes, Ronan moved quickly. He went to fetch footage from tiny pinhole cameras tucked into the corners of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The obvious cameras hadn&#39;t been helpful. Ronan had installed the hidden ones for patrons who liked privacy but still needed protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those discreet lenses had night vision. They recorded high-definition footage that clearly showed Paola pulling Rylie and then throwing herself to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the video played across the large screen, the noise in the room swelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola stood frozen, color drained from her face. Her lips quivered as she tried to keep herself steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, the moment of her pulling Rylie was clear. Even the quick flicker in her eyes betrayed her intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No - this has to be wrong - &#34; she whispered,staggering back a step in her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad moved just in time, catching her arm before she fell. His voice stayed quiet, but something in it struck hard. &#34;Paola, steady yourself. The footage didn&#39;t miss a thing. Even your expression was recorded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy snapped his head toward her. His eyes widened, disbelief splashed across his face. &#34;Paola...did you really...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a performance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wasn&#39;t fragile at all. She planned the whole thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paola really went too far with that trick...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola trembled and suddenly yanked herself out of Brad&#39;s grasp. She raised her hand and pointed furiously at the screen. Her voice cracked as she shouted, &#34;That&#39;s fake! It&#39;s been edited! Rylie... she&#39;s behind it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Brad&#39;s voice cut through the uproar like a blade. Calm,but final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out a handkerchief and wiped his hand where her tears had fallen. His eyes locked on her.&#34;Paola, keep pushing this, and things will only get worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s knees buckled, and she crumpled to the floor. The waves of tears had smeared her makeup,her carefully curled hair now hanging in limp strands across her face. Whatever pity she once stirred had long faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned to Rylie. &#34;Performing pole dances with lewd content might be a bit much. Why not let Percy and Paola admit fault and apologize?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a faint smile. Brad had delivered the stage perfectly. &#34;I suppose I can be generous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy bent down to lift Paola, but she went limp in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether she fainted or faked it didn&#39;t matter to Rylie.She snorted quietly and said, &#34;That&#39;s enough for tonight. I&#39;ve had my fill. Take her to the hospital before something worse happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Percy&#39;s frustration burned beneath the surface, he didn&#39;t saya word. He carried his sister out of the bar, not once looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad signaled for everyone to leave. He didn&#39;t rush,choosing instead to trail behind Rylie at an easy pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning around, Rylie said, &#34;Given your condition, it&#39;s pretty bold of you to show up here tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s tone stayed even. &#34;I didn&#39;t drink. Just came to settle a few things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the subject drop. Once they reached the parking lot, she climbed onto her motorcycle. Before sliding on her helmet, she glanced sideways and said, &#34;Thanks for the help. Don&#39;t be late for your next treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood beside her and asked, &#34;If I hadn&#39;t brought up the footage, were you just going to let this go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a low laugh. &#34;In some way, you kept Paola alive tonight. There are blind spots in this city&#39;s surveillance. Whatever she could do in those places,I could have done far worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warning in her words was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a small laugh. &#34;So I meddled for nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;Not quite. For someone like Paola, who parades herself as noble, public disgrace cuts deeper than any bruise. Her reputation&#39;s done for. And honestly, that&#39;s kind of satisfying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several days passed before the treatment resumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie had temporarily changed the location to the researcch lab on campus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Timothy&#39;s project team now gone, the lab belonged to her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad showed up right on time. As he stepped inside,he saw her absorbed in calibrating the equipment.She didn&#39;t glance his way. Under the cold lab lights,her white coat made her seem distant. Her fingers moved with precision as she worked the controls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just in time,&#34; she said, still facing the monitor.&#34;Lock the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without comment, he reached back and slid the bolt into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made his way to the lab bench, catching sight of a glowing blue vial resting under the lamp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This the new stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned at last, her eyes sharp and bright above her mask. &#34;Yes. This one&#39;s different. It&#39;s a neuro-support compound to prep your nerves for surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She motioned toward a deep container tucked into the corner. &#34;But it&#39;s stronger than Nexo-7. You&#39;ll feel like your whole system&#39;s on fire. That&#39;s why I brought the ice bath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad looked at the cold tub and raised a brow.&#34;Feels like I walked into an Ice Bucket Challenge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s too much for you, skip it,&#34; she said, voice even. &#34;Still, the Nexo-7 won&#39;t hold up much longer.You&#39;ll start seeing the changes when you check the mirror.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t argue, but his face told another story.Each day, he looked more worn, his skin a touch grayer,like something was drained from him slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who understood the body would know he wasn&#39;t fine. Whatever pain he&#39;d been suppressing had come back stronger and showed no signs of easing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad sighed, unbuttoning his shirt. &#34;Looks like I don&#39;t have a choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie turned away and moved toward the machines,letting him handle it on his own. The faint rustle of cloth met her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All set.&#34; Brad voice came from the bath, slightly muffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie glanced over her shoulder. He sat waist-deep in the ice, only his head and shoulders above the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold had already colored his skin, outlining the shape of his muscles beneath the freezing water.</p>
