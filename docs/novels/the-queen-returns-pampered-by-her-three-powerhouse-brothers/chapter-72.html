                <p>Rylie steadied herself, reaching for the syringe that pulsed faintly with a blue glow. Under the lamp, its fine tip glinted like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over to the tub and knelt beside it. Her eyes stayed on the vein that throbbed in Brad&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This will sting,&#34; she said softly, fingers resting gently on his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Brad caught her wrist, halting her. He turned partway to glance at her. &#34;I&#39;m not scared of pain. But the last time you used something this strong,it wrecked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he didn&#39;t wwant to show such vulnerability in front of her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked. The freezing bath, warmed by his body, no longer felt like a barrier. Something between &#34;Then you&#39;d have to brace yourself for this - this one&#39;s worse,&#34; she told him, her voice low. &#34;It targets your nerves. All of them.&#34; Her tone softened slightly.&#34;You have to endure it. I&#39;ll help you as much as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the sharpness she carried melted into something steadier. Her presence carried weight and calm, like someone you trusted without question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With you here, Dr. Owen, I&#39;ve got nothing to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad let her go and turned his head. &#34;Do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The needle broke his skin. His body jerked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie felt his pulse spike under her fingers. The muscles in his neck snapped tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the drug entered his system, his breath turned heavy. Sweat lined his forehead and slid down his jaw, dripping into the bath below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re doing fine. Just hang in there.&#34; Her voice dipped lower without meaning to. She reached up and steadied his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body shivered beneath her hand, trembling as the compound lit up every nerve it touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the last bit of fluid emptied, Brad abruptly lifted his head. His throat flexed, and a soft groan left his lips, low and rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Veins branched out in his eyes like spiderwebs,and he leaned forward without meaning to, dragged by a force he couldn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie leaned in just as he faltered, steadying him before he could fall forward. The warmth of his breath grazed her neck, heavy and sharp with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, she placed her palm against his back and traced slow lines along both sides of his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep breathing. Nice and easy.&#34; Her fingers pressed with practiced care, targeting the places most likely to tense up. Each movement was precise, meant to release pressure, not cause more of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s muscles began to loosen. Even so, his skin burned beneath her touch, standing out against the cold bite of the ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ice surrounding him thinned fast, melting in thick drops under the heat of his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pressed her thumb beneath his shoulder blade, he flinched, letting out a muffled groan before gripping her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie looked up, meeting his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moisture clung to his lashes, and something unreadable flickered behind his usual stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t press there.&#34; His voice had lost its usual edge,rasping with effort. Still, he kept hold of her wrist,as if needing the contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t pull away. Instead, she used her other hand to gently knead the side of his neck.&#34;How about this spot? Is it sore too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a slight shake of his head. A few droplets fell from his lashes and splashed into the water.His breathing eased, yet his grip stayed firm. The ripples in the tub caught the light, dancing across the sharp planes of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you feeling any better?&#34; she asked, the words softer than she intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad lifted his eyes and noticed the slight gap in her coat. Beneath it, the edge of a plain white shirt peeked out. As she leaned forward, the faint line of her collarbone came into view, and for a moment,that was all he could see. What hit him next wasn&#39;t the drug. It was the sight of her. And it burned hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them spoke. Even the sound of melting ice was loud in the silence. Their breaths matched without effort, drawn in unison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;lf | said no,&#34; he murmured, eyes still fixed on her.&#34;Would you keep treating me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, Brad let down his usual aloof facade, his brows furrowed in pain, yet a faint,defiant smile tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Rylie register just how close they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had nearly dropped to her knees in front of the ice bucket, completely surrounded by his presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew her hand away in a rush and accidentally brushed a vial with her elbow. It tipped and shattered beside her, the glass snapping the moment in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice returned to its usual measured calm as she took a step back. &#34;The peak effects have passed.Stay in for ten more minutes, then you&#39;re free to come out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad.didn&#39;t respond. His fingers dug into the tub&#39;s edge, his eyes fixed on the faint pink across her ears.Her composure unsettled him more than it should have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time ten minutes had gone, the improvement was clear.He climbed out of the tub, water falling at his feet in waves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without meaning to, Rylie glanced up, The backlight caught him in full silhouette as he reached for the robe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That view- his shoulders broad, waist tapering in a sharp line - cast a tall shadow beside the bucket.Water traced slow paths down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enjoying the view?&#34; He turned slightly as he spoke,a half-smile tugging at his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie looked away just as quickly, brushing off the moment. &#34;Leave the top open. I need to check the nerves along your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned obediently and tugged the robe down to his waist. The muscles across his shoulders shifted as he moved, catching the light in a way that made it hard to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faint scars ran across his skin. Instead of dulling his appearance,they gave him a rawness that drew the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie studied the results, breathing out in quiet relief.&#34;It&#39;s working. You&#39;Il need monthly injections to keep feeding the nerves until you&#39;re ready for the procedure. With my Al-assisted method, you&#39;ll reach full recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes brightened at the mention of a full recovery. He dressed and thanked her in a raspy voice. &#34;I&#39;ll pay every penny of your fee. If you can really cure me, I&#39;ll agree to any request you make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie raised an eyebrow. &#34;Any request? Even murder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad paused, the corner of his mouth curling with amusement. &#34;From now on, Dr. Owen,your enemies are mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That vow, spoken in his low voice, left no room for doubt. He had chosen his side-and it was hers.</p>
