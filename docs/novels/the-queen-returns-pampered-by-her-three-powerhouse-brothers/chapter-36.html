                <p>&#34;Yes, that country girl. I kept wondering how someone with her background managed to climb so high - now I see you were the one pulling the strings.&#34; Yosef&#39;s lips twisted in contempt. &#34;That Nexo-7formula Rylie handed to Mr. Morgan - don&#39;t bother denying it. You whipped it up from the recipe you stole from the Wilde family, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure that his words sink in, he added, voice oily with threat, &#34;Ms. Wilde&#39;s willing to let this go.Just hand the formula back, and we&#39;ll forget this ever happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice, ice-cold and unmistakably female, broke in from the shadows. &#34;That&#39;s not your call to make.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift motion, Rylie slid off her helmet, her gaze glinting with cold. Her hand shot out, clutching the nearest man&#39;s collar and wrenching him backward. He lost his footing, barely managing a gasp before her knee smashed into his midsection, leaving him writhing in pain on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two more thugs charged, wielding clubs. Rylie pivoted, caught the wrist of the first and twisted hard.Bone cracked, the club clattering to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the second could react, she spun on her heel, knocked his legs out from under him, and forced him to kneel in the dirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her foot pressed down on a fallen stick as she surveyed the group, her tone cold and final.&#34;Anyone tries coming for HaloFlow Pharmacy again, and they&#39;ll be lucky if they can hold a toothbrush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef never saw it coming-a girl who looked fragile and unassuming, laying waste to his hired muscle in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of panic shone in his eyes. &#34;You don&#39;t get it, Rylie. The Wilde family could have every last person at HaloFlow thrown in jail for theft any time they want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sneer curled on Rylie&#39;s lips, saying, &#34;Who ends up in handcuffs hasn&#39;t been decided yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His nerves frayed, Yosef hurled an invitation at her. &#34;Don&#39;t get too full of yourself. The Morgans are holding another seminar for Mr. Brad Morgan. That&#39;s your official invite-from Ms. Wilde. If you&#39;ve got the nerve, show up. We&#39;ll see who gets unmasked as the real thief!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie snatched the invitation midair, her glare like ice. &#34;Tell her I&#39;f be there. And warn the Wilde family to keep their noses clean-they might find trouble they&#39;re not ready for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef let out a laugh, as if she had told the most ridiculous joke. &#34;You think the Wilde family is just a bit of trouble? Let&#39;s get something straight-no one in Crolens dares cross them. The Wildes control everything here, and you&#39;d do well to keep that in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t forget,&#34; Rylie replied, her lips curled in a cool smirk, eyes shadowed with something unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Yosef and his men finally cleared out, the onlookers faded away too, leaving behind only the staff and a few regulars. Several patients approached Selah, who looked shaken and pale, murmuring comfort, &#34;Don&#39;t let them get to you. We know how skilled you are, Dr. Hobbes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A forced smile flickered on Selah&#39;s lips as she instructed the nearby pharmacist to show the last guests out and lock the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie guided Selah gently into a chair. &#34;I never thought the Wilde family&#39;s fakes would stir up trouble here. I&#39;m sorry you had to be dragged into it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah let out a long breath, brushing off the blame. &#34;Don&#39;t apologize. I&#39;ve never gotten along with the Wilde family anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling beside her, Rylie patted Selah&#39;s back in quiet support. &#34;The way they spoke, you sound like you have a past with the Wilde family. You&#39;ve never told me about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Selah&#39;s face as she looked away, refusing to revisit oId wounds. &#34;It&#39;s ancient history.Nothing that needs retelling.&#34; Her eyes flickered to the invitation in Rylie&#39;s hand.&#34;Please don&#39;t go to that meeting. The Wilde family never fights fair-they&#39;ll try anything to hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t pry further, simply waving the invitation with a shrug. &#34;I can handle them. This time, the Wilde family is the one getting wiped out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing how sharp and determined Rylie was, Selah didn&#39;t argue, just reached over to affectionately pat her head. &#34;Freddy mentioned you&#39;ve finally found your real family. Isn&#39;t it time you went home to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie caught the sadness in Selah&#39;s eyes-a loneliness that came from having no children of her own.She gave a mischievous grin. &#34;What are you talking about? HaloFlow is home for me too! Besides,nobody cooks fike you. I&#39;m staying for dinner. Will you make something speciāl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth retumed to Selah&#39;s expression, her smile blooming with affection. &#34;I&#39;H get started right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Selah disappeared into the kitchen to start dinner, Rylie pulled aside one of the pharmacists at HaloFlow. &#34;Can you fill me in on what really happened all those years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s reluctance, he finally opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In those days, both Selah&#39;s and the Wilde family&#39;s names were on the rise in the medical world. Even so, Selah&#39;s family didn&#39;t have the same resources, and she was their brightest star. A bitter disagreement erupted between her and Evita over how to treat a critical patient-Selah pushed for a groundbreaking neural surgery, but the patient died right on the operating table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tragedy hit even harder because the patient&#39;s relatives held serious power, and the fallout destroyed Selah&#39;s family&#39;s prospects overnight. Had it not been for the lives she&#39;d saved before-and someone influential stepping in-Selah would have been behind bars much longer than she really had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s mind worked through the story. She knew how careful Selah was with every case; something about this version didn&#39;t sit right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A major surgical mistake seemed impossible for Selah unless the truth was buried deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the pharmacy, Rylie called Britton straight away, saying, &#34;I need you to dig up every instance of malpractice involving the Wilde family at VitaLink Hospital. Get me hard evidence- I want to make sure the Wildes are taken down for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the gravity in her tone, Britton responded instantly, &#34;You got it, boss. I&#39;ll handle it and get back to you as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once dinner with Selah wrapped up, Rylie made her way back to Serenity Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Paola&#39;s room sparkled with brand new furniture and decorations. Laurel greeted her with a rehearsed smile. &#34;Do you like how I arranged your room, Rylie? If anything&#39;s missing, just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s gaze swept over the room&#39;s over-the-top princess decor. She managed a polite nod. &#34;Thank you for your trouble,Aunt Laurel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick soon appeared at the door. &#34;Rylie, Grandfather wants a word with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering Kendrick&#39;s study, Rylie spotted her two brothers and Paola already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked up to the desk. &#34;Grandfather, you wanted to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick motioned for her to take a seat on the sofa. &#34;Since you&#39;ve come back, I&#39;ve been thinking about throwing a grand banquet in your honor-a chance for friends and dignitaries from all over to meet my cherished granddaughter. Still, Paola mentioned that you might not be comfortable with something so big right away and suggested we hold off for now. How do you feel about it? The decision is completely yours.&#34;</p>
