                <p>Rory froze in surprise, needing a moment to gather his thoughts. &#34;May I ask who you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From among these visitors, a person who looked like a butler stepped forward to explain, &#34;We represent the Owen family of Kouhron. This is our patriarch, MAr.Kendrick Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Rory recognized that name - Kouhron&#39;s influential Owen family had made headlines, and he recalled that Kendrick&#39;s own grandson had only recently arrived in Crolens for a major surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory took a measured breath before responding,&#34;I can&#39;t just hand over someone&#39;s blood sample on a whim. At the very least, you owe me an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler immediately launched into an explanation,his voice low but clear. &#34;Mr. Owen&#39;s granddaughter vanished years ago in Fernridge. We&#39;ve traced possible leads here, and we&#39;re hoping to confirm her  identity through DNA testing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Weighing his options, Rory nodded slowly. &#34;Yes,Rylie&#39;s blood is stored in the hospital bank. Years back, her sister was badly injured in an accident, and her brothers brought her repeatedly to donate. The Kirk family insisted on saving the remaining samples for emergencies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s expression turned thunderous. &#34;They took her blood when she was just a teenager? Who in their right mind would do that to my granddaughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory&#39;s own conscience pricked at him; the Kirk family&#39;s callousness was no secret. Had Rylie not pulled him back from death once, he might never have realized how much she&#39;d suffered. By chance or cruel design, Rylie and Stacey had the same blood type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory turned toward the hallway, gesturing for them to follow. &#34;Let&#39;s get the testing started. If your missing girl truly is Rylie, then she finally has a chance for a new beginning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile on campus, Rylie felt Stacey&#39;s hand clamp down on her wrist. She yanked her arm back,exasperation clear in her voice. &#34;What is it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the half-empty classroom, Stacey&#39;s eyes filled with tears as she hesitated before saying, &#34;Mom and Dad just got back. They&#39;re asking for you at home because...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Stacey could finish speaking, her composure shattered. Tears streamed down her cheeks. &#34;This is all on me, Rylie. I ruined everything. Mom and Dad plan to announce who I really am, and Fred&#39;s set on dumping you to propose to me, but none of this is what I wanted. I swear I never meant to cause you pain!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden breakdown, full of apologies and regret,quickly drew curious stares from everyone in class.Stacey&#39;s loyal friend wasted no time, marching up in outrage. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with you, Rylie? Now that everybody knows you aren&#39;t actually part of the Kirk bloodline, you&#39;re still hanging around and making Stacey suffer as if she&#39;s the outsider?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie fixed her with a cool stare. &#34;What makes you think I&#39;m the one holding on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking herself free from Stacey&#39;s grip, she flicked her sleeve as if brushing away dust. &#34;Honestly, the broken engagement is a relief. I&#39;ll show up as scheduled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey, realizing that Rylie meant every word, tried again, her voice tight with frustration. &#34;But Rylie, if you let Fred go, you&#39;ll be left with nothing. At least if you married into the Dury family, you&#39;d be set for life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, Stacey seemed to be looking out for Rylie, but in reality, she was announcing to everyone that she was the real daughter of the Kirk family and Fred&#39;s future wife!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my gosh, are you really going to marry Mr.Dury?&#34; Stacey&#39;s friend shrieked, eyes wide. &#34;That makes you Crolens&#39; next socialite!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A buzz swept through the classroom. &#34;My father works in real estate,&#34; one classmate chimed in.&#34;He said the Owen family just invested hundreds of millions in a luxury district with the Dury famnily.That&#39;s some serious power!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey basked in the attention, cheeks flushed with pride, but she kept up the act, glancing sideways at Rylie. &#34;Please don&#39;t make a fuss. I&#39;d rather see Rylie happy than go through with this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to Rylie, voice soft. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry.Our brothers want you to teach me to become a real pharmacist. Rylie, can you mentor me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie leaned back against the window, golden sunlight framing her features. &#34;Sorry, but you don&#39;t have the brains for my lessons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey froze, face paling at the blunt reply. &#34;You&#39;re still holding a grudge,&#34; she whispered, voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, she collapsed like a fragile doll,consciousness slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, teachers rushed her to the nurse&#39;s office,and soon after, the school corridors buzzed with gossip - everyone blaming Rylie for making her sister faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie couldn&#39;t have cared less about the rumors.She already had the next period&#39;s biology lesson memorized and decided to ditch class for the music room instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That piano was a relic, used only for student recitals,its keys a little worn but still holding their tune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now and then, Rylie came here to clear her mind.She slipped onto the bench, paused as if searching her memory, then let her fingers drift into an impromptu piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t expect that the usually empty music room would have an unexpected visitor today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Marcus Owen had just returned from an international tour. Upon learning that his younger sister was enrolled here, he&#39;d went straight for the campus, not really expecting to find her right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the courtyard, a melody floated through the air - unfamiliar, yet so powerful it drew him toward a nondescript building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a professional concert pianist, Marcus he had never heard this composition before. The notes were alive, each passage weaving strength with delicacy,the performer&#39;s technique rivaling world-class talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He traced the music to a modest piano room and found a girl seated at the keys, sunlight streaming over her. Despite her simple attire, she looked completely absorbed in the moment, her face radiant with emotion - an image that reminded Marcus of his own rapture at the piano.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Rylie&#39;s hands fell silent and she twisted around, sharply calling out, &#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, catching sight of her and feeling an uncanny connection, blurted the words before he could think;exclaiming,&#34;My sister!&#34;</p>
