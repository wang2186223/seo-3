                <p>&#34;No way!&#34; Percy slammed the table hard, sending his wine glass toppling over. The red liquid splashed across the surface in a messy spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie rose from her seat with unhurried grace,smoothing out the folds in her sleeves. &#34;A bet is a bet. And don&#39;t forget it&#39;s you who proposed this game.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood was drained from his face as the crowd started shouting, &#34;Take it off! Take it off!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched. Without warning, he grabbed a bottle nearby and smashed it on the table. Glass shards flew everywhere as the room recoiled in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough! Shut up!&#34; he yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chanting stopped instantly. Rylie stood her ground, calm as ever. Her eyes didn&#39;t even blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared straight at him, her voice low but firm.&#34;Someone who can&#39;t accept their defeat gracefully doesn&#39;t deserve to be an Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride crumbled. Jaw tight, shoulders hunched, he walked toward the platform. He undid his buttons,one by one, revealing bare skin under the dim lights.Before he could finish, the door to the bar flung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola rushed inside, her white dress flowing behind her.&#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried forward, pulling Percy&#39;s shirt back over his shoulders and shielding him with her own body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing Rylie, she spoke softly. Her voice trembled,though she tried to hold her head high. &#34;Rylie, Percy doesn&#39;t mean any harm. He&#39;s still young. Please don&#39;t hold this against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dipped her head slightly. Her lashes trembled like a hurt child pretending to be brave. Still, she  forced a smile. &#34;He acts without thinking sometimes,but he never means to offend. If he did, then l sincerely apologize. Please don&#39;t make this harder on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for Percy&#39;s hand and clasped it gently.The gesture was tender, like a bird shielding its chick.Her gaze was steady, yet something fragile lingered in her eyes. &#34;If you&#39;re angry,&#34; she said, &#34;then blame me. I didn&#39;t guide him well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd began to murmur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie&#39;s being too harsh. Actually, she&#39;s the one who doesn&#39;t deserve to be an Owen, always so aggressive and impolite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paola&#39;s so gracious. Even stepping in for her brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Percy stood stiff and restless. Watching her defend him only added to his frustration. He leaned in and muttered, &#34;You don&#39;t have to do this,Paola.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of replying, she gave his hand a slight squeeze. It was a silent plea to stay quíet. Her eyes stayed on Rylie, wide and brimming with unspoken words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie let out a soft laugh. &#34;Now I&#39;m a little lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward and looked Paola in the eye.&#34;He invited me here. He set up the game. He said whoever loses will have to admit defeat.&#34; Her gaze sharpened. &#34;So tell me, how exactly did I become the villain in your story, Paola?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t flinch, not even for a second. Paola had counted on her reacting, but nothing came. Her silence left no room for Paola&#39;s bait to land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola bit her lip. In a sudden move, she stepped in and gripped Rylie&#39;s arm. &#34;Don&#39;t take this too seriously,&#34; she said, forcing a smile. &#34;It&#39;s just a game.For the sake of the Owen family&#39;s dignity, think of the bigger picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Rylie was about to pull her arm free, Paola unexpectedly tugged on it, pushing it against herself.The next moment, her delicate face showed a hint of panic as she stumbled backward off the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paola!&#34; shouted Percy, bolting forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pole stage wasn&#39;t high. A few people in the crowd caught her before she could hit the floor hard,so she landed without getting hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat cradling her ankle, her face tight with pain.Tears brimmed in her eyes as she stared at Rylie. Her voice trembled. &#34;You&#39;ve never liked me,but-why did you push me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She winced dramatically, and her act worked.The room stirred with outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie went too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paola was being kind, and she got pushed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder the Kirks threw her out. Even with money, she acts like a street thug. Look how she treats her cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy burned with anger. He pointed at Rylie and shouted, &#34;That&#39;s enough! You&#39;ve gone too far!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices swelled, each louder than the last, but Rylie stood in place. Her face was calm. A faint,unreadable smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped down slowly, stopping in front of Paola.Her eyes lowered, and her voice came out smooth and quiet. &#34;I have to say, Paola, youracting&#39;s not bad at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola froze for a beat, then dipped her head again,her voice even softer. &#34;Rylie, what are you talking about? I don&#39;t understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t bother to answer. She lifted her head and swept her gaze across the room. &#34;This place has security cameras. We can check what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s expression faltered. Her hand twitched as it reached for her skirt, fingers curling into the fabric.She knew this bar well. Percy came here often. The owner made sure no cameras were ever active. Big shots and heirs preferred it that way. There would be no footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought, Paola steadied herself, then smiled again. &#34;If you&#39;d like to check, that&#39;s fine. I just hope that when the truth comes out, you&#39;Il show Percy some understanding. We&#39;ll callit even,yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie watched her carefully. There was a quiet flicker in Paola&#39;s eyes. Paola&#39;s confidence wasn&#39;t coming from innocence. It came from knowing that the cameras had been turned off long ago. Clearly, Paola had come tonight to ruin her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the door on the second floor creaked open. Ronan raised a hand, and the blaring rock music stopped. People paused mid-conversation and turned to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tall figure stepped into view. Brad stood at the top of the stairs, one hand in his pocket, the other flicking a metal lighter open and closed. His voice carried down without effort. &#34;What&#39;s all the noise about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room stilled. Heads turned. Under the dim glow,his sharp features caught the flickering flame, and for a moment, no one spoke.</p>
