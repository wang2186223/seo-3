                <p>Without uttering a single word, Rylie settled herself inside Brad&#39;s car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crolens&#39; legendary winding mountain road, home to the World Racing Knockout Tournament, was notorious for its steep descent and endless hairpin curves-features that made the race daunting for even seasoned drivers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up above, a helicopter hovered, its blades slicing through a gentle drizzle as it made its way around the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad broke the silence, his tone even. &#34;From what I&#39;ve heard, this course hasn&#39;t seen a race in five years. Extreme elevation shifts put both drivers and their machines to the test. They also say the fatality rate is no joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stretched out in the seat, unfazed. &#34;I&#39;m impressed you&#39;re so well-versed in this track&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned, his eyes searching. &#34;Feeling prepared? I haven&#39;t spotted your name in any major races before. Is this your championship debut?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ghost of a smile flickered on Rylie&#39;s lips, her eyes shining with quiet determination. &#34;Officially, yes.But if we&#39;re talking experience, there isn&#39;t a soul here who can outdrive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one who watched her could dismiss the authority she carried, despite her youth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rain had stopped at the foot of the mountain by the time the helicopter touched down. Already, the area buzzed with racers and eager onlookers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jumping from the helicopter, Rylie started to thank Brad, only to catch a shadow of emotion crossing his face as he lingered in the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze drifted skyward, and with a sudden motion, she dug out a candy from her bag, tore off the wrapper, and signaled from the edge of the aircraft. &#34;Come here. Bend down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad paused, weighing her request, then ducked down from the helicopter, curiosity clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was steady. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie pressed the candy gently to Brad&#39;s lips, her fingertip leaving a fleeting touch that unsettled him in ways that he couldn&#39;t explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock, the vigilant soldier assigned to Brad&#39;s security, sprang forward. &#34;Sir! You really shouldn&#39;t accept food from anyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the protest, Rylie parted Brad&#39;s lips with practiced confidence and slipped the candy inside.Moisture from her fingers lingered briefly before she wiped her hand on her pants. &#34;I made it myself.The medicine&#39;s aftereffects might still linger, especially with the altitude changes. This should help you adjust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,a cool burst of mint spread through Brad&#39;s mouth, soothing the pressure in his chest almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waved his hand to indicate to Brock that he was fine, his expression softening slightly.&#34;|tdoes help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick grin flashed across Rylie&#39;s face.&#34;Time for me to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she disappeared into the crowd, Brad&#39;s hand drifted to his mouth, and a quiet chuckle escaped him.&#34;Fascinating woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subtle shifts in Brad&#39;s mood never escaped Rylie&#39;s attention, and she picked up on it instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the moment, Brock interjected, &#34;General, the meeting&#39;s about to begin. Colonel&#39;s wondering why you aren&#39;t logged in yet. They&#39;re still waiting on your verdict about the Emerald Sea oil field.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a slow breath, Brad reclined in his seat. &#34;Push it to midnight. Book a VIP suite overlooking the track-I&#39;ll watch the race from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered in Brock&#39;s eyes, and he blurted,e you planning to stay for Miss Kirk and take her home when she&#39;s done?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A coolglance from Brad met his question. &#34;Is there a rule against it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock kept his thoughts to himself, though he couldn&#39;t help but feel that his commander&#39;s interest in that remarkable doctor was becoming more obvious-even at the expense of a high-stakes meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>International waters near the Emerald Sea had recently yielded new oil reserves, and rival nations were already dispatching reconnaissance ships, raising tensions all around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad seemed to read Brock&#39;s mind and simply remarked, &#34;They can handle decisions on their own sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy feeling dropped in Brock&#39;s stomach. &#34;Then may you break every record, General-even for the next ten thousand years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the registration desk, Rylie caught sight of countless Phillip supporters in the stands, their banners waving proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s admirers were there as well; despite being one of the youngest racers, she charmed the crowds and always drew the spotlight with her polished appearance at every ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie glanced around coldly, already anticipating how Stacey might mess things up and how Phillip would face the fans&#39; wrath after a crushing defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting at the entrance, Britton spotted her and quickly flagged down the officials. &#34;She&#39;s here! Our last team member has arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the registration area, members of Phillip&#39;s crew noticed Rylie too, shouting for Nicolas, &#34;Look!Rylie actually made it! We thought she&#39;d bail!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For hours, Phillip&#39;s calls to Rylie had all gone unanswered, his temper rising with each attempt. Her appearance at the track now had him scoffing in triumph. &#34;Of course she came. There was no way she&#39;d miss the race.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned toward Stacey, lowering his voice. &#34;Since she&#39;s finally shown up, we stick to our usual plan.You&#39;ll run the anchor leg, Stacey. Rylie can handle the other segments.&#34;</p>
