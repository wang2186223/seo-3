                <p>With Selah&#39;s fierce resolve, the Dury family was thrown out completely - along with several large boxes of proposal gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie looked them in the eye and warned, &#34;Don&#39;t come near me again. If you do, I won&#39;t hold back next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Dury family finally gathered their things and left in silence.Their departure didn&#39;t go unnoticed-several neighbors witnessed the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie Clayton, who always loved a spectacle, stood at the door snacking and remarked, &#34;Those gifts add up to a few million. Rylie, why won&#39;t you agree to such a good family? If you marry into them, you won&#39;t have to struggle keeping that little pharmacy afloat. You&#39;d be living the good life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie paused at the door before closing it and said calmly, &#34;A man who can&#39;t be faithful won&#39;t bring happiness, no matter how rich he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie scoffed, &#34;Marriage is just about daily life. As long as there&#39;s money, what&#39;s the big deal? All men stray.Just turn a blind eye. Everyone knows you were kicked out of the Kirk family, and your engagement was broken off. Life can&#39;t be easy now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not everyone knew Rylie had become the granddaughter of a powerful business magnate -news didn&#39;t spread as fast outside the elite circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rylie could reply, Selah came out, her expression sharp. &#34;Money isn&#39;t everything. True happiness comes from love and respect. If he truly loves and protects her, that&#39;s all that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie couldn&#39;t stand women who gossiped and dragged others down. She cut in suddenly, saying,&#34;Didn&#39;t your daughter marry into a family that moved here from another city? New money, right? How&#39;s that going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, another neighbor, Leona Ruiz, strolled by with a basket of vegetables and chimed in, &#34;She came back the other day asking for money. That so-called rich husband has a mistress, and rumor says she&#39;s pregnant with a son. He&#39;s showering her with gifts too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie&#39;s face darkened at once. &#34;What nonsense are you spouting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leona didn&#39;t back down. &#34;You don&#39;t want people talking about you, but you&#39;re quick to badmouth Rylie just because HaloFlow Pharmacy charges a little more for your medicine? Those same medicines cost twice as much at big chain stores. HaloFlow raised prices just a bit, and you start spreading rumors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie&#39;s face flushed with anger. &#34;I didn&#39;t start any rumors! It&#39;s all in the news-plain as day. Rylie&#39;s an abandoned woman with a broken engagement.In our village, that&#39;s unwanted. The Dury family wants to marry her, and I&#39;m just looking out for her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leona snapped back, &#34;Save it! Rylie already has a boyfriend-handsome,too,with that upright military vibe. Did you see that luxury car parked near the alley?My son said it&#39;s a global limited edition worth nearly ten millions. The Dury family&#39;s gifts can&#39;t compare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie blinked.Boyfriend? What boyfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah, on the other hand, seemed to catch on. Her eyes lit up as she took Rylie&#39;s hand. &#34;Oh, it&#39;s him?That&#39;s great. I&#39;ve always thought he was a good kid. A little thin maybe, but steady and kind. And he&#39;s good -looking,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leona nodded excitedly. &#34;Exactly! He&#39;s worlds ahead of Evie&#39;s flashy son-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie, clearly irritated by the comparison, muttered,&#34;I&#39;ve never seen this so-called boyfriend. Does he only visit at night? That&#39;s suspicious. What if he already has a family or a girlfriend? I&#39;m just saying-I don&#39;t want Rylie to get hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah hesitated and looked at Rylie with concern.&#34;He&#39;s probably in his thirties. Have you asked him carefully?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie sighed, a little overwhelmed. &#34;This is ridiculous He&#39;s not my boyfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evie jumped on that. &#34;Then why do you always meet him at night? Are you two hiding something? Rylie,you can&#39;t be doing things you&#39;ll regret!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leona added with a playful smile, &#34;Why not just ask him? We&#39;ve got nothing to hide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah now looked even more unsure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Rylie was irritated by the gossip, Selah&#39;s worried expression made her give in. She pulled out her phone and sent a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you free? Selah thinks you&#39;re my boyfriend. Can you help me clear it up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, he replied almost instantly. &#34;I&#39;m free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he was up for it, Rylie turned to Selah. &#34;I&#39;ll call him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped the video call icon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments Later, the screen lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad appeared in a dark suit, seated in a leather chair,his expression calm and eyes sharp. Behind him was a wide screen and a massive floor-to-ceiling window showing the landmarks of a bustling financial district.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie raised an eyebrow.&#34;Are you in a meeting? I can call back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad set his pen down and answered gently, &#34;No need.It&#39;s just wrapping up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, his team sat frozen. Wrapping up?What was wrapping up? Just a moment ago, Brad had been scolding them over internal issues at Morgan Group. Layoffs were looming. Now, one video call later, their strict boss had transformed into a charming gentleman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever was on the call had clearly saved them.Before this call, they were unsure if they would be the next ones to be dealt with by Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad glanced around the long table. That was enough</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several department heads quietly began packing up,sneaking glances at the screen. Some whispered,wondering who could soften Brad&#39;s gaze like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No bother at all-my team just stepped out,&#34; Brad said calmly. From the cracked door, a few team members could still hear his warm baritone drifting out. One even joked that it had to be Brad&#39;s twin in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock. who knew better than anyone, smiled faintly &#39;That&#39;s what love does to him.&#34;</p>
