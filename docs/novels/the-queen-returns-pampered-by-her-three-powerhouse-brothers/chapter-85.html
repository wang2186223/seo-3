                <p>When Laurel stepped into the room, she found Paola in pieces. Her daughter was sobbing so hard that she could barely breathe. Paola had never stumbled like this before. Life had always unfolded in her favor. But with Rylie around for only a few days, everything had unraveled. Her world was already coming apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel wrapped an arm around her trembling shoulders and whispered, her voice heavy with fury, &#34;I never imagined that girl could dig so deep without us noticing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, Paola struggled to speak. &#34;Marcus wants to send us back to the Garretts. What are we going to do,Mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel scowled. &#34;You brought this on yourself. How many times have I told you? If it&#39;s something money can fix, you don&#39;t do it with your own hands. And yet you went into her room and took her things.&#34; Her voice hardened. &#34;Did I raise a fool? What happened to everything I taught you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola flinched at the scolding. Her tears wouldn&#39;t stop.&#34;It&#39;s over. She&#39;s going to release that video. I know she will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel scoffed, &#34;Even if she keeps it to herself, do you really think no one will catch on? You passed someone else&#39;s work off as your own.&#34; She glared. &#34;Those women were never your friends. They flattered you because of your connection to the Owen family. Now that something&#39;s wrong, they&#39;ll tear you apart without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m finished,&#34; Paola whispered, barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel straightened her spine. &#34;Don&#39;t you collapse on me. I won&#39;t let you drag yourself into the mud. We are not leaving this family, not until you marry someone with power. I&#39;ll handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in hours, Paola saw something other than despair. &#34;Then what do l do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Rylie returned to the Owens&#39; estate. Just as she sat at the table, a servant rushed in, his face pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something serious has happened! Miss Garrett cut her wrists. It was a suicide attempt!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze. No one touched their food. Kendrick was the first to break the silence. &#34;What made her do something so extreme?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus hadn&#39;t spoken about it earlier, but with the news now out, he had no choice. &#34;This has nothing to do with Rylie. Paola brought it on herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s eyes darkened. He dropped his utensils with a heavy clatter. &#34;Unbelievable. All that over a stolen piece of music? That&#39;s shameful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife leaned forward, her brow creased. &#34;Did she survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s in the hospital,&#34; said the servant. &#34;Still in danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lowered her head slightly. Her fingers tapped the table as she said quietly,&#34;She went too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus looked at her steadily. &#34;What do you intend to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a faint nod. &#34;Since this all started with me, I&#39;ll go see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she rose and turned to Kendrick. &#34;Grandfather, leave this to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick gave it a moment&#39;s thouight before offering a nod. &#34;Handle it properly. Don&#39;t give outsiders a reason to sneer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Rylie stepped into the room and found every Garrett already present. Laurel sat close to Paola, her eyes red and swollen from crying. The second they noticed someone at the door, the air shifted.Even Laurel&#39;s sobs fell silent for a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Kendrick would bring more of the Owens to the hospital due to the family ties.It had never crossed her mind that Rylie would be the only one sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel clenched her fists, but the real objective tonight was Rylie. Whether the rest came or not didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel stood up and faced her. &#34;Rylie, this happened because I failed to raise my daughter right. I&#39;m sorry for the trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola stirred on the bed. Her face looked pale, and her bandaged wrist left streaks of red across the blanket. Moving slowly, she slipped off the bed and lowered herself onto her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wrong, Rylie. I really am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave her a cold look. &#34;Wrong about what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola swallowed her sobs. Her voice trembled. &#34;I had no right to use your composition. I won&#39;t ask you to forgive me. Just please don&#39;t drag my family into this. They didn&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie replied evenly, &#34;I never intended to go after your family. I&#39;ve already talked to Spencer.He knows you inspired the piece, and we&#39;re both listed as composers. Your reputation is safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Percy burst into the room. His face was dripping with sweat, and his gym clothes clung to him. He must&#39;ve run straight from training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped when he saw Paola kneeling, her arm bandaged in red-soaked gauze. Rylie stood in front of her,calm and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed forward in a fury and pulled Paola into his arms. &#34;Rylie! What more do you want-her dead?&#34; His shout echoed through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel quickly stepped in and grabbed his arm, crying out, &#34;Stop it, Percy. Rylie&#39;s not the one who hurt Paola. She brought this on herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy scowled, his voice laced with venom. &#34;Since you came back, it&#39;s been nothing but disaster.If my sister dies because of you, I swear l&#39;Il make you pay for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t blink. Her gaze stayed steady on him. &#34;Why are you talking as ifI bullied her? Isn&#39;t it she who broke into my room? Isn&#39;t it she who tooka private piece of music and claimed it for herself? And now she is playing the victim by committing suicide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shifted to Paola, who still sat slumped on the floor. &#34;Your poor acting might fool others, buta medical student. That bandage is tied wrong. And the blood on it? It&#39;s from blood plasma, not your bleeding,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s face turned pale. &#34;What nonsense are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie pulled out a chair and took a seat. Her expression lost all softness. &#34;That concert was a warning. You live off the main Owen family. You&#39;d do well to remember your place. If not, I&#39;ll step in for Grandfather myself -and I won&#39;t be as gentle next time.&#34;</p>
