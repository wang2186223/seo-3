                <p>Celia had grown up surrounded by jewelry. She understood, deep down, that Rylie hadn&#39;t been wrong The necklace that she wore was a fake.Her family had trusted international auctions without question and never imagined that it might be a counterfeit. For years, they kept it locked in their safe, believing it to be a treasured heirloom. Wearing it for the first time tonight had made her look foolish. Still, she had a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia steadied her voice and said, &#34;There&#39;s no need for more discussion. Miss Owen, thank you for telling me the truth. I need to go to the toilet now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she turned, Rylie spoke up, calm and composed.&#34;This replica may lack history, but the craftsmanship is still impressive. Even without the legacy, it&#39;s a fine piece to keep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia slowed, looked back, and gave a nod. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Celia walked away, the table fell into silence.Isabella, who earlier had hoped that Rylie would be humiliated,now sat staring at her lap, her face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny raised his glass toward Rylie. &#34;Miss Owen, I didn&#39;t expect you to know so much about jewelry. You clearly live up to the Owen name. Here&#39;s to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie touched her glass to his and answered with grace,&#34;I only know a little. Forgive me if I came across as boastful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola was awkwardly silent, unsure of what to say.Finally,she forced a smile and teased, &#34;It&#39;s so lucky to always receive gifts. Rylie, your brothers gave you this set of jewelry, right? And you actually didn&#39;t tell me.I nearly embarrassed myself tonight because of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had seen how Paola insisted earlier that Rylie apologize. Now, the truth had flipped the situation on its head. She looked unprepared and unaware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s tone remained light. &#34;No one gave it to me.&#34;She met Paola&#39;s eyes and added, &#34;We shouldn&#39;t always wait for others to gift us things. Buying what we want on our own is perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile slid off Paola&#39;s face. Her hands balled tightly in her lap. She hadn&#39;t expected Rylie to say it out loud-to hint that she relied on the family while Rylie stood independent. It was a blatant jab at her-suggesting that she was merely a dependent relyìng on the Owen family for appearances, while Rylie was the true, capable Owen daughter who stood on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests seated nearby began trading glances, their smiles barely contained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Miss Garrett makes a habit of asking for presents   1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder she went after Miss Owen earlier. Sounds like envy to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep flush crept over Paola&#39;s ears as her smile stiffened. Her voice trembled as she tried to recover.&#34;Rylie, surely you&#39;re teasing. I only said so because think everyone in the Owen family loves you and that it&#39;s not surprise if they give you precious gifts-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Rylie swirled her wine glass with ease,her eyes playful but alert. &#34;Then that&#39;s fine. But next, do remember to figure out what is really going on before jumping to conclusions.&#34; She paused. Her tone softened, though her words landed sharp. &#34;That way,you won&#39;t humiliate yourself again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remark landed like a slap that Paola never saw coming. She lurched to her feet, the chair scraping across the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I need to freshen up.&#34; Her voice cracked as she rushed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella stood up quickly and called after her, &#34;Paola,wait! I&#39;ll come too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their flustered exit left behind scattered giggles and stifled murmurs among the guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman in a silver dress leaned forward and said pointedly, &#34;Miss Owen, I admire how you expose people&#39;s true colors with such few words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie offered a quiet smile, sipping her champagne as her gaze lifted toward the balcony above. Brad stood by the railing, watching from a distance. His eyes held hers. He raised his glass, the hint of a smirk playing on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tilted her head in acknowledgment, returning the Look with a faint, knowing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the room settled, the auction began in earnest.Item after item dazzled the crowd as the auctioneer&#39;s voice rang out, driving the bids higher and higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie leaned back in her chair, barely interested. These pieces, though lovely, were nothing compared to what she already owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stifled a yawn, her gaze drifting lazily across the hall. A flicker of movement caught her attention. A server stood nearby-too still,too stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something felt wrong. A properly trained waiter wouldn&#39;t hold that posture. And his hand wasn&#39;t resting naturally under the tray. It was held firm, as though gripping something hidden. What kind of threat would even warrant a body like that here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie blinked once, and her casual air faded. Her back straightened. She scanned the crowd again, her eyes pausing on the second-floor balcony. The moment she saw the box, her expression changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That man wasn&#39;t here for just anyone. He was after Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the guests remained absorbed in the auction,Rylie rose to her feet. Johnny looked over and called out, &#34;Miss Owen, the Buckley collections are coming up.Don&#39;t you want to see them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered with a simple, &#34;Restroom break.&#34;Without hurry, she made her way toward the spiral staircase.Once she passed the last row of tables, her pace quickened. Her hand lifted the edge of her skirt just enough to move freely, heels clacking sharply across the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second level was hushed. Not a single voice drifted from the boxes. Rylie kept close to the wall until she caught a faint metallic sound just ahead. Her steps stopped. She turned the handle and pushed open the door without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Brad reclined on a sofa, casually twirling a cup between his fingers. He glanced up at the sudden entry.&#34;Over already? I thought that show would last longer,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie slammed the door shut behind her and strode across the room. One hand grabbed his tie, yanking him downward. &#34;There&#39;s an assassin.&#34;</p>
