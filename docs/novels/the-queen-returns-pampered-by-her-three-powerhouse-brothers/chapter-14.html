                <p>&#34;Yes, that&#39;s correct.&#34; Brad inclined his head slightly,revealing a perfectly sculpted profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for your assistance, but thanks anyway,&#34;Rylie replied casually, eyeing Brad and mistakenly assuming that he had arrived for medical advice.&#34;You&#39;re looking healthier, though you should keep taking your medications for now. Unfortunately,your current condition is too serious for any immediate procedures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Rylie&#39;s assessment medication alone wouldn&#39;t suffice to cure Brad; he&#39;d need delicate nerve repair surgery, a specialty she hadn&#39;t fully mastered yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared deeply into her eyes and said evenly,&#34;I&#39;m not here because of you. I&#39;m meeting Timothy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wry smile curved Rylie&#39;s lips. &#34;What a small world.He used to be my mentor,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A fortunate coincidence,&#34; Brad remarked dryly,extending a folded campus newspaper toward her.&#34;You&#39;re the student he expelled, and this project happens to be my investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad hadn&#39;t deliberately sought her out-it truly was coincidental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Skimming the newspaper briefly, Rylie chuckled lightly. &#34;Just a heads-up, Timothy can&#39;t fulfill your expectations. But feel free to continue funding him if you like wasting money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timothy&#39;s team was exploring cutting-edge medical and artificial intelligence technologies, but all their foundational research depended entirely on Rylie&#39;s contributions. Without her, the project was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad met Rylie&#39;s eyes steadily, seeing the amused skepticism within. He could tell that she spoke the truth; her composure during his intense pain had proven her resilience and talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This research holds the key to my surgery,&#34; Brad explained earnestly. &#34;My career cannot be compromised by medical limitations. I&#39;m certainyou grasp the gravity of that, Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling her dark, confined sessions treating Brad,Rylie vividly remembered the countless scars marking his skin - battle injuries from dedicated service to their nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Brad&#39;s condition was neurological, and a single error during surgery without advanced medical techniques could render him permanently paralyzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Brad, who had given everything for his country, Rylie felt genuine admiration stirring. After a thoughtful pause, she asked earnestly, &#34;Are you willing to trust me with your life&#39;s most critical research?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad calmly asked, &#34;Do I have any reason not to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His penetrating gaze remained fixed on her. &#34;There&#39;s nothing left for me to fear losing, so why not risk one last gamble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly narrowing her eyes in approval, Rylie handed Brad her phone. &#34;As expected of a high-ranking naval officer.Please leave a contact, Mr. Morgan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s fingers brushed lightly against hers as he accepted the device, the brief touch carrying unexpected warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;VitaLink Hospital produced a vial of Nexo-7; I intend to collect it,&#34; Brad said quietly, handing the phone back slowly, fingers grazing again. &#34;But I&#39;ve heard recent troubling reports about VitaLink. I&#39;m no medical expert - could you accompany me,Miss Kirk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad had grown suspicious of VitaLink Hospital after discovering the Wilde family&#39;s blacklisting through dark web channels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conveniently free at the moment, Rylie dismissed Rory, entered the vehicle on the opposite side, and settled comfortably inside. &#34;Let&#39;s go. I&#39;ll join you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the luxurious car, Brad&#39;s heavy medicinal scent lingered initially, replaced by Rylie&#39;s subtle fragrance of lilies that gently eased his usual tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car exited campus smoothly, passing a visibly distressed Vivian rushing along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey sat fuming in a campus cafe, with Leland attempting to comfort her by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fragile composure shattered abruptly when her phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian urgently questioned her absence. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you at the lab? Grab the Nexo-7 immediately-we need to get to VitaLink Hospital, now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s pulse quickened, her voice trembling as she responded, &#34;Dr. Estrada, we&#39;ve just completed the Nexo-7. I&#39;d prefer to monitor its results a bit more.What&#39;s the urgency?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian&#39;s brow knitted together in frustration. &#34;You sent me a photo two days ago confirming the Nexo-7was ready. I verified it personally- it matches your former colleague&#39;s formulation perfectly. Stop worrying about its potency. Just get it to VitaLink Hospital immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivian said sternly, &#34;Protect that vial of Nexo-7carefully - it&#39;s very valuable and crucial to your future! Your entire career hangs on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After she ended the call, Stacey&#39;s complexion was drained of color. Noticing her panic, Leland questioned softly, &#34;What&#39;s got you so anxious?Vivian wants the Nexo-7; just bring it to her.Relax.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shaky fingers, Stacey nervously replied,&#34;Leland, is the solution truly so valuable? I had no idea it was so valuable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey was overwhelmed by regret. She never imagined that the formula Rylie had efortlessly created could be so precious. Back then, determined to outdo Rylie in everything, she let her pride override reason, thinking that she could definitely produce what that idiot Rylie could make, and rashly promised Vivian that she could produce the Nexo-7.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite locking herself away in the lab, Stacey had failed miserably, exhausting all the materials that Vivian provided without creating the Nexo-7. Now all she had was a questionable half-finished substance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had confidently informed Leland about her progress, even sending him photographic proof of a seemingly high-quality compound that she had created during long, sleepless nights in the lab.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland reassured her gently, saying, &#34;You&#39;ve done impressive work. The purity level looks excellent. It&#39;ll be fine, Stacey-I believe in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Stacey was trapped by her own deception, and her anxiety intensified until her hands trembled uncontrollably. Admitting that she had never created the Nexo-7 would mean surrendering her dignity and admitting inferiority to Rylie. How would she face Leland and Vivian afterward? What choice did she have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing abruptly, Stacey hurried toward the lab,desperately searching for an escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, inspiration struck her. Nobody knew exactly what high-purity Nexo-7 should look like -she could simply alter the color and present it as authentic. If questioned later, she could blame the treatment&#39;s failure on the patient&#39;s severity rather than her formula.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded Stacey&#39;s tense frame. Confident in her new plan, she collected the fake compound and hurriedly left for VitaLink Hospital with Leland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, what Stacey hadn&#39;t anticipated was encountering Rylie at VitaLink Hospital, comfortably conversing among senior hospital directors and doctors.</p>
