                <p>The message couldn&#39;t have been more obvious. Paola had no intention of stepping in, and she certainly wouldn&#39;t risk crossing Deandre for someone like Fiona,no matter her fame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration welled up inside Fiona as she ended the call, her fists clenching at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of giving up, she chose to remain seated on the plush sofa outside the CEO&#39;s office, determined not to leave just yet. Soon, she spotted a group of receptionists approaching, each one carrying plates piled high with gorgeous, pricey pastries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hopeful spark appeared in Fiona&#39;s eyes. &#34;Are those for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A receptionist offered her a polite smile. &#34;They&#39;re for Miss Owen. Mr. Owen was worried she might have skipped lunch to come here, so he had us put together a little spread.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Owen?&#34; The name left Fiona momentarily frozen, memories of Paola&#39;s earlier complaints tumbling back into her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That conversation had been about the long-lost Owen daughter, newly returned and settling in at Serenity Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned - could it be the eccentric woman she&#39;d glimpsed earlier? That unusual young woman was actually the missing Owen daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched the receptionists disappear inside with their plates, Fiona&#39;s thoughts twisted into knots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the office door swung open and Rylie emerged.Fiona sprang to her feet, offering a strained,apologetic grin as she moved to block Rylie&#39;s way. &#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Miss Owen. I didn&#39;t realize who you were earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie immediately recognized Fiona from the silver screen- after all, Fiona was a well-known actress,the very star who&#39;d been cast in Spencer&#39;s upcoming movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a curious overlap, since Paola happened to be composing for the film, which was still in its early development stages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie paused a moment, then stepped forward and offered her hand. &#34;I&#39;m Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona quickly grasped Rylie&#39;s hand, introduced herself with practiced poise, and asked, &#34;Do you know if  Deandre is available?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got ten minutes,&#34; said Rylie, her tone polite but brisk. &#34;He has a meeting after that, so you can catch him now if you hurry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That answer left Fiona blinking in surprise. &#34;He actually agreed to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, knowing smile, Rylie explained, &#34;I let him know you&#39;d been waiting a long time out here, hoping for a chance to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>in a flash, Fiona&#39;s whole demeanor changed. &#34;Rylie,let&#39;s exchange contact information! If you ever want to go to a concert or a movie premiere, just tell me -I&#39;ll get you tickets,front row!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem,&#34; Rylie said, passing along her contact info before heading on her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought never would have crossed Fiona&#39;s mind that someone as steadfast as Deandre - who wouldn&#39;t even listen to Paola-would so easily bend for Rylie. Clearly, this newly returned daughter held real influence within the Owen family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, in Deandre&#39;s office, Rylie had first asked if she might join his advanced medical research project.Thinking that she was simply curious, Deandre agreed to let her visit the lab once the group formed and funds were secured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Rylie brought up Fiona&#39;s situation, and Deandre&#39;s demeanor soured. &#34;We met abroad, spent a month together, nothing more. I even gave her a generous parting gift. I can&#39;t understand why she keeps turning up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, Rylie replied, &#34;She mistook me for your girlfriend when I arrived, and she looked genuinely upset. Money doesn&#39;t fix feelings, Deandre. Why not meet with her, explain things clearly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his sister&#39;s words gave Deandre pause.For a moment, he remembered how Fred ended things with Rylie, only to announce a new engagement immediately after. Was she projecting her own hurt onto Fiona&#39;s heartbreak?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see her,&#34; Deandre answered without hesitation.&#34;Don&#39;t worry-I&#39;m nothing like Fred.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile played on Rylie&#39;s lips. &#34;I know you&#39;re not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the branch office behind, Rylie steered her car toward Vantage Mall, the city&#39;s premier shopping destination. In her pocket, she carried the exclusive blank card that opened every door in the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, Paola had extended an invitation to browse for refined, elegant clothes together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at the cafe nestled within the mall, Rylie quickly spotted Paola holding court among a cluster of other well-dressed young women from wealthy families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola was quick to catch sight of her, rising from her seat with a wave. &#34;Rylie! You made it-come join us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, every eye in the group turned to Rylie,and a wave of murmured gossip swept through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So that&#39;s the Owen family&#39;s lost daughter? She doesn&#39;t hold a candle to you, Paola.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, look at those bargain-bin brands she&#39;s wearing.What was she thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No surprise there. The Kirk family clearly didn&#39;t teach her the first thing about style. She just doesn&#39;t belong in this crowd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola interjected,pretending to protect Rylie from the barbs, &#34;Let&#39;s not judge. Rylie&#39;s simply down-to-earth,not one to stress over labels. She&#39;s actually wonderful company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter rippled through the group, their glances heavy with dismissal</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking up to Paola, Rylie quietly remarked,&#34;thought it would be just us on this shopping trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be upset, Rylie. Everyone was eager to meet you and become friends. When word got out about our shopping trip, they were determined to tag along,&#34;Paola said softly,looping her arm through Rylie&#39;s.&#34;Try not to take it to heart. They&#39;re just being friendly-and you might find their advice helpful when it comes to picking the perfect look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie picked up on the insincerity hiding behind their smiles; to her, it was clear that these women came more for entertainment than friendship. Still,she kept her thoughts to herself and gave Paola a polite nod.&#34;If you say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what are we standing around for?&#34; one of the women sneered, glancing at the others with a sly spark in her eyes. &#34;Let&#39;s help Miss Owen find something stunning for the charity gala!&#34;</p>
