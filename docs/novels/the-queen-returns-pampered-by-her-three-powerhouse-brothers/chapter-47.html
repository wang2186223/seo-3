                <p>Rylie shifted her eyes to Tessa&#39;s legs. The signs of deformity were becoming harder to miss. She spoke with quiet caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should stop using whatever Stacey gave you.Keep that up, and you might end up like Nicolas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey flinched. Her voice turned meek. &#34;I never mishandled Mom&#39;s medicine. It was you who cut it off.Her pain never eased after that. I only asked Marsha to help her feel better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie narrowed her eyes. Was she supposed to carry the blame again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t waste another word. Turning on her heel,she walked away. Tessa, realizing that she still needed Rylie&#39;s treatment, swallowed her frustration. Her tone softened. &#34;Rylie, I know how skilled you are. Aetheris Pharmacy even recognizes your ability. You wouldn&#39;t be able to afford those high-end prescriptions otherwise. Though you&#39;re not my biological daughter,I&#39;ve raised you for nearly twenty years, and I do care about you. I don&#39;t want to see your talent wasted here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stopped mid-step and looked back. &#34;Wasted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa nodded with a rehearsed smile. &#34;I&#39;ll make a new announcement. You and your mother will live with us.From now on, you&#39;ll be my private medical adviser.You&#39;ll handle my prescriptions and give me massages.Isn&#39;t that better than playing servant in this house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s lips twitched. Tessa always managed to sound generous while being selfish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a short laugh. &#34;The Kirk family fell apart because of foolish people like you. You keep stirring messes no one wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey sprang up, defensive. &#34;Rylie! Mom always meant well. Why do you keep turning on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia had kept quiet until now, but the shift in the servants&#39; faces caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for Tessa&#39;s arm to keep her from saying more. But Tessa, too full of pride to listen, pressed on Her voice aimed at the servant beside Rylie. &#34;That girl was adopted into our family. I did everything I could to raise her, but she turned out wrong. Always wild.Never proper. And you let her and her mother stay here, like nothing&#39;s wrong. Do you even realize the kind of trouble they might bring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant who was mistaken for Rylie&#39;s mother stiffened. Her eyes were filled with disbelief and fury.&#34;Mrs. Kirk, Miss Kirk, what are you talking about? I am Before she could finish, a new voice rang out. &#34;What&#39;s all this noise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, just returning from a visit to the music association, spotted the commotion. His eyes narrowed as he made his way toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s entire face lit up at the sight of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa, recognizing the cut of his suit and the quality of his watch, immediately toned down her attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia, quick to adjust, stepped forward with a polished smile. &#34;Good afternoon, Mr. Owen. I&#39;m Octavia Dury.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus returned a slight nod, then looked at Rylie.&#34;There&#39;s a package at the entrance waiting for your signature. It&#39;s been sitting there for some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she heard his warm and familiar tone directed at Rylie, Octavia&#39;s stomach turned. A sense of dread settled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie cast a glance at Tessa, then looked to Marcus with deliberate calm. &#34;The Kirks tried to stop me from working for the Owen family. They wanted me to go back and serve as Mrs. Kirk&#39;s private masseuse instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single person spoke. The air hung heavy with silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa, unaware of how dire the moment had become,rushed to speak. &#34;Mr. Owen, you probably don&#39;t know,but this girl used to be part of our household. I&#39;m just trying to help her avoid a life of drudgery. I don&#39;t want her trapped in a seivant&#39;s role like her mother. My intentions are kind-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant beside Rylie had finally heard enough.Her voice rang out sharp with fury. &#34;What sort of nonsense is that? How could Miss Owen be my daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s fawning smile slipped away in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus turned to her. His voice remained polite, but the chill in his words made the warning unmistakable.&#34;Is that how you speak of the Owen family&#39;s daughter?You dare say she&#39;s a maid? A masseuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words landed hard. Tessa felt the shock ripple through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees gave slightly under her. &#34;What...What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Octavia looked as if lightning had cracked through a calm sky. She froze, eyes wide. Rylie? The long-lost daughter of the Owen family? If that were true, then her son had nearly married into the Owen family-without even knowng it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization struck with brutal force. In a blink,everything made sense-the way Fred had gained that three-hundred-million-project-the way it had been yanked away just as quickly. It had all been because of Rylie. Had they left the engagement untouched,their family could&#39;ve broken into the elite class of society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret burned through Octavia, leaving her face tight with remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey,unwilling to accept it, blurted out loud, &#34;Rylie?That girl from nowhere? You&#39;re saying she&#39;s an Owen?That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could respond, a reprimanding voice echoed nearby. &#34;Why so much noise? Mr. Kendrick Owen is trying to rest!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An old butler trailed behind Kendrick as he made his way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie, whose expression was usually unreadable,now wore a faint smile as she stepped toward the old man.&#34;Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached with ease and added softly, &#34;I hope we didn&#39;t disturb your rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Age steals sleep from us. Don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;Kendrick placed a gentle hand on her head. His eyes were warm with affection. &#34;What&#39;s all this ruckus?&#34; He paused briefly, noticing her attire. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you dressed yet? Didn&#39;t you plan to meet Paola at six for the charity gala?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her tone light as she answered, &#34;Yes, I just bumped into a few familiar faces.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick turned to Tessa and asked Rylie plainly,&#34;What were you discussing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus answered before she could speak, &#34;Not much,really. They were just saying Rylie should go back to being Mrs. Kirk&#39;s personal masseuse. A live-in servant,essentially.What do you think of that,Grandpa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s expression changed in an instant. The warmth in his eyes faded. &#34;So you think the daughter of the Owen family should be sent back as someone&#39;s household help? After how you treated her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s complexion turned ghostly. &#34;That&#39;s not what meant. I had no idea Rylie was from the Owen bloodline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick gave a cold, bitter laugh. He cast a hard look at Octavia and snapped, &#34;Do you really believe all those business opportunities landed in your hands by coincidence? And then you come here and speak so proudly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,no,no, I didn&#39;t mean it! I never said a thing about this!&#34; Octavia, overcome by panic, nearly dropped to her knees. &#34;I never insulted Rylie. This is all Tessa&#39;s fault. She&#39;s the one who caused this. Our family has always thought highly of Rylie. It&#39;s Stacey who ruíned everything by chasing after Fred. If not for her, Rylie would have been part of our family by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to save face, Octavia scrambled to recover the situation, adding, &#34;Once we return, we&#39;ll break off all ties with the Kirks. I swear it. Please, Mr. Owen,show us some mercy. The Dury family can&#39;t survive without your support!&#34;</p>
