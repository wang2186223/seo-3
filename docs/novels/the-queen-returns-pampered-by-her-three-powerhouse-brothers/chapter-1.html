                <p>Nicolas Kirk&#39;s hand trembled as he flung the bowl at Rylie Kirk&#39;s feet, the crash ringing out across the room. Blood stained his lips while fury contorted his face. &#34;How could you do such a thing? What kind of sister would wish harm on her own brother?&#34; he said,his words splintered by a violent cough. &#34;I should&#39;ve listened to Stacey. She warned me about the poison!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s expression flickered as she looked down at the ruined medicine, disappointment shadowing her features. &#34;I keep telling you, Nicolas, there&#39;s nothing deadly in the medicine. It contains an ingredient that purges the old blood, which you need if you ever want to recover,&#34; said Rylie. Watching the medicine soak into the carpet, she winced inwardly, knowing how much effort and money she had poured into finding the right remedy for her eldest brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey Kirk, the adopted daughter of the Kirk family, stood at Nicolas&#39; side, her arms wrapped protectively around the medical text that she always carried.She raised her voice, tears prickling at her eyes. &#34;Please,Rylie, just stop making excuses. Leland ran tests on your concoction, and the results were dangerous. It&#39;s full of toxins!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold skepticism crossed Rylie&#39;s face as she met Stacey&#39;s gaze. &#34;You complete fool,&#34; Rylie said.&#34;There isn&#39;t a medicine in this world that&#39;s entirely safe, especially not for what Nicolas is suffering from. The only way to fight back is with a powerful dose. Thee&#39;s nothing mild that could work on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey could barely contain her tears, her voice quivering as she pleaded with Rylie, &#34;He&#39;s spitting up blood right in front of us, and you&#39;re still insisting this is the only way? We&#39;re just medical students, Rylie,not miracle workers. Don&#39;t put your pride above Nicolas&#39; life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a shaky step toward Rylie, Stacey continued,her words thick with emotion, &#34;I found a well-known specialist. He&#39;s already written a prescription that might actually save Nicolas. Admit you were wrong and let us try. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicolas doubled over, hacking up blood,and fixed Rylie with a glare that burned with outrage. &#34;It wasn&#39;t enough that you fed me that mystery medicine, now you turn on Stacey too? If you had even a fraction of her compassion, things wouldn&#39;t have come to this,&#34;Nicolas snapped. &#34;Apologize to her,right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie straightened her shoulders and faced Nicolas with an unflinching stare. &#34;All I ever wanted was to help you. I have done nothing that warrants an apology.I owe her nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation twisted Nicolas&#39; features as he scrambled to his feet, snatching a whip from the wall in a blind rage. &#34;That&#39;s it! You&#39;re going to push me into an early grave! Why can&#39;t you ever listen?&#34; he shouted. &#34;Get out! I don&#39;t want you here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the whip could lash out, Rylie shifted away,nimble and unafraid. From the upper landing,someone&#39;s measured steps echoed, and a battered backpack landed at her toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland Kirk, her second brother, stood at the base of the stairs. His tone cut through the air. &#34;Let&#39;s lay it out plainly. You&#39;re just an outsider, and Stacey is our true sibling. We&#39;ve kept this secret for your sake,hoping you wouldn&#39;t resent her, but today, we see just how cruel you can be. If you refuse to admit your mistakes, pack your things. We&#39;ll announce Stacey as our one and only/ sister. Your fortune goes with your name - you&#39;ll have to go back to your birth family and live as they do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a threat didn&#39;t faze Rylie. Years of living in the Kirk household had worn down her patience.However, the revelation that she was not bound to them by blood came almost as a blessing. HHer chest felt unburdened, lighter than it had in years. There was no need to waste any more of her knowledge or talent on a house that never valued her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought had struck her as odd - she always wondered why she stood out among siblings who never seemed to measure up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That suits me just fine.&#34; Rylie&#39;s voice held not a hint of regret. With quick fingers, she snatched up the backpack, plucked a candy from the bowl, and let it dissolve on her tongue as she strode for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left in the hallway, Stacey could not hold back a grin of satisfaction. Five years of plotting had finally paid off. With Rylie gone, she would be the Kirk family&#39;s prized daughter, adored and indulged by her brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she could not resist a final performance. She darted after Rylie, her voice ringing out. &#34;Rylie! Don&#39;t leave like this! You&#39;ll always have a place here!Please, don&#39;t make me feel like the villain. I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nicolas interjected sharply, &#34;Enough, Stacey! Let her go. A heart as cold as hers belongs to her own impoverished family. She never deserved this home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped Rylie when she overheard him.Was everyone in the Kirk family so easily fooled? Did they genuinely believe that it was sheer luck that had brought Nicolas back to health, gotten him out of bed, and made him able to walk again? Without her hands and her medicine, they&#39;d see soon enough just how far good fortune could take him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing the hood over her head, Rylie let the breeze whip strands of hair across her vivid lips, a flicker of scorn glinting in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far away, inside the bustling capital city of Kouhron,the imposing Owen Mansion stood as a symbol of influence and wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within that opulent hall, Kendrick Owen struck his ornate cane against the marble floor. &#34;You all promised she&#39;d been located. Why is she still not here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arrayed around him stood his three grandsons-each a commanding presence in his own right, men whose names carried enough weight that even the highest government officials paid their respects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite their stature, the shadow of their missing youngest sister dimmed their confidence, and their faces bore deep lines of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our search stalled in Crolens. According to the latest report, she spent some years in a mountain village, but after being trafficked, her whereabouts vanished fromn every record.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agony creased Kendrick&#39;s expression. &#34;For eighteen years, that child has been gone. Imagine the hardships she&#39;s endured in a place like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandfather, there&#39;s been progress. One of the kidnappers came forward and claimed she was later sold to a rich woman in Crolens. We only need a bit more time-her discovery is within reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief softened Kendrick&#39;s features. No trace of irritation remained as he rose from his chair,hope radiating from his gaze, &#34;In that case, let&#39;s not delay.I&#39;m comng with you. We&#39;ll search together.&#34;</p>
