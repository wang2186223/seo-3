            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>A heavy backpack slung over her shoulder, Rylie walked out of the Kirk residence without a backward glance, heading directly to the parking lot where her prized,limited-edition motorcycle waited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of downplaying her skills and masking her sharpness for the sake of the Kirk family&#39;s fragile peace were finally behind her. Freedom now tasted real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down the city streets, her motorcycle roared, slicing through the afternoon air until she arrived at the imposing entrance of a gated community near a military compound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the checkpoint, security protocols ran tight as always, but the instant Rylie&#39;s motorcycle appeared,the guard broke into a broad smile and opened the gate wide. &#34;Miss Kirk, your visits are always a welcome surprise.&#34; With a practiced motion, Rylie flipped up her visor and gave a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, cherry blossom petals scented the breeze,and several retired officers meandered beneath the blooming trees. Spotting her approach, they made their way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look who&#39;s back- Rylie, I was just about to see you. I&#39;ve run out of those pills you mixed up for me last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her motorcycle came to a halt as she peeled off her helmet, her gentle features drawing nods of approval. &#34;You can swing by the clinic tomorrow. I&#39;ll be here all day if you need a refill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of another familiar face, she gestured toward an elderly man still sporting a neck brace.&#34;As for you, I&#39;ve told you before that brace is only maing things worse for your neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An embarrassed grin spread across his face as he removed the brace. &#34;Would you at least allow me to try a few easy exercises?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it slow, and don&#39;t do anything reckless,&#34; said Rylie, stepping inside an apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long ago, her connection to this community began unexpectedly. During a visit to the Military General Hospital to buy medicine, she had encountered an elderly man suffering from epilepsy. With a prescription that targeted his condition at the root,she gave him relief that no other doctor had managed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That stranger turned out to be a celebrated, now-retired clinical specialist. Awed by Rylie&#39;s abilities, he insisted on calling her his savior and offered her an apartment in the community as thanks.①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Easy rapport filled the community, and its prime location made life peaceful and convenient. In time,Rylie had come to see this place as the home that she had always needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as shestepped inside her apartment, lights flickered on and a soft, familiar mechanical voice greeted her. &#34;Welcome home, Rylie. You&#39;ve been gone for three days. There are two encrypted oicemails waiting, your email inbox has new messages, and your bath is ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her backpack landed with a thud on the floor,sending the zipper flying open. A thick bundle of cash spilled out, scattering across the entryway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the pile of bills, guessing that it must total around ten grand. The sound that escaped her lips was half a chuckle, half a sneer. Was that really all the Kirks thought she was worth, tossing money her way like she was some beggar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Play my messages,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Britton Davies&#39; voice filled the room first, recorded late the previous evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Rylie, registration for the relay&#39;s almost up -two practice runs down already! Are you honestly still clinging to the Kirks? For real? I&#39;ve béen wiping the floor with Phillip these past few days!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight arch in her brow gave away her recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip Kirk, her third brother, ran one of the most exclusive racing clubs in the world, churning out champions and stacking up prize money.Long nights spent behind the wheel were her secret, pushing his team to one victory after another. Yet each season,as the finals approached, Phillip would swap her out for Stacey,handing over the glory and the gold.Year after year, her skills powered their success, but when the spotlight appeared, Stacey was ushered in for the celebration, leaving Rylie invisible to the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trophies meant little to her. In those days, protecting her family&#39;s ego mattered more. But now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin spread across her face as she called Britton.&#34;I want half of the prize money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever disappointment Britton had felt vanished at once. &#34;Done! Phillip&#39;s team doesn&#39;t scare me. I&#39;ve mapped out every move they make, but when you&#39;re behind the wheel, nobody can keep up. I never lose to him, Rylie-I always lose to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small laugh escaped Rylie as she let out a soft sigh. &#34;You&#39;ve noticed it too. Funny how obvious it is,but they still manage to overlook everything I do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity lit Britton&#39;s voice as he switched topics. &#34;By the way, something else came up. There&#39;s been chatter on the dark wveb about the Owen family-the wealthiest folks in Kouhron. Word is,they&#39;re here in Crolens, searching for their missing daughter and throwing around serious money for information.Think we should get involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Rylie answered, &#34;No interest.have finals coming up, so I&#39;ll pass. See you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On Britton&#39;s end, confusion crept in. Of all the reasons to bail, exams were the last thing that he would expect from Rylie. As far as he could recall,she never even showed up for tests. The truth was,she was the one who wrote them.</p>
