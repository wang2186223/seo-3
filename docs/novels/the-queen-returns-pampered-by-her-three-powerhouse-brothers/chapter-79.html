                <p>Paola&#39;s eyes flickered at Rylie&#39;s words. A question formed in her mind-had Marcus really invited Rylie as a special guest?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella snapped, &#34;Alright, Miss Owen, we all remember how you caused a scene at the last auction. I&#39;ll admit you&#39;ve got some taste, but Marcus only invites top-tier musicians. Are you one of them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie smirked.&#34;I could be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella rolled her eyes and scoffed. &#34;I studied music formally. I know all the top musicians, except for the mysterious X. Aria. And you, Miss Owen-I&#39;ve never heard of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola quietly agreed. X. Aria had lived abroad for years and was known only through his music. It didn&#39;t seem likely Rylie had any ties to someone like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola didn&#39;t doubt Rylie had some talent, but as a special guest? That was hard to believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her gaze and said softly, &#34;Rylie, today is Marcus&#39; solo concert. I want everything to go perfectly,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people nearby began to look at Rylie with disapproval. Baila frowned. &#34;Miss Owen, Paola is your cousin,so maybe you think you can push her around. But today isn&#39;t the day. Don&#39;t embarrass the Owen family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood, then glanced around. &#34;But if I don&#39;t sit in front, I won&#39;t have a seat at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola smiled gently. &#34;Then take mine. I&#39;ll stand beside you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella muttered under her breath, &#34;So Marcus didn&#39;t even give her a ticket? She&#39;s in the standing area.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baila added, &#34;Not every Owen likes this girl who suddenly popped up. She&#39;s nowhere near Paola&#39;s level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another woman chimed in, &#34;Paola is also a guest of Marcus. She can&#39;t be standing at the back-what does that look like? Since Rylie has a standing ticket, she should stand. She&#39;s still an Owen, after all. How can she take someone else&#39;s seat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie had seen through these little tricks before-with Stacey, with others. Back then, she&#39;d sayed quiet for the sake of family, and it only made things worse. She wasn&#39;t going to make the same mistake twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached for her phone to call Marcus over to deal with them, a deep, lazy voice interrupted.&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice was familiar. She turned, stunned, as the spotlight caught a tall figure walking in. Brad&#39;s once pale skin now glowed with health. His sharp features, high nose bridge, and that faint smile made him stand out effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked straight toward her. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you sit? You got here before me.&#34; He sat down on the VIP sofa next to her and looked up with a light smile. Then he scooted to one side and patted the narrow space left.&#34;What are you standing for? I bought a standing ticket. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going back on your word and won&#39;t let me sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps followed.The women stared in disbelief. Had Rylie bought the VIP seat-and Brad was just tagging along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie hesitated but eventually sat down in the small space he had made for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of them sitting shoulder to shoulder shifted the mood entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused looks circled the room. Wasn&#39;t this Brad- the naval hero? The admiral who rose to the top by thirty? Head of a powerful family? Yet here he was, sitting beside Rylie so casually... Amost intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s heart clenched. Her fingers gripped her dress tightly, though her face remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you did have a seat, Rylie,&#34; Paola said with a strained smile. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you say something?|misunderstood. Everyone, please sit. The concert&#39;s about to begin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ladies kept quiet, but their eyes couldn&#39;t help drifting back to Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The single VIP seat wasn&#39;t spacious, so their arms and shoulders brushed together. The faint cedar scent from Brad, laced with a bit of medicine, mixed with his body&#39;s warmth, making Rylie stiffen slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad leaned in with a teasing tone. &#34;Dr. Owen, nervous? I thought you didn&#39;t care about my body. But it seems you quite like the way I look dressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was low, and she felt the vibration through his chest as it reached her shoulder- soft and strangely electric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie adjusted her position, and her knee brushed his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad chuckled and suddenly placed a hand on her waist. &#34;Stop moving. You&#39;re about to push me off the seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His touch was warm, steady- and left her no room to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were locked on them now, especially Paola, whose expression twisted slightly, like she&#39;d just tasted something bitter. Who would&#39;ve thought the usually cold Brad could be this close with Rylie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t pull away. Once she was settled, she replied lightly, &#34;No wonder Deandre calls you a flirt.I see it now for myself.&#34;</p>
