                <p>Paola&#39;s eyes shifted. Then, with practiced ease, she slipped into a sorrowful look. &#34;Brad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp click rang out as Brad closed his lighter. He straightened from where he had been leaning against the rail and began to descend the steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd, made up of heirs and high-society offspring, instinctively moved aside, parting to make way for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her eyes on him as he walked forward. His presence was rare in places like this. Still, every glance, every whisper, every breath turned in his direction, drawn in like water pulled by a whirlpool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t flinch at the attention. At the edge of the dance floor, he paused and lifted his chin slightly.&#34;What&#39;s the fuss this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy, eager for Brad&#39;s approval, jumped down from the stage and pointed at Rylie. &#34;It was her. She almost hurt my sister. She&#39;s always like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola tugged on his arm. Her voice softened,her eyes dropped, and she interrupted gently. &#34;Please don&#39;t say that. Rylie didn&#39;t mean anything. I wasn&#39;t pushed. I just slipped. Please don&#39;t blame her, Brad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie folded her arms. She watched Paola put on the act, her face unreadable. The dramatics would&#39;ve won an award. She couldn&#39;t confront Paola here, but outside, a stern talking-to in the alley was certainly on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blind spot? That wasn&#39;t hard for Rylie to find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had something planned already. Nothing too elegant. Just enough to settle the score. But Brad&#39;s sudden step into the mess threw her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A bet&#39;s a bet. It has to be kept.&#34; Brad&#39;s calm voice cut through the noise. He looked at Percy and spoke again. &#34;This is something you should&#39;ve learned in grade school.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy tensed. His lips parted, ready to argue. Brad didn&#39;t give him the chance. &#34;You&#39;d rather break your word than lose face? And now you&#39;ve got your sister pretending she fell, so that you could escape from honoring the bet?&#34; He gave a small laugh. &#34;Is this what the Garretts teach their children?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That line settled the matter. Everyone caught it. Brad didn&#39;t count the Garrett siblings as part of the Owen name. Rylie didn&#39;t miss it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s face turned ashen. She reached out quickly and said, &#34;Brad, it&#39;s really not what you think-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad lifted his hand to stop her mid-sentence. His gaze had cooled, and his voice carried the weight of quiet disapproval. &#34;Paola, it&#39;s one thing for your brother to act like a child. But why are you making it worse by getting involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he shifted toward Percy. &#34;You started this. Now that you&#39;ve lost, you think backing out and blaming others is acceptable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved forward slowly, stopping just in front of Percy. &#34;Do you know what kind of person I can&#39;t stand?&#34; His tone dropped to a cutting chill. &#34;It&#39;s people like you. You stir up trouble and then hide behind someone else when it backfires. If that&#39;s how you handle pressure, how do you expect to serve in uniform?&#34; Percy turned pale and retorted loudly, &#34;I do admit l lost! I&#39;m just furious that Rylie pushed my sister.Brad, how can you take such a violent woman&#39;s side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad turned and looked at Rylie. &#34;Did you push her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a dry snort. &#34;If I had meant to do that, she wouldn&#39;t be standing upright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, knowing full well that she wasn&#39;t exaggerating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for Paola&#39;s shoulder. His words sounded kind, but a cold note slipped in. &#34;You&#39;ve always treated me as a friend. If this truly isn&#39;t your fault, I&#39;l make sure you get the justice you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s heart thudded, thinking maybe he still felt something for her. She offered a soft voice,trying to sound gracious. &#34;Thank you, Brad. But I&#39;m really okay. We can just let this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad shook his head. &#34;I won&#39;t falsely accuse anyone.But I won&#39;t let anyone escape blame either. Rylie owes you a proper explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Ronan&#39;s eyes found Brad&#39;s. He hesitated for a second, then said as he grasped what Brad wanted him to do, &#34;There was a recent inspection. I ended up fixing the bar&#39;s cameras. The recording should be available. I&#39;ll bring it over, Mr.Morgan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s face, once bright with hope, suddenly tightened. The recording available? The timing couldn&#39;t have been worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward quickly. &#34;There&#39;s no need, Brad.It&#39;s fine. Really.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy gripped her hand. &#34;Paola, don&#39;t let this go just because you&#39;re nice. Rylie has to apologize. Let&#39;s check the footage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a sharp smile, eyes shining with  amusement. &#34;Yes. Let&#39;s do that. I&#39;m all for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad pointed toward the largest screen in the room.&#34;You know what to do. Put it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked back at Paola. Her face had gone pale. Still, he smiled gently and said, &#34;You&#39;ll never be mistreated while I&#39;m around, Paola. Not on my watch.&#34;</p>
