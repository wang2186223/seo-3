                <p>Rylie moved on to the next voicemail, which turned out to be from Rory Carter, one of the most respected physicians at the Military General Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A note of flattery colored Rory&#39;s tone as he spoke.&#34;Rylie, I&#39;m really in a bind. One of my old friend&#39;s sons has battled a rare illness for years, and his health is declining again. Those special pills you provided aren&#39;t helping him any longer. Is there any chance you could stop by and take a look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, Rylie dialed him back.&#34;I&#39;ll come to the clinic after classes tomorrow evening.Tell him to swing by then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory cut in with an apologetic sigh, saying, &#34;He&#39;s stuck in the VIP wing at the hospital, and strict protocols mean he can&#39;t leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drumming her fingers on the tabletop, Rylie pressed for details. &#34;Enough stalling, Rory. Who&#39;s the patient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Rory&#39;s voice dropped to a whisper,saying, &#34;It&#39;s Brad Morgan. Yes, the grandson of General Sean Morgan. This isn&#39;t just any case-the Morgans have discreetly reached out to top doctors nationwide. They&#39;re offering twenty million dollars to anyone who can cure him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An arched eyebrow was all the reaction Rylie gave.The Morgan family was legendary, led by Sean Morgan, a formidable general. He was a man even the President deferred to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name Brad Morgan brought back memories-she remembered reading about him in the news.Only thirty and already hailed as the youngest admiral of his era, his string of military victories made headlines everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation puzzled Rylie. Something could actually bring down a man like Brad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next move was to check her encrypted contract inbox, and sure enough, there sat an official invitation from the National Healthcare Department.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Working under the codename &#34;Healing Hand&#34; on the dark web, she had built a reputation for tackling medical mysteries, and eventually gathered an elite team of her own. It seemed natural that the government would come looking for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her composure, Rylie responded, &#34;I see the message. That reward would tempt anyone. I&#39;ll take the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, word of the Morgan family&#39;s urgent call reached the Kirks as well. Leland sprang into action,already strategizing and dialing contacts in hopes of getting their foot in the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always just out of reach of the upper society, the Kirk family saw this as their shot. Healing Brad would mean acceptance into the highest social circles at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another rumor had set the city abuzz: the wealthiest family in Kouhron landed in Crolens, promising a mind-blowing sum to anyone who could lead them to their missing daughter. People all across town had dropped everything, desperate for a piece of the reward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shrill ring of her phone yanked Rylie from sleep.She stretched and dragged herself out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end was Timothy Powell-her research advisor- barely masking his irritation. &#34;Rylie! I told you to handle the data organization, but you&#39;re nowhere in sight. Are you trying to get yourself kicked out of my research group? Stacey was here right at dawn. I expect you here immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered no answer, choosing instead to end the call and glance at the clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The digits read ten o&#39;clock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind flashed back to the previous night. Lost in old medical texts, she&#39;d worked long hours sorting through ancient prescriptions, and now she had t overslept, letting Timothy&#39;s task slip her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A yawn escaped as she flipped open her laptop, sent off a quick email, and hurried to get ready.Backpack in tow, shestepped out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her motorcycle zipped through city streets until she pulled up in front of the university lab. After finding a spot, she strode toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her pass and swiped it, only to watch the screen blink and flash a denial-her access had been revoked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the lab doors swung open and out came Stacey, flanked by two upperclassmen from the research team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smile twisted one guy&#39;s lips as he spotted her dilemma. &#34;So, Rylie, you think you&#39;re special?Turning up late, ditching your work -looks like you finally pushed Professor Powell too far. Lab access is locked, and your days here are over!&#34;</p>
