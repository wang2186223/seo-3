                <p>Vivian beamed with pride, pulling Stacey forward.&#34;Meet Stacey Kirk, a prodigy in medical research-my own student and the mastermind behind the Nexo-7 serum. She played a pivotal role in Rylie&#39;s last formulation, and this new version is even more refined. It&#39;s perfectly safe for Mr. Morgan, and the benefits will only increase with use.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an arch of her brow, Rylie let her words linger in the air. &#34;Is that so? I suppose I should see for myself just how flawless Stacey&#39;s serum really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brad was elsewhere, catching up with an old comrade in one of the private rooms,leaving Rylie to oversee things on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s knuckles turned white as she forced a smile, nails digging into her palms. &#34;Of course, Rylie and I are family, after all. It&#39;s only natural our research would reflect one another&#39;s skills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland, standing at the edge of the group, let out a scornful laugh. &#34;You don&#39;t have to sugarcoat it,Stacey.Everyone knows Rylie&#39;s been taking credit for your breakthroughs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie couldn&#39;t help but marvel at his foolishness. She had gotten full scores of that difficult exam,yet here he was, still convinced that she had cheated and copied Stacey&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cut the tension with a brisk command, saying,&#34;Let&#39;s see the serum, then. Bring it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of doubt flickered across Stacey&#39;s face,but she remembered-no one here but Rylie could ever achieve a high-purity result. Gaining some composure, she insisted, &#34;For the sake of the patient, Rylie, we should administer the serum without any unnecessary delay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled from Rylie. &#34;No need to look, then.The serum you&#39;re holding is a fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room shifted, every face changing. Vivian&#39;s expression soured. &#34;Rylie, my student put in the work for these results. On what basis do you claim the serum&#39;s a forgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey didn&#39;t miss a beat, her voice trembling with wounded pride. &#34;Rylie, do you really want a repeat of what happened with Nicolas? You should be responsible for your words and actions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nearby doctor, curiosity piqued, glanced over.&#34;What&#39;s this about Nicolas? Do you mean Mr. Nicolas Kirk, still in this hospital? What&#39;s his connection to Rylie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle voice, Stacey answered, &#34;Nicolas has never recovered. The serum Rylie created poisoned him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s resentment only grew sharper at the mention. &#34;Our parents will be back soon, Rylie. After what you did to Nicolas, the Kirk family will never take you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their accusations painted Rylie as a villain, and suspicion rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hospital administrators, remembering Rylie&#39;s connection to Brad, tried to intervene, replying, &#34;Mr.Morgan must have been misled. We should administer the serum to him right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Rylie strode over to Stacey, snatched the box from her grasp, and removed the vial for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she revealed was a bottle of serum so unnaturally violet that it looked toxic. Her lips curled in scorn. &#34;And you call yourselves doctors? Don&#39;t you realize high-purity Nexo-7 is deadly if injected straight into the bloodstream?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group was left speechless by this blunt challenge from such a young person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Vivian faltered-she&#39;d never known about this danger. Her anger flared. &#34;If I&#39;ve never heard of it,then it can&#39;t possibly be true! You&#39;re just making things up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buoyed by Vivian&#39;s support, Stacey chimed in, her confidence returning. &#34;Rylie, stop acting like you&#39;re some expert. You&#39;re making it all up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie retorted, unflinching, &#34;Just because you&#39;re ignorant doesn&#39;t mean the facts change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tempers were rising and voices sharpening when, at that very moment, the elevator doors slid open -and Brad entered, accompanied by a striking woman in a crisp white coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Marsha appeared, a glimmer of hope flickered in Stacey&#39;s eyes. She wasted no time adopting a fragile, wounded expression. &#34;Marsha,thank goodness you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha made a show of lingering beside Brad, as if she and he shared a private understanding.Her voice was all gentle authority. &#34;Is there a problem? Has the serum been prepared? We shouldn&#39;t keep Mr.Morgan waiting much longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s eyes flickered toward Rylie, standing slightly a targeted, and misunderstood despite her obvious brilliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he stepped forward, subtly placing himself in front of her, a protective gesture that spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something wrong with the serum,&#34; Brad said, his toneflat and absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie, startled by this open show of trust, felt a softness that she hadn&#39;t expected. She gave a small nod. &#34;He&#39;s right - the serum&#39;s a counterfeit. I&#39;ve never seen Nexo-7 that shade. It must be contaminated or switched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s support rattled Stacey, who saw her social standing suddenly at risk. Tears welled in her eyes,her voice trembling with fury. &#34;Rylie, why are you making up stories? Are you trying to destroy everything I&#39;ve worked for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wobbled, Leland rushed to steady her,shooting a cold glare at Rylie. &#34;Isn&#39;t it enough that you&#39;re always stirring up drama? This isn&#39;t a game-  tampering with the serum could be fatal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her voice level and calm. &#34;Raw,unprocessed Nexo-7 is highly toxic. If you inject it directly, you&#39;ll only make things worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Brad gravitated to Rylie gnawed at Marsha.Not long ago, even Felix, the wealthy Owen heir,had overlooked her expertise. For once, she wanted recognition for her own skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin, determined to display her knowledge. &#34;I&#39;ve never heard of any detoxification step for this compound. In our practice,we use it straight. People who don&#39;t understand the medicine should stay silent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to fall in line, Leland rounded on Rylie. &#34;Marsha is the top of her class - she&#39;d never mislead anyone.Rylie,stop humiliating yourself and get out of here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the scolding, Rylie turned to Brad and asked, &#34;Do you still trust this place enough to go through with treatment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t answer immediately. He calmly pulled out his phone, dialed Evita, and set it to speaker. His voice was measured and clear. &#34;I need your expertise on something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t often Brad called, so Evita answered promptly, her tone instantly deferential, &#34;Yes, Mr.Morgan, what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got right to the point. &#34;Is high-purity Nexo-7dangerous if used straight from the vial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause followed before Evita spoke again. &#34;That&#39;s an unusual question, Mr.Morgan. High-purity Nexo-7is absolutely toxic without detoxification. It&#39;s nothing like ordinary serums. I assumed you&#39;d know that-you just had a high-purity dose yourself, and the detoxification process was necessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita hadn&#39;t always known about this, but after witnessing Rylie carefully neutralize the serum before Brad&#39;s last injection, she couldn&#39;t deny that the procedure was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words settled in, an uneasy silence swept over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita, hearing the silence on the other end, felt that something was amiss. &#34;Mr. Morgan, what happened?&#34;</p>
