                <p>Rylie scribbled a brief prescription, handing it to the woman with a reassuring nod. &#34;You&#39;re only dealing with some swollen lymph nodes from a common cold. Take these anti-inflammatories for a few days.If it were really a tumor, your lymph nodes would be hard, much larger, and you&#39;d be feeling pain or other symptoms,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s relief was obvious as she nodded enthusiastically. &#34;I feel just fine! A free checkup at a local clinic told me something was wrong and sent me to VitaLink for more tests. That&#39;s what got me so anxious!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brows knitted in concern, &#34;No surgery is needed here. Just stick with the medicine l&#39;ve given you and you&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she&#39;d seen the last patients off and the market had emptied, Selah packed up the last of her supplies and walked beside Rylie into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On their way home, Selah&#39;s anger bubbled over. &#34;You know, the doctors at VitaLink are notorious for this-they exaggerate minor problems, scare people,and push them into expensive surgeries, eventhough,in fact, a couple of dollars&#39; worth of pills would fix most of it. They just keep wringing every penny out of the patients - even the poor are their targets. I&#39;ve watched it happen over and over, and it makes my blood boil.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;I share some of the blame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew that VitaLink Hospital operated under the Wilde family&#39;s control, and Rylie&#39;s school was deeply connected. Several college deans even held leadership positions there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland, after med school, joined VitaLink&#39;s staff.Through his ties, Rylie had done many for the Wildes - granting them rare medications, pulling strings at Aetheris Pharmacy, and even arranging for famous doctors to consult at their hospital. Those favors fueled the Wildes&#39; reputation as Crolens&#39; top medical family, bringing prestige and a steady flood of new patients to VitaLink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing all this, Selah gave Rylie&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze. &#34;You have to fix this, Rylie. The Wildes can&#39;t be allowed to use your influence to make money by hurting innocent people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie agreed without hesitation. She pulled out her phone and sent a message to a secure contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her text was blunt: &#34;Publish a statement on the dark web from Aetheris Pharmacy and Healing Hand: The Wilde family is guilty of greed and malpractice,endangering lives for profit. Aetheris Pharmacy is severing all ties with them. From now on, anyone connected to the Wildes is considered an enemy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reply landed within seconds.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement spread like wildfire across the dark web. Everyone knew the unmatched power behind Aetheris Pharmacy-especially with Healing Hand&#39;s reputation. Nobody dared cross them. The Wilde family&#39;s downfall was all but sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing opportunity, rival families rushed to fill the void, eager to claim the resources and status that the Wildes were about to lose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie and Selah made their way through the lively city streets, weaving between stalls and laughter until they finally paused before a modest, unassuming pharmacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far from the imposing Aetheris Pharmacy,HaloFlow Pharmacy operated with quiet persistence,its shelves stocked thanks to Aetheris funding. Even as midnight approached, a steady stream of patients slipped in and out beneath its flickering sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Selah was safely home, Rylie headed back to the military compound, unaware of the pair of eyes watching from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucked in a dark corner, a stranger snapped photos of the little pharmacy, sending each one off to Evita along with a running report. Rage twisted Evita&#39;s features as she read the message. &#34;Now I see why our numbers are tanking.Some dried-up hag is siphoning off my business,keeping people from signing up for surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef chimed in, a note of triumph in his voice,&#34;That girl and the old woman are partners. They aren&#39;t even with Aetheris - they&#39;re just selling medicine from HaloFlow right next door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop there; Yosef produced a set of photos and handed them over. &#34;Look. I got some proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Evita&#39;s eyes landed on Selah&#39;s face, her expression hardened.&#34;So it&#39;s her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef was quick to catch the shift. &#34;You recognize her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita&#39;s mouth curled with resentment. &#34;She&#39;s not just some stranger. Selah and I were rivals in medical school. She always fancied herself the superior doctor, tried to poach my patients, and wound up destroying her own career after a fatal mistake. I had no idea she&#39;d hold a grudge for so long.&#34; Her voice sharpened. &#34;No way Rylie could have made that high-purity compound alone. Selah&#39;s the one orchestrating things from behind the scenes. Rylie&#39;s just her puppet-not even a real member of Aetheris Pharmacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what&#39;s the next move?&#34; Yosef asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold smile crept across Evita&#39;s lips. &#34;If those two nobodies think they can outmaneuver us, they&#39;re in for a shock. Send someone to rough up that tiny pharmacy and warn Selah. Then, deliver a phony invitation- if she&#39;s so skilled, let&#39;s see her treat that Morgan patient all by herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef hesitated, uncertainty flickering in his eyes.&#34;But there&#39;s only one official invitation from the Morgan family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita&#39;s glare was cold. &#34;Who said to use the real thing? Forge it. I want her embarrassed beyond repair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked grin spread across Yosef&#39;s face. &#34;I know exactly what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their scheming had barely ended when Marsha Wilde burst into the room, panic etched across her features. &#34;Grandma, something awful has happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita shot her a look of disapproval. &#34;So much for the &#39;Genius Healer&#39; title. Is this how you show composure? Get a hold of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha hurried closer, her voice trembling.&#34;Grandma, it&#39;s Aetheris Pharmacy. They just went public, cutting all ties with the Wilde family. Anyone who supports us is now their enemy! I tried to buy medicine from them today, and they blocked me instantly! What are we supposed to do?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Wilde family owed much of its prestige and profit to the exclusive medicines and technology from Aetheris Pharmacy. People only flocked to them because of this partnership. Now, Aetheris Pharmacy had declared war, and the fallout would be devastating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita&#39;s face drained of color as she collapsed back into her chair, panic overtaking her practiced calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did it come to this? Why would Healing Hand turn against us? I&#39;ve always treated them with deference-why destroy us now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear the thought. With Aetheris Pharmacy&#39;s blacklist shutting them out, the Wilde family&#39;s future crumbled before her eyes. VitaLink Hospital&#39;s hard-earned reputation and steady profits would be wiped away overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must be because they caught wind of our schemes,&#34; Marsha whispered, near tears. &#34;What are we going to do, Grandma? I can&#39;t lose everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Yosef&#39;s support, Evita rose shakily to her feet,fighting to compose herself. &#34;The Owen family&#39;s eldest son is still recovering from surgery in our hospital. They&#39;re from Kouhron - they won&#39;t know what&#39;s happening on the dark web. For now, we act as if nothing is amiss. This is our chance to secure an alliance with the Owens for protection, do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Images of Felix&#39;s striking features flashed through Marsha&#39;s mind, helping her regain her composure. &#34;I understand, Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exam results day had finally arrived at the school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie parked her motorcycle and was about to head inside when she noticed a crowd of students gathered on either side of the entrance, their attention riveted on a gleaming silver-gray Panamera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the brand-new Panamera!&#34; someone whispered in awe. &#34;Costs more than three million. No wonder it&#39;s Mr. Dury&#39;s car- he&#39;s so wealthy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred Dury emerged from behind the wheel, exuding smug confidence, then circled the car to open the passenger door with a flourish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the crowd. &#34;It&#39;s Stacey! I was sure it&#39;d be Rylie!&#34; One girl sounded genuinely shocked, then quickly changed her tune. &#34;But really,who&#39;d want to be paired with that idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp-eyed student picked Rylie out from the throng, shooting her a look filled with spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An amused smile played on Rylie&#39;s lips. She nearly forgot that she had a fiancé.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when Stacey hadn&#39;t yet returned to the Kirk family, Fred was a regular at their home, endlessly inventing ways to curry Rylie&#39;s favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their engagement was arranged at Nicolas&#39;insistence, but Rylie never harbored even a shred of fondness for Fred. He lacked integrity, warmth, and sincerity - and his looks weren&#39;t even worth comparing to Brad&#39;s. As far as Rylie was concerned,Fred was barely a blip on her radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uninterested in either Fred or Stacey, Rylie turned to go, but before she could slip away, Stacey&#39;s keen gaze found her. &#34;Rylie!&#34; she called out.</p>
