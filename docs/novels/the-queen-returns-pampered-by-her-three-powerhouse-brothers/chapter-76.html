                <p>Deandre couldn&#39;t explain it, but watching Rylie pick up those perfectly sized steak pieces made him clench his jaw. The frustration didn&#39;t vanish, but he held it in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Deandre slid part of his steak toward her. &#34;This is mny first go at taking care of someone,Rylie. I&#39;m not some old guy with all the tricks, but I can manage this much. Go on, eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad paused mid-cut and glanced up. The look he gave Deandre meant that those words were unpleasant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre met his stare with one of his own. The message came through just as clearly, as if saying that Brad&#39;s words weren&#39;t any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a small shake of her head. &#34;Thanks, Deandre. But this portion&#39;s already enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no choice left; he retrieved the plate. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll just cut it up for you next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled faintly.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In moments like that, she felt deeply grateful for the people around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Rylie made her way to HaloFlow Pharmacy by herself. Selah hadn&#39;t seen her in a while.As soon as Rylie stepped inside, Selah reached out and held both her hands, checking her from head to toe.&#34;You&#39;re safe, right? That Wildes group didn&#39;t hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Selah,&#34; she said. &#34;Is it busy today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really. A few regulars came in for meds. Nothing more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie fell silent for a few seconds before speaking. &#34;Have you ever considered starting a hospital again?Something official? You run a small clinic and treat everyone all by yourself every day. It looks tiring. If you have a hospital, we can recruit excellent doctors and treat more patients, and you won&#39;t be this exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah didn&#39;t answer at first. Then, after a long pause, she gave a small shake of her head. &#34;Helping people this way is enough for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept going. &#34;But haven&#39;t you wanted to clear your name?&#34; She looked straight at her. &#34;I don&#39;t believe you caused anyone&#39;s death. There&#39;s probably more to what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah froze for a moment but stayed quiet on the details. &#34;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;m happy with HaloFlow pharmacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing that Selah didn&#39;t want to revisit the past, Rylie changed her tone. &#34;Maybe we could expand the HaloFlow Pharmacy? We can build some wards and consultation rooms. Some patients want to stay a few nights. It doesn&#39;t feel right to send them away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah didn&#39;t say yes, but she didn&#39;t say no either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie figured it was a start. Given time, she believed she could help guide Selah back to leading a hospital again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing dinner with Selah, Rylie made her way back to Serenity Manor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped inside, she noticed a servant lingering near the hall who immediately darted away at the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Rylie raised a brow and followed the woman&#39;s hurried steps, only to catch sight of Paola slipping out of her bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you doing in my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had caught her red-handed. The servant turned pale and backed away without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola was extremely embarrassed but couldn&#39;t admit the truth. She fumbled for an excuse. &#34;Last time the servant cleaned your room, they left something that belongs to me behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Rylie tilted her head. &#34;And what exactly was left behind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrambling to maintain her cover, Paola reached into her pocket and pulled out a hairpin..&#34;This!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie took one glance and gave a half-smile.&#34;This?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Paola picked it up and brushed past her. &#34;You probably won&#39;t believe it, but Marcus gave this to me.&#34; She paused halfway down the hall and tossed a glance over her shoulder.&#34;And just so you know, he invited me to his solo concert. He&#39;s the main act.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave her a calm look. &#34;That so? Then explain why you&#39;re rummaging through my drawer for sheet music.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s smug expression vanished in an instant. &#34;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&lt;</p>
