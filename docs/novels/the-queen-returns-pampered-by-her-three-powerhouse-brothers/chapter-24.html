                <p>Everyone turned to see what the commotion was about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the Owen relatives, except for Rylie&#39;s brothers, expected her to look rough and run-down because of where she came from. What they saw instead left them stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie walked in wearing a leather jacket and fitted black pants. Her skin looked so smooth that it almost glowed. Her features, sharp yet graceful, mirrored her brothers&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering how Felix, Marcus, and Deandre each had the kind of looks people remembered,it was only natural that Rylie had a striking face too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s heart dropped. Her fingers curled tightly over her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my sweet granddaughter!&#34; Kendrick couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. He pushed himself up with his cane and stretched a hand toward her. &#34;Come here,quick. Let me really see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men standing beside him-Rylie&#39;s brothers -were clearly trying not tocry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie hadn&#39;t known family love in years. Kendrick&#39;s warmth felt unfamiliar but comforting. His wrinkled hand clutched hers with surprising strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re finally here,&#34; he said. Tears welled in Kendrick&#39;s eyes. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t found you, I wouldn&#39;t know what to say to your parents when I see them again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t know what to say. But the way he held her hand made her feel something she hadn&#39;t in a long time. She leaned closer and said gently,&#34;Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my dear girl!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That one word undid him. His heart felt full, like he could hand her everything he had and still want to give more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Felix. I&#39;m your oldest brother.&#34; Felix sat on the sofa, his voice soft with emotion. &#34;Can you believe my own sister ended up saving my life? That has to be fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie remembered the carved token that he had given her. She gave him a nod and asked, &#34;Weren&#39;t you supposed to be in the hospital for surgery? What brought you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t want to miss this,&#34; said Felix, his tone calm.&#34;We&#39;ve looked for you for so long. I&#39;ve waited years for this moment. The surgery can wait. A few days won&#39;t hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected anyone to care so deeply.Maybe this was what having a real family felt like. Her voice turned soft. &#34;Thanks, Felix. But your health matters more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here too,&#34; said the second man, stepping up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Marcus.&#34; Marcus greeted her with a warm hug, polite and kind. &#34;I knew it was you when I saw you at school. I just knew it. Turns out, what I said at that time was right-you&#39;re indeed my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave him a quiet smile in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last one was her third brother, the one sent to bring her home. Rylie turned toward Deandre and gave him a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s face lit up. &#34;What a blessing. All my grandchildren, finally together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Laurel Garrett, Rylie&#39;s aunt, broke the moment. &#34;Now that Rylie&#39;s back, will she stay here in Crolens or return to Kouhron?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Rylie noticed another family seated nearby. Kendrick gestured toward them. &#34;That&#39;s your aunt Laurel Garrett, and with her are her children Paola and Percy.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola rose with grace and gave Rylie a polite smile.&#34;It&#39;s lovely to meet.you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy Garrett stood up as well, though far less eag Kendrick turned back to Rylie with a gentle voice.&#34;Would you rather stay here for now, or come back to Kouhron with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie thought of Brad, stilI waiting for her care. She answered softly, &#34;I&#39;ll stay in Crolens for now.I haven&#39;t finished my studies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick gave a quiet nod. &#34;Then I&#39;ll stay here too.&#34;He turned toward Laurel. &#34;Have the rooms been arranged?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel hesitated, caught off guard. She hadn&#39;t expected Rylie to stay. Paola quickly spoke up.&#34;Mom&#39;s already making plans to convert my piano room into Rylie&#39;s bedroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel gave Paola a nod of approval. &#34;Yes, we&#39;ve already started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy&#39;s reaction was swift. He frowned and said,&#34;Why not just use the guest room? Why touch Paola&#39;s piano room? She&#39;s been working on a film score for Director Spencer Aguilar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer&#39;s films were always major hits, and his opening music drew huge attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel raised her eyebrows, pretending to be surprised. &#34;So Paola&#39;s gotten that good? No wonder she&#39;s been skipping meals and locking herself in that room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola glanced quickly at Marcus, then answered in a quiet voice. &#34;Marcus inspired me. That&#39;s the only reason I got this opportunity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel turned back to Rylie. &#34;Since Paola needs the piano room - how about we place you in the guest room for now? If you don&#39;t like it, we&#39;ll find you another. Just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, I really don&#39;t mind. My work is just a small matter.&#34; Paola forced a gracious tone. &#34;Let Rylie take the piano room. She&#39;s been away for years. I&#39;m sure she hasn&#39;t had a proper rest in a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By echoing Percy&#39;s words, she meant to make herself sound generous and kind-hearted. But things didn&#39;t unfold quite how she planned.</p>
