                <p>&#34;Have you thought about what we should call her?Percy calls her Rylie, but maybe we should use Miss Kirk instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s also the option of addressing her as Miss Owen.What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But even after she came back to the Owen family,they never made an official announcement. And even if she&#39;s an Owen, her personality is still so bad that she doesn&#39;t look like a gentlewoman at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy let out a loud snort. &#34;Nobody in my family has the time for details like that. My cousins are tangled up in their own problems, and Grandfather is busy throwing a spring gala for my sister, It&#39;s no surprise Rylie slipped through the cracks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Underneath these words was a clear message: Rylie barely mattered to them, just another invisible member tucked away in a house overflowing with money and secrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was simpler than any of them realized -Rylie just wanted a quiet life, away from flashy events and gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the spring gala, that was news to her. No one had ever mentioned it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in her chair, Rylie looked indifferent. &#34;It seems you truly care about the surname. But I&#39;m different; whether you think I am an Owen or a Kirk doesn&#39;t matter. Percy, neither you nor Paola goes by the Owen name, and that does hurt you so much,right? After all, you want to be considered part of the Owen family by the public, but the surname makes many think you&#39;re not. Interesting, l&#39;ve become an Owen without much effort, but you two just can&#39;t change your surname no matter how desperately you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That remark brought the conversation to a sudden halt, leaving the others scrambling for a response and making the tension in the air nearly tangible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cloud seemed to settle over Percy&#39;s face. &#34;My sister and I have spent our whole lives with the Owens. We&#39;re just as much a part of this family as anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of arguing, Rylie flashed a cool smile, let her eyes roam across the table crowded with paper cups,and flicked a ping pong ball into one, splashing beer onto the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;Funny, isn&#39;t it? Your father never built his fortune inside the Owen family. He was dirt poor until he moved in with the Garretts, becoming their live-in son-in-law. Only then were you and your sister born, both carrying your mother&#39;s last name.Technically, you belong to the Garretts, but here you are, still living under my roof. Maybe you should ask yourselves why that is. Could it be that there&#39;s something wrong with your own family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Percy&#39;s face, his embarrassment growing with every word.He always took pride in being recognized as an Owen, and hardly anyone dared bring up the Garrett name.Rylie&#39;s boldness cut deeper than he cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had intended to teach Rylie a lesson for his sister&#39;s sake, but instead, she had dominated the conversation, leaving him outmaneuvered and at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience running thin, Percy grabbed a nearby bottle and rose from his seat, thrusting it toward Rylie. &#34;You&#39;d better think before you speak, unless you&#39;re looking for trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass bottle hovered dangerously close to Rylie&#39;s face, prompting uneasy glances from the others.Still, she remained perfectly still, her calm and unwavering stare radiating a quiet, unsettling strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to forget I am your cousin, Percy. Treating your family like this truly isn&#39;t what an Owen would do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every second under Rylie&#39;s gaze, Percy&#39;s nerves twisted in knots, yet his humiliation only made his temper flare hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before things escalated, one of his friends stepped in, gently urging Percy to set the bottle down and return to his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Rylie swept her eyes across the cluttered table. &#34;So, what&#39;s everyone playing tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone answered from across the table, &#34;It&#39;s beer pong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea seemed to spark something in Percy.&#34;You&#39;ve probably played before at school,haven&#39;t you,Rylie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she hadn&#39;t joined in herself, Rylie understood the game&#39;s basics. &#34;You called me here just for a drinking game? Is this really how you spend your time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet again, Rylie managed to turn the conversation back on him, her words stinging sharper than before.Percy forced a laugh, frustration showing, &#34;Actually,I&#39;ve got plenty on my plate. I&#39;m studying for the Navy enlistment exam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a raised brow and an unimpressed look, Rylie eyed Percy up and down before letting out a sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You thínk so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab couldn&#39;t have been more obvious. Tapping his own chest, Percy replied, &#34;That&#39;s right. I finished third in a world-famous hacking competition. The Navy could use someone like me. Even Brad had good things to say. You really think everyone from the Owen family is as worthless as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden laugh burst from Rylie. &#34;Are you talking about that contest? The trophy meant nothing, just some plastic hype. Brad was only trying to be polite because he&#39;s older than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, her entry into the competition was out of sheer boredom, and the system&#39;s weak security made it laughably easy- Britton could have taken first without breaking a sweat. No one could say Percy had real talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy&#39;s patience had clearly reached its limit. &#34;You think you&#39;re better than me? What do you even know,being a woman and all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tossed another ping pong ball into a c up.&#34;Maybe I don&#39;t know everything, but I&#39;m certain I canFrom the corner, one of the rich guys let out a low whistle and said, &#34;Come on, Rylie, even we can&#39;t win against Percy at this. Don&#39;t set yourself up to lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk played on Rylie&#39;s lips. &#34;So, are we playing or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement lit up Percy&#39;s face, but he was in no rush to make it easy for her. He gave a discreet signal, and a glamorous woman at his side chimed in, &#34;What&#39;s the fun in just drinking? Why not clear out the other side&#39;s cups and add a little dare for whoever loses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy, not missing a beat, raised the stakes. &#34;Alright,if you lose, Rylie, you&#39;ve got to do a strip tease right here on the pole. Deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer was a calm smile. &#34;Fine, but if you&#39;re the one who loses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confident to the point of arrogance, Percy replied,&#34;That&#39;s not going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s grin only widened.,if you end up losing,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you&#39;ll be the one stripping and putting on a show for everyone,okay?&#34;</p>
