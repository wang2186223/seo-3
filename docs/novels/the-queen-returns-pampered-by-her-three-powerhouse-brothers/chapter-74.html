                <p>Brad had always been known for his honesty, especially when the matter was serious. Deandre, though initially skeptical, was beginning to come around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie motioned for Deandre to follow her to the bench. The surface was covered in her tightly packed notes,all carefully arranged and easy to follow. She handed them over without hesitation. &#34;These are the details of my experiments. Go ahead and look through them. Ask me if anything&#39;s unclear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the stack a nod before finally taking it. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll read them later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad glanced at the clock. &#34;It&#39;s getting late. Let&#39;s go grab something to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Deandre answered, &#34;We&#39;ll eat when we get home.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad reminded him, &#34;The drive from here to the Serenity Manor takes two hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie agreed that the commute wasn&#39;t ideal. She also had plans to stop by HaloFlow Pharmacy that afternoon. &#34;There are plenty of places to eat nearby,&#34; she said. &#34;Let&#39;s just have lunch here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre let out a reluctant breath. &#34;Fine. What do you feel like eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, Brad offered a suggestion. &#34;There&#39;s a new steakhouse around the corner. Nice setting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>go there,&#34; said Rylie with a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped outside first and stopped short when she nearly bumped into someone standing frozen near the entrance. Stacey looked tired, her face drawn, her eyes fixed on the lab sign. She blinked at the sight of Rylie and asked without thinking, &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lifted an eyebrow. &#34;The lab&#39;s been assigned to me. I&#39;m running experiments. Why wouldn&#39;t I be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey stared at her, unable to look away. Under the morning sun, Rylie looked far too composed,her presence more striking than ever. Envy burned hot behind Stacey&#39;s clenched fists. The same girl she had tried to erase. The same girl who had lived under her shadow for years. And now, that girl was flourishing after leaving the Kirk name behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own life, meanwhile, had unraveled. Fred had broken off their engagement. Gossip clung to her wherever she went. Her brothers had grown colder with each passing day. Things were only getting worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had meant to lash out, to throw an insult and maybe regain a sliver of pride. But before she could open her mouth, something else caught her eye. Two men stepped out of the lab behind Rylie. Both tall. Both unmistakable. Stacey recognized them right away. Names she had memorized. Faces she had daydreamed about. They were the kind of men she&#39;d always hoped to meet in another life, the kind who lived in the world she had always chased but never reached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And suddenly, her plan changed. She dropped to her knees and clutched Rylie&#39;s pant leg. Her voice cracked as she cried, &#34;Rylie, I&#39;m begging you. I&#39;m kneeling. Please help our mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outburst didn&#39;t go unnoticed. Several students nearby stopped walking and turned to stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad and Deandre came up behind, and Deandre frowned at the sight. &#34;What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rylie could answer, Stacey interrupted, tears streaking her cheeks. &#34;Nicolas is dying, and Mom can&#39;t even stand today. I know you think you&#39;re better than us now, but they raised you for years. Please. Just come see them. Help them one last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she twisted the moment, casting Rylie as heartless in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers rippled through the crowd of students nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her tone even.parents live in the countryside and work the fields. Stacey, what exactly are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey turned toward Deandre, her expression full of disbelief. Rylie&#39;s response made no sense. She had clearly returned to the Owen family and even had such influential brothers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop pretending. You&#39;re with the Owen family,&#34; Stacey insisted, her tears spilling again &#34;I&#39;m not after money. I just want you to help our Mom and brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie slowly lowered herself to meet hereye. &#34;What nonsense is that? My parents are farmers. Who started this ridiculous rumor about me becoming wealthy?&#34; She glanced away briefly. &#34;The Kirk family already kicked me out. It made the news. You all cutties with me. Now you want me to come back? For what? And &#39;Our&#39; Mom and brother? Sorry, they&#39;re yours, not mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey panicked and blurted, &#34;You&#39;re the reason Nicolas and Mom started getting better. You used your</p>
                
                
                
                <p>own medicine. If you refuse now, they will die because of you! How heartless you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stared at her, blinking once. &#34;What medicine? I don&#39;t even have a license. I&#39;m still in school. I can&#39;t treat anyone legally.Where are you getting these stories?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The students around them began talking in hushed voices again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows the Kirk family turned her away. They even made it public. Now Stacey&#39;s groveling in front of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is she even asking Rylie? Leland is the doctor in the family. He should be the one helping, not a student.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, who hadn&#39;t spoken yet, finally joined the conversation. &#34;Leland might not be able to help either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire group turned toward him, watching closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey felt her stomach twist. Brad didn&#39;t rush. &#34;Leland was arrested for medical fraud and organ trafficking. He&#39;s already in custody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color was drained from Stacey&#39;s face. &#34;You&#39;re lying. What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had known Leland was missing for days, but the police hadn&#39;t revealed anything. The family still didn&#39;t know what the charges were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s smile was faint but firm. &#34;You&#39;ll know the truth by tonight. It&#39;ll be on the news.&#34;</p>
