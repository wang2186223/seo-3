                <p>Percy gave a firm nod and said, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers exploded from the crowd, drawing glances from every corner of the bar and sending the energy surging through the room like a spark on dry timber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the noise made its way to the suite on the upper floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the VIP room, a man in a dark suit lounged on a sofa. He held an unlit cigar but waved off the lighter offered by the man kneeling beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t smoke anymore. What&#39;s all that fuss outside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just some kids getting overexcited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronan Boyd leaned closer, holding out a lighter with a nervous smile. &#34;I know your health isn&#39;t great.I wouldn&#39;t have dragged you to such a smoky mess if it weren&#39;t important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad ignored the lighter and turned it over in his hand. &#34;The mayor&#39;s secretary got arrested this morning.Same with the Wilde family. Tell me, Ronan -how deep are you in this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear | wasn&#39;t part of their organ trafficking. I do have lines I don&#39;t cross,&#34; said Ronan, trying to sound steady. &#34;But now they&#39;re trying to frame me. If that sticks, I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad spoke coolly. &#34;I&#39;m in the military. I don&#39;t cover for criminals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronan quickly added, &#34;Of course, I understand. But you know this bar is just a side business. It&#39;s to maintain relationships with big clients who buy medical equipment. I assure you, my dealings in medical devices are entirely legitimate. I wouldn&#39;t risk anything else, especially when the equipment for your fleet alone is profitable enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad stared hard at him, eyes sharp enough to see through walls. Ronan gulped and lifted a trembling hand. &#34;I promise I&#39;ve done nothing shady. This is a setup. The Wilde family tried to interfere with the fleet&#39;s health systems, and I reported them. You know l&#39;ve always been straight with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t speak for a beat. Then he slowly raised his hand. &#34;I get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronan felt the air return to his lungs. That gesture was all the reassurance he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the noise grew louder. Ronan frowned and turned toward the door. He waved at the waiter.&#34;Go check what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s bothering my guest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter stepped closer and explained, &#34;Mr.Percy Garrett is playing games with his cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronan scoffed, visibly annoyed, &#34;I don&#39;t care who they are. Go down and tell them to keep it quiet.Drinks are free tonight, but don&#39;t let them disturb us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the waiter could leave, Brad stood up. He smoothed his suit and said calmly, &#34;No need. I&#39;ll take a look myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ronan blinked in surprise. He didn&#39;t expect Brad to care about whatever nonsense the rich kids were doing, but he said nothing. He bowed slightly and trailed after Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s really nothing of value going on down there,&#34; Ronan mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the lower level, Percy&#39;s group had already gathered. Some were whistling, others had their phones up to record the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lights in the bar flickered, throwing dim shadows across Rylie&#39;s steady face. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and slowly scanned the glasses lined up on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You first.&#34; Percy pushed the balls in her direction,the motion almost daring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Rylie let out a soft chuckle. She grabbed a ball, tossed it without aiming, and watched it arc cleanly into the farthest glass. A small splash followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd let out a loud cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy&#39;s face shifted for a moment, but he caught himself and said, &#34;Not bad luck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his shot next. After a brief pause, he squinted, aimed, and let the ball fly. It barely cleared the rim before dropping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This pace is too slow,&#34; said Rylie. &#34;Can I toss two at a time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some in the crowd exchanged doubtful glances.They knew the odds were tougher that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Percy smirked and agreed, &#34;Fine. Just don&#39;t cry about it when you lose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie picked up two balls and sent themn flying. They dropped cleanly into two glasses. Percy tried to pass it off as sheer luck. But that excuse wore thin. One after another, she knocked out half his glasses without missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his next turn, Percy misjudged the throw. The ball skipped the rim and hit the floor. He started to sweat and tapped his fingers against the table,restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie leaned her chin on her hand. Her smile was faint but unmistakably smug. &#34;Nervous already Percy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened. &#34;Don&#39;t get cocky.&#34; He rose abruptly, leaned forward, and tossed the ball again.This time, it sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a breath and glanced at her. &#34;You&#39;re up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nonchalantly picked up three balls, not even glancing at the table, and tossed them at once. The balls spun in the air and landed steadily in Percy&#39;s last three glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence swept the room.</p>
