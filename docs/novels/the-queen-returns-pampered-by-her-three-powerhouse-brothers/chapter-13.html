                <p>Meeting Stacey&#39;s gaze, Rylie raised an eyebrow provocatively. &#34;You&#39;re not backing out now, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden unease twisted within Stacey, as though Rylie had become an unreadable stranger. Still, she answered softly, &#34;If that&#39;s what it takes to reassure you, I&#39;m fine going through with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With cold detachment, Leland interjected, &#34;Let&#39;s see what kind of score you can achieve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Rylie seated herself, she lifted her pen calmly,feeling everyone&#39;s stares lock onto her every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean clicked his stopwatch, while Leland hovered close, his lips curved in scorn as he scanned the test. The complexity of the exam even puzzled him; if Rylie answered a single question correctly, it  would be nothing short of a wonder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Stacey peeked at the questions and found herself completely baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to be concerned, she prompted a gentle plea. &#34;Rylie, take it easy. We trust you; don&#39;t push yourself unnecessarily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland scoffed harshly, &#34;She&#39;s just too stubborn to admit the truth. This will finally prove she&#39;s a fraud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anticipation filled the room, each person awaiting Rylie&#39;s inevitable failure. But the atmosphere shifted subtly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean and the teacher began scrutinizing Rylie&#39;s answers, their expressions gradually shifting from skepticism to surprise. Stacey, always attuned to subtle shifts, sensed something unusual and tried to distract Rylie again. &#34;Look, Rylie, Fred wasn&#39;t someone I wanted to steal from you. There&#39;s no reason for resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyed by Rylie&#39;s lack of response, Leland  snapped, &#34;Don&#39;t ignore Stacey. Didn&#39;t anyone teach you basic manners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie raised her eyes calmly. &#34;You seem to be the one lacking basic manners. Are you blind? I&#39;m busy here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As if it&#39;ll matter,&#34; Leland retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical dean interjected firmly, &#34;Stacey, please hold your comments until after Rylie finishes. There&#39;s no reason to interrupt prematurely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey recoiled slightly, fists tightening at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere thought of Rylie surpassing her filled Stacey with dread - she couldn&#39;t·allow such humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, time ran out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dean, principal, and teacher clustered around Rylie&#39;s paper, passing it back and forth, their whispers intense and astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s voice dripped disdain, saying, Her handwriting is barely readable, and her reasoning is muddled. Don&#39;t strain yourselves trying to decipher nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On the contrary,&#34; the dean announced enthusiastically, &#34;Rylie has exceeded expectations.Her answers aren&#39;t just correct; they&#39;re superior to our model solutions. Honestly, even I would have struggled to score this highly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smirk played at Rylie&#39;s lips as she watched Stacey and Leland frantically seize the paper, shock rendering them speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far from illegible, Rylie&#39;s writing flowed elegantly across the page, each answer brilliant and clear.Leland was dumbfounded. How had she become this talented without their notice? Wasn&#39;t she supposed to be shallow and unremarkable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey stood frozen, envy surging inside her. When exactly had Rylie grown so incredibly strong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing that he had been misled, the principal coughed awkwardly, &#34;It&#39;s clear now.Rylie earned her perfect score honestly. We owe her an apology and a cleared reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those who&#39;ve wronged Rylie should apologize openly,&#34; the dean added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately switching tone, Stacey exclaimed with forced admiration, &#34;Rylie, you&#39;re unbelievable! You&#39;ve obviously been studying in secret; no wonder you&#39;ve excelled. And surely you understand that Leland showed up today because he was eager to help you clear your name. You can see how genuinely he cares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland cut in sharply, &#34;Enough. Rylie&#39;s beyond understanding simple sentiments like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Is Leland really that kind?&#34; Rylie retorted scornfully.&#34;Spare me the excuses. Just apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward Fred, Rylie warned him gently, &#34;Don&#39;t forget about honoring your bet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s face flushed with anger.&#34;You tricked us, Rylie.Secretly studying to embarrass us and letting everyone believe you were a cheat - what an underhanded move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to remain silent, the dean interjected firmly,&#34;Mr. Kirk, you&#39;re unfairly partial towards Stacey.Why do you overlook Rylie&#39;s clear and exceptional abilities?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland bristled with unease yet remained defiant.&#34;I&#39;ve treated them equally. The problem here lies with Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With calm authority, Rylie instructed, &#34;Enough excuses. Just apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back tears, Stacey pleaded earnestly, &#34;Rylie,forgive me. I&#39;m entirely responsible. Blame me if you must, but please don&#39;t hold this against Leland. I&#39;m truly sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to bear her shame, Stacey turned and fled,sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See what you&#39;ve done?&#34; Leland snapped at Rylie before running after Stacey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred wanted to go and comfort Stacey, but two  imposing men entered abruptly, seizing his shoulders. One sneered coldly, &#34;Who gave you permission to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred flinched in shock. &#34;Who the hell are you? What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without his military attire, Brock firmly hauled Fred outside to the crowded sports field, assisted by his companion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock forced Fred to his knees with a swift kick, then mockingly patted his cheek. &#34;It&#39;s time to keep your promise, Mr. Dury. Crawl on the ground and apologize to Miss Kirk for everyone to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just a joke!&#34; Fred blurted, his face crimson with embarrassment. He deeply regretted leaving his bodyguards at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously. &#34;Just a joke,huh? Wouldn&#39;t you have demanded Miss Kirk crawl and apologize if she had failed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred hesitated for a moment. As a trained military  interrogator, Brock was certain that Fred would have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock wouldn&#39;t tolerate humiliation toward Rylie,especially since she had once saved the general&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened confidently, towering above Fred.&#34;You&#39;d better honor your bet, or your family&#39;s wealth will vanish overnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred twisted his face in defiance. &#34;And who exactly are you to threaten my family? You can&#39;t ruin us with just a few words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock smiled ominously. &#34;The general mentioned your family&#39;s stock has been teetering lately.if you&#39;d prefer swift ruin, he can arrange that by evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all of Crolens, Fred couldn&#39;t recall another influential family besides the Morgan family who had a high-ranking general. His eyes widened with anxiety; he wouldn&#39;t risk the Durys&#39; future on a bluff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had someone as insignificant as Rylie gained support from the Morgans, strong enough to humiliate him publicly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to defy the situation, Fred reluctantly crawled on the ground and shouted, &#34;Rylie, I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock sneered, nudging him harder, &#34;Louder!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s reluctant shout filled the sports field, reaching Stacey&#39;s ears from a distance. Witnessing his humiliation, she felt her heart torn apart, tears streaming unchecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struggled to understand how Rylie, who appeared to have lost everything, could emforce such disgrace upon Fred. Did he do this willinglly? Did he still secretly care for Rylie, even to this degrading extent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, Stacey angrily stormed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing everything quietly, Rylie felt detached from Fred&#39;s disgrace. Leaving the scene, she approached a sleek luxury car parked nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d noticed it earlier upon entering the campuS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, she leaned forward, tapping gently on the window. &#34;Mr. Morgan, was it you behind all this?&#34;</p>
