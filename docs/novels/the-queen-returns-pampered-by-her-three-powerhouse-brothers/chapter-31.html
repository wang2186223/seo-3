                <p>Across the track, Rylle pulled out her earbuds and walked straight toward her car-Black Mirage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle had been sitting untouched in Britton&#39;s garage. Now, for this race, he&#39;d finally rolled it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t touched the engine,&#34; Britton said. &#34;It&#39;s still running exactly how you funed it last time.&#34; He gave a nod toward the new paint job. &#34;Only thing I changed was the color. Looks sharp, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave the car a once-over. Satisfied, she climbed in. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her car reached the starting line, the crowd began to murmur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That design... Doesn&#39;t it look like one of Revline&#39;s builds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Revline hasn&#39;t worked on a car in years. And this driver- she&#39;s a woman. That&#39;s rare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip spotted the car, and his face went tight. &#34;How is this possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone familiar with racing cars knew that Revline&#39;s creations were rare. Their speed, their handling,the cost-nothing matched them. These machines sold for hundreds of millions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Rylie really had one, then Phillip had no idea how the race would turn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she connected to Revline? Why hadn&#39;t he ever heard of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the questions had to wait. The fifth racer was already in view. His two sisters, Stacey and Rylie,were about to go head-to-head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey gripped the wheel so tightly that her knuckles turned pale. Her car gave a slight shake,not from the weather, but from her hands trembling on the controls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three. Two. One! Go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both engines roared to life. Stacey&#39;s pink custom slipped on the wet track. The tires spun out briefly before they found grip. Meanwhile, Rylie&#39;s Black Mirage blasted forward, slicing through the rain and grabbing half a car-length lead in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip shouted from the sidelines, &#34;No turbo lag? Are you kidding me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t been told that Rylie had already removed the speed limiter from her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the first tur, Stacey dropped into third. Phillip clenched his fists and yelled, &#34;Stacey! What are you waiting for? Step on it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey tensed up the moment Phillip yelled. She saw Rylie pulling ahead, clenched her jaw, and slammed the gas pedal down hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disable the limniter! Rylie&#39;s the only one in your way- overtake her now!&#34; shouted Phillip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed the command and switched off the limiter. Her car responded instantly, gaining speed in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It surged forward and pulled alongside Rylie&#39;s vehicle. She glanced over, the adrenaline kicking in. Her competitive side roared to life. The turbines screamed as she pushed past Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice move, Stacey!&#34; came Phillip&#39;s voice in her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t react. The lead didn&#39;t bother her. She had already noticed the drop in visibility.Hail had begun to fall. At their current speed, a single mistake could be costly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,hail peted Stacey&#39;s windshield. Her breath caught in her throat. She blinked fast, trying to see through the storm. In the mirror, she caught a glimpse of Rylie&#39;s car. It clung to the inside line, one wheel barely touching the ground, slicing close to the guardrail. She could tell that Rylie was going for the overtake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey immediately activated the mechanical button to prepare for another speed boost, but Phillip&#39;s warning came through her headset. &#34;Your tires are worn from the high speed, and the cornering isn&#39;t great. Don&#39;t go too fast; just keep Rylie behind you and get through steadily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t!&#34; shouted Stacey. &#34;She&#39;s going wide on the turn, and I have to stay at this speed to make it through!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reckless thought surged through her mind. There were no barriers on this stretch. Just one small nudge at the edge could send Rylie&#39;s car flying off the cliff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Rylie crashed, every problem would disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie noticed what was happening. She saw the angle, the pressure, and the space narrowing.But she didn&#39;t flinch. She pressed the lever forward and floored the gas, preparing to take the bend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she insane?!&#34; the commentator yelled. &#34;That corner took out three racers last year! She&#39;s actually going for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey saw her shot and hit the brakes. The lights on her car flashed bright. In the pit, Britton&#39;s heart nearly stopped.&#34;Boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s eyes burned with something wild. &#34;Die, Rylie,&#34; she muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the VIP room, Brad sat motionless. His fists clenched in his lap. His face had gone cold and hard as ice.</p>
