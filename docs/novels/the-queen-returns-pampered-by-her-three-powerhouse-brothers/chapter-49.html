                <p>Rylie checked the time. &#34;Only thirty minutes left, and you&#39;re just telling me now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s voice came through the line, soft and apologetic. &#34;I&#39;m really sorry. I was up all night working on the music.I must&#39;ve dozed off while getting ready I can send a driver right now if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A male voice broke in from the background. &#34;Why do you keep saying sorry to her? Does she think being part of the Owen family makes her better than everyone else? She spent time in some forgotten town and now walks around like she owns you. What kind of attitude is that?&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Rylie ended the call. So that was the plan? They wanted to make her show up late and look ridiculous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another moment, she dialed a different number The line rang twice before a deep voice answered, &#34;Miss Owen, or should|say, Dr.Owen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just call me Rylie,&#34; she said. &#34;I need your help.Mind if I borrow the helicopter? I&#39;ll subtract it from your next bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad hadn&#39;t expected to hear from her. He glanced down, fingers toying with the model warship on his desk. &#34;Another emergency?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to be at the Darkwell charity gala,&#34; she said plainly. &#34;Can you manage it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad straightened his cuff and smiled faintly. &#34;Funny you called. I&#39;m heading there myself. Why don&#39;t we go together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, Brad turned to Brock, who was standing nearby. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say it&#39;s a charity event?We shouldn&#39;t skip something like that. Make the preparations. We&#39;re going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock stood frozen for a second. Just earlier, Brad insisted that he wasn&#39;t going. Now, after that phone call, everything changed? Wasn&#39;t this the same man who was supposed to be on medical leave?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he left to get things ready, Brock couldn&#39;t help but mutter under his breath. It turned out that even a man like Brad wasn&#39;t immune to flipping his decisions,especially when a woman like Rylie was involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stepped onto the lawn, her evening gown trailing behind her as the roar of a helicopter sliced through the air. Wind whipped around her legs, tugging at the hem of her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her hand to block the breeze, her hair lifting in soft waves from the downwash. The aircraft settled above the grass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the cabin door swunng open, Brad stood in the doorway, dressed in a sharp black suit. He waited with one hand extended, his stance calm and assured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his lips. His voice carried with ease. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she placed her hand in his. His fingers wrapped around hers, steady and sure, guiding her inside the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was seated, he let go of her hand with quiet politeness and leaned slightly toward her. &#34;You&#39;re heading to the charity gala. Didn&#39;t your staff warn you about the time? | figured your brothers would&#39;ve sent a driver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve got a car,&#34; she said. &#34;But Paola insisted on going together, so I waited.&#34; Her eyes cooled. A wry tone crept into her voice. &#34;She stayed up all night writing music and passed out at the salon. No time to pick me up. If I&#39;d driven to Darkwell myself, l&#39;d have arrived even later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s gaze lingered. He took in her appearance for a brief moment before speaking with calm precision.&#34;Given your background, it makes sense. You&#39;re a direct descendant of the esteemed Owen family,with your grandfather&#39;s business empire stretching across continents and your brothers predominantly based overseas. Most of your brothers operate overseas.That leaves your uncle, Terrance Owen, to manage the branch in Crolens. It&#39;s no surprise someone like Paola tries to take advantage while you&#39;re here.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied him, amused. &#34;You know quite a bit about my family. I thought you spent most of your time at sea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a soft laugh. &#34;Everyone has their sources.Or a network of their own. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words held a deeper meaning, and Rylie didn&#39;t refute it, understanding that he was explaining the Owen family&#39;s complex network for her benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much of the Owen assets sit under that branch?&#34;she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just the territory in Crolens, with little overseas business,&#34; Brad replied coolly. &#34;Not worth worrying about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded and said, &#34;As long as they don&#39;t provoke me, I won&#39;t take action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The helicopter began to descend. Moments later, it touched down on the helipad near the Darkwell venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event had just started. As she stepped out, Brad remained behind. He had his own entrance, one that kept him away from public eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie chose not to walk in with Brad. Just before they went their separate ways, she gave a small smile and said, &#34;Looks like there&#39;ll be a bit of a performance tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad smiled faintly. &#34;I&#39;ll be watching,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the venue, Paola sat among a cluster of well-dressed young women. Now and then, their gazes drifted toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella leaned in and murmured, &#34;Is she too scared to show her face? Maybe she&#39;s worried she&#39;ll embarrass herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola gave a quick shake of her head. With Johnny Reid sitting nearby, she couldn&#39;t risk agreeing out loud Instead, she took a softer approach. &#34;It makes sense for Rylie to be nervous. This is her first time at such a high-profile event. I really should&#39;ve gone to fetch her myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny reached for her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. &#34;You&#39;ve already done so much. You&#39;re thoughtful, even when you&#39;re tired.&#34; He looked toward the door. &#34;If Rylie has any sense, she&#39;ll stay away. With you here, the Owen family&#39;s already well represented.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola dropped her gaze, cheeks tinged pink.&#34;I&#39;m nothing special. There&#39;s no real difference between the two of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their conversation faded, the main doors opened with a hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two staff members gave a courteous nod and announced, &#34;Miss Owen has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her first public appearance since returning to the Owen family. Naturally, every head turned in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s expression changed instantly. Her eyes widened with anticipation, tinged with glee at the thought of Rylie being humiliated. The corners of her lips lifted as she whispered with giddy disbelief, &#34;She actually came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just then...</p>
