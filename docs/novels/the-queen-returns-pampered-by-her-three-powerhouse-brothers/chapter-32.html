                <p>Stacey wanted Rylie gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie only smirked. The in-car camera caught her expression, calm and fearless. Without hesitation, she took her left hand off the wheel and flipped a switch on the center console.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two sharp rows of ice spikes snapped out from under the chassis, stabbing deep into the road. The car clung to the turn like it was glued to the curve, barely missing Stacey&#39;s bumper by inches. Rylie slid past her with poerfect control and took the lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just behind her-Stacey&#39;s car suddenly skidded at the same spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The high-end stabilizing system failed under the pressure of the hail. Her car spun hard, rotating like a toy top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No!&#34; she yelled, slamming the brakes, but it only made things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vehicle slipped sideways toward the edge. Her rear tires lifted, hanging over nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the last second, a rescue hook fired from beneath the track and snagged her car by the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Phillip&#39;s Team Car No.6-rescue complete! The race continues!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd jumped to their feet. &#34;Unbelievable save!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s car shot down the track like a bullet and vanished into the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the pit, Phillip stared at the monitor. He didn&#39;t move. He didn&#39;t speak. Just one thought ran through his head-it was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Rylie was fifteen seconds ahead. But the real threat hadn&#39;t hit yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brutal crosswind tore across the peak of the mountain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss! Wind speeds have passed the safety threshold!&#34; Britton called through the communicator.&#34;You should ease off-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shuti.&#34; Rylie cut the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her car pushed through the wind like à missile. The tachometer was already deep in the red. The engine roared, ready to blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up ahead,something worse appeared. A jagged crack split open across the track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commentator&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;Theroad&#39;s breaking apart from the cold! Officials justissued a red flag waming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t ease up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifty yards before the crack, Rylie yanked the steering wheel upward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car lifted off the ground. With the help of the crosswind, it cleared a full 200 yards through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All four shock absorbers blew out on impact, but she gripped the wheel tight and kept control without a hitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd broke into roaring applause. The commentator, watching the clock, shouted, &#34;If Britton&#39;s team sets a record tonight, it&#39;s all because of No. 6! She&#39;s tearing down the track like a rocket! Let&#39;s hope she makes it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fantastic!&#34; said Brock, flashing a fist pump. He turned to Brad, who never took his eyes off the screen.&#34;Dr. Kirk&#39;s skills are on another level.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s tense expression softened. His gaze followed the car with pride. He stood. &#34;Let&#39;s go meet her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Rylie crossed the finish line cleanly, Stacey&#39;s car was just being hauled back onto the track. The final times appeared on screen. For Phillip&#39;s team, it was painful to see-one minute and twenty-eight seconds behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a gap; it was a chasm!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commentator&#39;s voice took on a somber tone. &#34;Who would&#39;ve guessed the defending champions would drop all the way to eighth? A single mistake by No. 6, and their title slipped away. Tough break for the team.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the pit, Stacey returned with her head down. She didn&#39;t dare look at anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip stormed up, yanked the car door open, and dragged her out. &#34;I fold you to ease off! Are you brainless? You kept pushing it through that curve and then hit the brakes? Didn&#39;t I explain the tire wear situation to you clearly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey hadn&#39;t expected him to snap in front of the whole crowd. Her cheeks burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l just... I just didn&#39;t want Rylie to pass me. I thought I could hold the line! You&#39;re the one who didn&#39;t check the tires properly. That&#39;s why l lost control out there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s face turned red. &#34;You&#39;re blaming me? After all this time, you&#39;re still driving like an amateur!You&#39;re the reason we lost!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey&#39;s anger flared. She shoved him back and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the stands, soda bottles flew. The crowd shouted insults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People had bet big. Phillip&#39;s team had always been the favorite. For years, they held the top spot. This time, expectations had turned into outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that they weren&#39;t even in the top three, fans who lost money turned furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bottle hit Jake square on the head. He stood up, furious. &#34;This whole race was a setup! Someone from our side gave Britton&#39;s team everything - our strategies, our driving habits! That&#39;s the only reason they won. There&#39;s no other explanation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m reporting this! This isn&#39;t fair!&#34; Phillip, still seething, took Jake&#39;s words to heart. The idea struck him fast. Maybe he could get Rylie&#39;s results thrown out by the committee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the commotion, fans started shouting too. They now demanded an investigation.</p>
