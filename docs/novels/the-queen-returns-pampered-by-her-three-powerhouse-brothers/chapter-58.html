                <p>Word of the commotion at the gate had already made its way indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock stepped out, calm and firm, his presence drawing the crowd&#39;s attention. They greeted him with practiced smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of them had met Brad, but they all knew Brock well. He rarely left Brad&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Brock paid them no mind. His expression stayed cold-until he caught sight of Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Miss Owen. Have you had anything to eat?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie handed him her sun hat without ceremony and said, &#34;I did. I just came from my morning run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock accepted the hat and smiled. &#34;I was out running myself. Come, I&#39;ll walk you to the seminar hall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a nod. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd stared, unsure of what they were seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Morgan family had a reputation built on military discipline and cool reserve. Their bodyguards came from top units. Brock, especially, was known for keeping close to Brad and speaking to few. So watching him treat a young woman like a close friend caught everyone off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita and her family had tried to make Rylie feel unwelcome. Yet Brock&#39;s gesture flipped the situation.Now it looked as if Rylie were a special guest at the Morgan estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita gritted her teeth. &#34;What is going on? Why would the Morgans be kind to someone like her? Her reputation is awful. Have they lost their minds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha leaned closer and whispered, &#34;Grandma,we&#39;re still on Morgan land.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita bit back her reaction. Timothy couldn&#39;t hold his  in. He pointed at Rylie, raising his voice. &#34;Are the security guards all asleep? She&#39;s a fraud! Her mentor caused a death, remember!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards stepped forward. &#34;Sir. Put your hand down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timothy, already bitter from losing his research funding, could hardly contain his rage. He didn&#39;t care who was listening. &#34;You let people like this in, and now you can&#39;t even-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard didn&#39;t let him finish. In one swift move,he grabbed Timothy&#39;s wrist, twisted it, and shoved him back. His voice rang out, low and stern. &#34;This is Morgan ground. We do not allow disruption. The Morgans decide what is just.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That plain-looking guard suddenly stood like a soldier, his presence silencing the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that he was about to be escorted out,Timothy stumbled and reached for Evita&#39;s sleeve.&#34;Aunt Evita! Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita jerked her arm away. &#34;How many times have l warned you not to act like this? You never listen.I can&#39;t help you anymore. From now on, deal with the consequences yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Timothy&#39;s face twisted in panic. &#34;No! I know | was wrong! Please, Aunt Evita, don&#39;t abandon me! I was only trying to help you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he knew the truth. If the Wilde family turned its back on him, everything would be lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was too late now. His expulsion sent a clear message to everyone else, and they slipped into the Morgan estate in uneasy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita stood still, her chest tight with worry. Timothy was his nephew after all. Watching the Morgans treat himn like that felt like a direct insult. But she couldn&#39;t afford to speak up. With Aetheris Pharmacy&#39;s online ban hanging over them, their influence had already grown thin. She had no choice. Today, she needed to take the lead as Brad&#39;s attending physician if she hoped to keep her family in the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached the estate entrance with Marsha and Yosef, a guard stepped in their way.&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he said. &#34;The invitation allows only one assistant per attending physician.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita&#39;s lips twitched. NJot again. This day was already bad enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha turned toward her, the edge of hesitation in her voice. &#34;Grandma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita tightened her grip around Marsha&#39;s fingers.&#34;Yosef, wait outside. Marsha&#39;s coming with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef said nothing. He wasn&#39;t pleased, but he knew better than to argue at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha quietly exhaled. Relief washed over her. She knew that her grandmother had no plans of letting her stay behind. They were there for more than Brad&#39;s treatment. Making an impression on him was just as important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the estate&#39;s elegant reception room, the air was calm but thick with whispers. The walls held old scrolls and calligraphy, the kind passed through generations. Even the teacups had the look of heirlooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time a well-known doctor stepped in, a butler announced their name for all to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie walked in right on time. When the words &#34;HaloFlow Pharmacy&#34; rang out, heads turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glances weren&#39;t open stares, but the message behind them came through clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one welcomed her. The other doctors stayed just far enough to make their disapproval known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she wasn&#39;t alone. Rory noticed the stares and understood her choice to stay quiet. He said nothing.He simply took the seat next to her and sat close, a silent sign of support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a man&#39;s voice came from the side,calm but laced with surprise. &#34;Rylie.&#34;</p>
