                <p>Rylie went along with Johnny as he returned to the Reid estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manor stood by the bay, built completely from white marble. Sapphire mosaics stretched across the domed ceilings, creating ripples like waves frozen in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stepped into the main hall, the chandelier above scattered light in every direction. The reflection danced across the walls, giving the room the look of a palace beneath the sea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paintings lined the hall,each one showing a different cargo ship once owned by the Reid family. Every canvas told a piece of their long-standing maritime legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandmother&#39;s waiting in the treasure room,&#34; said Johnny as he walked beside her down a qquiet corridor.Past the windows, a row of private yachts shimmered in the moonlight, docked neatly just beyond the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside that room, an older woman with silver hair let out a quiet sigh as she stared at a locked safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she noticed Rylie, her dull gaze turned clear. &#34;Is this the girl who pointed out the Buckley heirloom was fake? Please, sit down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie returned the greeting politely, though something inside the safe had caught her eye. Inside sat a set of jewelry, old and valuable. At the center was a rare ruby, its deep red glow pulsing under the light like a heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the one,&#34; she murmured. Hulda reached inside carefully. &#34;The appraisers said the gem&#39;s cut was too modern. They insisted it was fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie slipped on a pair of gloves and grabbed a magnifying glass. She leaned in, studying every line and angle. Her finger drifted over the stone&#39;s surface and stopped where the edge dipped slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t fake,&#34; she said without hesitation. &#34;It&#39;s genuine. And it&#39;s worth a great deal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older woman&#39;s hands shook. Her cup dropped to the floor. &#34;Real? But they were all so sure this is fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They made an error,&#34; said Rylie, lifting the ruby toward the light. &#34;Look here. You&#39;ll see tiny processing marks, but they weren&#39;t made with modern tools.They&#39;re from a lost technique used by the Osmond family. They were famous for restoring art pieces centuries ago. People who don&#39;t know that history will misread it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;The Bocross craftsmen-masters in their time - were the ones who developed this cutting method to bring damaged heirlooms back to life. The knowledge didn&#39;t survive. That&#39;s why modern experts confuse it with forgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she explained, Johnny couldn&#39;t take his eyes off her. Her poise, her mind, the way she moved-all of it held him still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Hulda saw the way her grandson looked at Rylie and immediately understood what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing her explanation, Rylie looked up and asked softly, &#34;Any questions left?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hulda exhaled in relief. &#34;I knew l wasn&#39;t wrong to trust my instincts. This pieceis irreplaceable. But how could someone your age see what even the experts missed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a faint smile. &#34;I read a lot. I&#39;ve also spent years learning about jewelry. That helps. And this kind of piece needs to stay at a steady twenty degrees Celsius. Your vault mixes artifacts that need different storage. It&#39;s safer to keep them apart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could respond, a voice came from the doorway. &#34;Madam, the appraiser from Crolens Museum is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hulda showed a warm smile at Rylie and explained calmly, &#34;Some folks from Okvale Museum said this was a fake. They even offered to discard it for me.I refused. I brought it home, planning to get another opinion from Crolens. My grandson then suggested inviting you too. I hope you won&#39;t take that the wrong way, Miss Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded. &#34;No offense taken. It&#39;s smart to get more than one view.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hulda turned to the servant and asked them to bring the appraiser inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man who entered looked close to eighty,and carried himself like someone who&#39;d spent decades in museum work. His expertise in antique jewelry was evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his time examining the gem under a magnifying glass, speaking quietly with Rylie as he worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he straightened up, his tone certain.&#34;Those folks from Okvale have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This is the real deal. If you ever want to donate it, our museum would be honored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A content smile crossed Hulda&#39;s face. &#34;That was my plan. My grandson will bring it over for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The appraiser then approached Rylie and handed her a card. &#34;Take this. Your insight and knowledge are remarkable. Did you study this in school? We could really use someone like you at the museum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie took the card with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s just a personal interest. My background&#39;s actually in medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man blinked, clearly surprised.&#34;Your generation keeps raising the bar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny carefully stored the jewelry in a protective box and turned toward her. &#34;I&#39;mn heading that way myself. Let me give you a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hulda walked her to the door herself, her grip on Rylie&#39;s hand warm and sincere. &#34;Come by whenever you&#39;d like. If there&#39;s anywhere you wish to visit,just let Johnny know. Our ships can take you anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touched by the gesture, Rylie looked at her and smiled. &#34;Thank you, Mrs. Reid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hulda let go, glanced at Johnny, then watched them go with a quiet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny placed the box securely in the rear seat and started the car. They followed &#39;close behind the museum vehicle as it rolled onto the highway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced to the side, where the sea met the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon had begun to rise, its light dancing on the waves and painting the ocean with a silver glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Rylie in the passenger seat, then reached forward and tapped a button. The roof folded back.Cool wind rushed in and swept through her hair,making her blink against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there anything you&#39;re not good at?&#34; he asked suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie turned her gaze to the sea. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny gave a small laugh. &#34;Medicine. Music.Appraisal. Is there anything you can&#39;t master?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a playful smile. &#34;I just taught myself these things on the side. They&#39;re nothing more than hobbies.I know a little about each, but not enough to call myself an expert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny laughed under his breath, his fingers tapping lightly against the wheel. &#34;Hobbies? Those &#39;pastimes&#39;put seasoned professionals to shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The breeze caught Rylie&#39;s hair. She tucked it behind her ear and glanced at him. &#34;Was that your way of paying me a compliment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just being honest.&#34; Johnny&#39;s eyés narrowed as he looked into the rearview mirror. &#34;That black car&#39;s been behind us for three turns now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie cast a brief glance at the mirror. The SUV was following from a distance that wasn&#39;t too far,but not close enough to seem innocent. She leaned slightly toward him. &#34;Who else knows about the jewelry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only my grandmother. The man from Crolens Museum too. Aside from them...&#34; He tightened his grip on the wheel. &#34;The folks from Okvale Museum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked back toward the mirror. &#34;Okvale? They&#39;ve been in the city for years. Could they be resorting to something like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned sharp as she added, &#34;That&#39;s a professional tail. Pull over. I&#39;ll take it from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny blinked. &#34;I can drive too, you know.Why would I hand over the wheel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie shot back, &#34;Keep arguing, and we&#39;ll lose everything- including that expensive jewelry. Pull over or get robbed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Johnny hit the brakes, the SUV suddenly accelerated toward them! Without missing a beat,Rylie unlatched her seatbelt,vaulted over the console,and shovedhim toward the other seat. &#34;Strap in!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved so fast that he didn&#39;t even realize what had happened until he found himself on the passenger side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A loud crash followed. The SUV rammed into the back of their car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie fixed her gaze on the rearview mirror, her voice low as she commanded, &#34;Get help on the line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny pulled out his phone and dialed quickly,glancing at the back window. &#34;They&#39;re gaining on us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The off-road vehicle jerked to a stop. Four masked men leapt out, metal rods in hand, closing in without a word.</p>
