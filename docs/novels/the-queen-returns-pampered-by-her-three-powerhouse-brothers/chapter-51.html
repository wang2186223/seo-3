                <p>Rylie caught the smugness beneath Paola&#39;s voice but didn&#39;t react. She stayed calm in her seat and looked up at Celia on the stage. &#34;It&#39;s quite a coincidence, but my jewelry isn&#39;t fake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola faltered for a moment, trying to mask the irritation curling in her chest. She forced a smile and said, &#34;Rylie, Miss Buckley&#39;s father owns a jewelry empire. Do you really think she&#39;d fail to tell the difference between real and fake? Save yourself the embarrassment. Just take it off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella let out a laugh. &#34;Paola, don&#39;t waste your breath. Rylie&#39;s too stubborn. She&#39;d rather face Miss Buckley head-on than admit she&#39;s wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia,still onstage, had already noticed the attention circling around Rylie and the matching necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wrapping up her speech, she stepped down carefully, gathering the hem of her dress as she made her way to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the private box above, Brad swirled his wine lazily.Brock leaned closer and murmured, &#34;Dr. Owen&#39;s about to get chewed up. That knockoff necklace looks just  like Celia&#39;s. She&#39;s surrounded by sharks. Should we step in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a dry laugh. &#34;That depends. Who do you think the shark really is right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean to say Dr. Owen&#39;s necklace might be real?&#34;asked Brock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t confirmed anything,&#34; Brad replied, smirking &#34;But she invited me here for entertainment. Let&#39;s just say she never fails to put on a show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia reached the table, lifted her glass, and tapped Johnny&#39;s with a soft clink. &#34;That eigteen-carat red diamond your grandmother likes is among the auction items tonight. Keep an eye on it, or it might disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny nodded and took a sip. &#34;Appreciate the heads -up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Isabella raised her voice. &#34;Miss Buckley,your necklace looks identical to Miss Owen&#39;s. Was there ever a second one made? Isn&#39;t it odd you&#39;re both wearing them tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia turned toward Rylie and gave her a long look.&#34;This necklace is an heirloom. It&#39;s been in my family for three centuries. A queen once owned it. There is only one like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she looked directly at her. &#34;Miss Owen, mind sharing where yours came from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie brought her fingers to the sapphire resting at her collar. &#34;Miss Buckley, are you certain yours is the authentic one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s brows dipped faintly as she answered, steady and sure, &#34;Of course it is. This piece is called &#39;Ocean&#39;s Tear.&#39; It hasn&#39;t left our vault in over three centuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lifted her head, her voice calm yet pointed.&#34;Now that&#39;s interesting. This one, too, came from royal lineage, crafted three hundred years ago using age-old methods. The stones were hand-cut by court jewelers, each one bearing the royal mark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s face wavered for a second, but she laughed lightly and replied, &#34;Miss Owen, imitations these days are surprisingly convincing. Still, the precision and artistry of true heirlooms can&#39;t be copied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola quickly backed her up. &#34;Exactly. Miss Buckley&#39;s necklace has been passed down in her family for generations. It wouldn&#39;t be right to suggest hers is a fake.You should stop acting like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t flinch. She simply turned her necklace around so the back was visible to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we&#39;re talking about craftsmanship, why not let everyone judge for themselves?&#34; Her voice was even,almost too composed. &#34;Genuine royal pieces are marked in secret spots. It helps stop counterfeits from circulating.&#34; She held up the clasp. &#34;This one has &#39;E.V.1732&#39; etched into it. That stands for Edmund Verne, a master jeweler from the royal court.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, several guests leaned closer. When they spotted the engraving, murmurs rippled through the crowd, and some even leaned over to get a better look at Celia&#39;s necklace. Those familiar with antique jewelry began to exchange looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not the same,&#34; whispered someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s hand darted to her own necklace. Her fingers trembled as they brushed against the metal. There was no engraving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t miss a beat. &#34;Also, real royal sapphires produce a velvet-like glow under proper lighting.That glow can&#39;t be copied. It comes from the minerals formed under intense pressure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned just enough for the chandelier&#39;s light to land on the necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, the gems around Rylie&#39;s neck seemed to stir with life, rippling like the sea and glinting like stars scattered across a midnight sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s necklace, by comparison, looked flat. The blue hue was bright, but it lacked any real glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody in the room made a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella went pale. Paola clenched her gown so hard that her nails dug into the fabric. Neither could understand how someone like Rylie, with no high society upbringing and a background in only medicine,could speak so confidently about rare jewels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella snapped, her voice rising, &#34;You&#39;re just making things up! What could you possibly know about jewelry? Miss Buckley has lived among gems since childhood.She wouldn&#39;t be wrong about her own necklace!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola,clearly rattled, tried to hush the situation. &#34;Rylie,stop this nonsense. You know where you are tonight.Apologize to Miss Buckley,now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Rylie didn&#39;t pay any attention to those two troublemakers. Her focus wvas fixed on Celia. &#34;Miss Buckley, would you care to explain why your so-called heirloom has no marking and no velvet shimmer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s breathing picked up, though she held her composure behind a faint smile. &#34;That could be due to how it was stored. A slight change in preservation might explain the difference in appearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that what you believe?&#34; Rylie let out a soft laugh.&#34;That necklace was first auctioned at Wainwright Auction House. It came with full documentation of its history. But it was switched mid-auction by a thief. Its last confirmed sighting was five years ago on the black market overseas. Someone paid a fortune for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused briefly before adding, &#34;Back then,it was valued at one hundred million. If that&#39;s the piece your family bought, then I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve been scammed That&#39;s a very expensive mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Celia&#39;s steps faltered, her color drained. &#34;That&#39;s not true. You&#39;re lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie answered gently, &#34;I wish I were. But it&#39;s the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, the stir around their table had drawn attention from others nearby. Keeping her tone even, Rylie spoke again. &#34;Miss Buckley, will the auction continue as planned, or should we call some experts to take a proper look at both necklaces right here?&#34;</p>
