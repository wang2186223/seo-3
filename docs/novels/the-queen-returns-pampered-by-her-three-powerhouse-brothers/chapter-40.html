                <p>A sharp jolt ran down Fred&#39;s spine. It felt like a cold gust had cut through him. He realized that the situation was spiraling out of control. Sweat began to gather across his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to keep himself steady, though his voice betrayed him. &#34;M-Mr. Cullen, what does Mr. Owen want to discuss with me? Maybe we could talk about this inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair, stone-faced and unreadable, unlocked his tablet and pulled up a file. &#34;In line with the addendum under Article 7, the Owen Group has the right to immediately end ties with any party guilty of misconduct.&#34; He looked up, sharp and direct. His stare struck like a blade. &#34;Mr. Dury, your comments about Miss Kirk already count as a breach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s legs gave way a little. He staggered, nearly falling. He grabbed hold of Casper&#39;s arm, clutching it with such desperation that his nails nearly broke skin &#34;Mr. Kirk! W Rylie really... Is she really...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s lips trembled. But no words came. Fred clung to a small thread of hope. &#34;Couldn&#39;t there be some kind of mistake? Rylie really is... an Owen? My wife picked her up from some remote town. There&#39;s no way she&#39;s tied to that family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair&#39;s voice cut in, laced with scorn. &#34;Are you questioning the Owen family&#39;s credibility? Miss Rylie Kirk was confirmed through DNA. Mr. Kendrick Owen personallyverifiedthat.	she&#39;shis	missing granddaughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper stood frozen. His skin turned a pale shade of grey. &#34;How is this even real...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, the Kirk family not only expelled Rylie but also publicly humiliated her over supposed conduct issues. All of this must have been seen by the Owen family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s knees buckled. He almost couldn&#39;t stay upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This can&#39;t be true! She&#39;s nothing more than a fake the Kirk family has raised for two decades!&#34; Fred shouted.His face twisted in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled to find his phone. &#34;I need to call Mr.Owen right now! This whole thing must be some kind of error!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair let out a low, humorless laugh and nodded at the nearby guards. &#34;Mr. Owen wanted me to make this clear. The Dury family is fully accountable for the emotional damage his sister suffered after the broken engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the tablet again. Fred&#39;s phone buzzed right away.&#34;The Owen Group is canceling the entire three -hundred-million deal. The forty million you invested upfront will now be seized as a penalty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;Forty million?!&#34; The phone slipped from his hands and hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stood there, stunned. That was half of Dury Group&#39;s working capital for the year. How could he possibly explain this to his family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought struck him. He turned toward the elevator and slammed his palm against the button. &#34;Rylie! Rylie!Come out here and explain yourself! Tell me who you really are! Say something-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could get another word out, two bodyguards yanked him back. They tossed him out the front door. Casper followed right behind, both men thrown out together like trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alistair stepped out of the building and glanced down at the two men on the pavement. &#34;Mr. Dury,your reputation as a womanizer is known all over Crolens.Do you actually believe that deal was yours because of merit? If Mr. Felix Owen hadn&#39;t held affection for his younger sister- who already had a childhood engagement with you- you wouldn&#39;t have gotten anywhere hear this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lip curled as he kept going. &#34;And yet, you had the nerve to cancel the engagement with Miss Kirk? You had everything handed to you, and you threw it away.That&#39;s not bold. That&#39;s just stupid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred&#39;s vision began to blur. A wave of heat rose in his chest. He coughed, spit out blood, and collapsed on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper stood frozen. The blow had left him speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stepped onto the tenth floor and followed the secretary down the hallway to Deandre&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a side door flew open. A striking woman with tight curls and a sharp outfit stepped into the hallway,her face clouded with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took off her sunglasses, snatched the secretary by the arm, and snapped, &#34;I&#39;ve been sitting here for three hours. Where&#39;s Deandre? Why won&#39;t he see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The secretary ducked her head. &#34;Miss Johnson, please try not to make things difficult. Mr. Owen is still tied up. It might be better to return another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just talked to Paola. She told me Deandre isn&#39;t meeting with anyone important today,&#34; said Fiona Johnson, folding her arms.&#34;So should I believe you or his cousin&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can call Mr. Owen yourself if you like,&#34; the secretary answered politely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiona&#39;s stare darted to Rylie. She studied her face,her posture,her poise-and felt her stomach drop.&#34;Who is she? What is she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; said the secretary softly. &#34;That&#39;s confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that, Fiona jumped to conclusions, assuming that Deandre had found someone new just after breaking up with her, causing her eyes to redden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie caught the emotion on Fiona&#39;s face but didn&#39;t slow her pace. She walked right past and entered the CEO&#39;s office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaken and uneasy, Fiona immediately called Paola.&#34;He&#39;s refusing to meet me. Could you please talk to him for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola took a moment before answering, &#34;That&#39;s not something I can do. If Deandre doesn&#39;t want to meet,no one can change his mind. If he&#39;s made up his mind,you&#39;ll just have to accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How am I supposed to accept this?&#34; Fiona said, voice rising. &#34;I just watched a young woman walk into his office!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola sounded impatient now. &#34;Fiona, Deandre is rarely home. He&#39;s been around beautiful women all year long. You should&#39;ve known this would happen when you got involved with someone like him.&#34;</p>
