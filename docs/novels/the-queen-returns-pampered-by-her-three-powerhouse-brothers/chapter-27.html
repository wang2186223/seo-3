                <p>Taking a close look at the second envelope, the servant studied the name before finally saying, &#34;The other for Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s features went rigid. &#34;Who did you say it&#39;s for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief flickered in Percy&#39;s eyes as he lunged for the letter. &#34;What are you saying? How could that be for Rylie? She&#39;s only just arrived today. There&#39;s no way she even knows Brad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes caught the name. It was impossible to deny -it was for Rylie. &#34;How could this be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie had come from the countryside, returning to the Owen family for the first time today. The thought of her somehow knowing Brad made no sense at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded not only the Garretts, but also the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ens. No one could figure out why Brad would send Rylie a cake out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment crept across Paola&#39;s face as she read the name herself. All her earlier excitement now felt ridiculous. She forced a thin smile and looked straight at Rylie. &#34;So, you and Brad already knew each other? Seems I made a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s usual calm was starting to crumble, leaving her with only an uneasy grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Rylie had seen the oversized cake,she suspected what was happening. Percy, though reluctant, surrendered the envelope to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With careful hands, Kendrick broke the seal and scanned the letter. The note explained how Rylie had spent her birthday at the Kirk family with Stacey. A frown darkened his brow as he tried to mask the pain, then he passed the letter to Felix. &#34;To be honest, if it weren&#39;t for Brad, we never would have found Rylie. He wrote to congratulate me for reuniting with my granddaughter and clearly said the cake is meant for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix, after reading, handed the note to his brothers.His expression grew even grimmer. &#34;Today isn&#39;t Rylie&#39;s real birthday. Her actual birthday falls on Christmas. There&#39;s no mistaking it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre, always the careful one, spoke up. &#34;I&#39;ve known Brad a long time, and he&#39;s never sent a birthday present to any girl before. Why is Rylie special the moment she walks back into our lives?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped out of Marcus as he gave Deandre&#39;s shoulder a reassuring pat. &#34;No sense worrying.Maybe Brad just wanted to be thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre&#39;s tone grew unyielding. &#34;He&#39;s. never gone out of his way for anyone else, not once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That remark struck Paola hard, making her squirm inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s message to Rylie was nothing more than a brief, heartfelt wish: &#34;Happy Birthday, Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when they had that dinner high above the city,he&#39;d paid attention to her every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from a handful of colleagues and her own patients, Rylie had never encountered someone who listened to her so closely-and acted on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, wistful smile touched Rylie&#39;s mouth. &#34;The Kirks picked the day they adopted me to be my birthday. For years, I marked the occasion, not realizing it wasn&#39;t the real one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brad&#39;s letter crumpled in his grip, Deandre spoke with quiet resolve. &#34;From now on, every single birthday, we&#39;ll celebrate in style. Count on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude filled Rylie&#39;s voice. &#34;Let&#39;s slice the cake.Everyone should have a piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of that cake grated on Paola&#39;s nerves. She excused herself quickly. &#34;I&#39;mstuffed. I&#39;ll be in the piano room working on music,&#34; she said, escaping the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everyone had enjoyed dessert, Rylie checked the clock and rose to take her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry clouded Kendrick&#39;s features. He tightened his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>old on her hand. &#34;W/hy are you heading out so late?Are you not happy spending time with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the worry etched on her grandfather&#39;s face,Rylie offered a gentle smile. A touch of warmth entered her voice as she explained, &#34;Of course I enjoy staying with you. I&#39;ve got a race tonight. If l don&#39;t head out soon, I&#39;ll miss the start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of racing caught Kendrick completely off guard. &#34;A race? You&#39;re a racer, Rylie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning, she replied, &#34;I am, and I&#39;m actually pretty good at it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre, curiosity piqued, chimed in right away, &#34;Let me drive you over there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix, however, held up a hand to intervene. &#34;It isn&#39;t a good idea for you to be out right now. Marcus, you go with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Felix, Rylie said, &#34;Felix, I can get there on my own. Just let Rory keep me posted about your surgery. I&#39;d like to assist when it happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix looked stunned. &#34;You&#39;d do the surgery yourself? Aren&#39;t you still a student?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite knowing his sister&#39;s skills, a little doubt flickered across his face. He worried that she was still gaining experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie picked up on his unease and tried to put him at ease. &#34;I won&#39;t be operating alone. I&#39;ll be observing while another doctor handles it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Felix was now her brother, she felt that only by staying by his side during his surgery couId she feel at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Felix gave a nod, this time with full confidence. &#34;If you want to get hands-on experience,go for it.I can handle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laugh was soft and sincere. &#34;Thank you, Felix.That means a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, she promised Kendrick that she would come back soon. Just as she reached the door, her phone buzzed-Britton had messaged to  say that the race was moved to an off-road track three days ago and wanted to know her timne of arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie, riding her motorcycle, stopped just outside the estate. She checked the time and called Britton. &#34;Put me last in the lineup. There&#39;s a chance I&#39;ll be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a high-end car slid past her, then eased back in reverse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window at the rear lowered, and Brad&#39;s striking features appeared. &#34;Out this late-where are you off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Brad, Rylie instantly saw her opportunity to make up for lost time. She left her bike on the curb and leaned against his car window.&#34;There&#39;s a race at the mountain circuit tonight. I have to be there by eight. Any chance you could help? I&#39;ll knock some off your next treatment bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad, although scheduled for an international meeting at the same hour, paused to check the time and quickly weighed his options.  &#34;Hop in. I&#39;ll have a helicopter ready for you,&#34;&#39; Brad replied, making arrangements without hesitation.</p>
