                <p>&#34;The entire high society is watching now. Not just me-Paola is under the spotlight too.&#34; Rylie smiled.&#34;Ever since I came back quietly, those who know who I really am believed I didn&#39;t belong in the Owen family.I used to think family matters didn&#39;t need the world&#39;s opinion. But I overlooked one thing - my brothers&#39; and grandfather&#39;s pride. As an Owen, I have to show the world that I, Rylie, am just as remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words stirred something deep in her brothers and grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre,though still unsure, stepped forward first. &#34;So, Rylie, what do you plan to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m signing up for the famous Wesdown International Piano Competition. Registration for our national division opens tonight,&#34; Rylie answered calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre, uninterested in music, blinked in confusion.&#34;What&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s one of the most prestigious piano competitions in the world. Held every four years,&#34;Marcus explained.He then looked puzzled. &#34;But it&#39;s not time yet. How do you know registration is open?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie smiled faintly. &#34;I saw it online. Registration begins at 8 PM.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus frowned and shook his head. &#34;That&#39;s not possible. The Wesdown competition is strict with timing.Registration never opens early. And with how confidential they are, even prep work is kept under wraps.Rylie, you might&#39;ve seen fake news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have the PR team clear up the rumors,&#34; Felix added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need.&#34; Rylie glanced at the clock.&#34;Let&#39;s just wait till eight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how sure she was, her brothers didn&#39;t argue. They adored her, and if anything went wrong, they were ready to back her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they didn&#39;t know was that Rylie, under her identity as X. Aria, had made one phone call that changed the entire competition schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At exactly 8 PM....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The official Wesdown website released full details-the competition date, venue, registration process, and awards-exactly as Rylie had said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; eyes widened. He gripped the edge of his tablet tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The portal is really open,&#34; he muttered, refreshing the page to be sure it wasn&#39;t a prank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to him, Deandre noticed his reaction and leaned in. A smile broke across his face. &#34;Rylie was right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This doesn&#39;t make sense. Even the President wouldn&#39;t get anything out of those music elites. They never leak information, let alone release it early,&#34; Marcus said, still stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix took a sip of wine and smiled. &#34;Marcus, girls are allowed to keep secrets. If she doesn&#39;t want to say more, just let it be. As long as she&#39;s happy,that&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus rubbed his forehead. &#34;I know we all revolve around Rylie, but it feels like she doesn&#39;t just know the organizers-she&#39;s deeply involved with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe. Who knows? Tell me, how good is Rylie&#39;s playing? I only know it sounds nice, but I can&#39;t tell who plays better,&#34; Deandre said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s a natural,&#34; Marcus said honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix chuckled, and Marcus shot him a look. &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; Felix replied, covering his mouth. &#34;Just remembered the hospital staff once said the same thing.Back then, they said Rylie was born to be a doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre let out a sigh. &#34;She really is a genius. So, what are we even worried about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, as fake videos about Rylie continued to spread online, the Owens&#39; silence confused the public.People began to wonder if she truly wasn&#39;t favored. If she was, why weren&#39;t the Owens speaking up or trying to erase those videos online?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel had been keeping an eye on the Owen family&#39;s reaction. She believed trouble might be coming and had already prepared a counterplan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola, who had once been tricked badly, grew uneasy. &#34;Mom, do you think Rylie&#39;s setting another trap for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel thought for a while,then smiled with confidence.&#34;Devin has always been reliable. The Owens probably hired experts to verify the videos. They must&#39;ve confirmed that the one online is real and the one Rylie showed was fake. That&#39;s why they&#39;re disappointed in her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s eyes lit up. &#34;So what should we do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Isabella called, her tone light and mocking. &#34;Paola, did you hear Rylie&#39;s latest joke?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola glanced at Laurel before replying.&#34;NO,I&#39;ve been practicing piano. Haven&#39;t kept up with gossip. What did Rylie do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Wesdown International Piano Competition has opened registration for our division. I saw Rylie&#39;s name on the website.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola looked shocked. She turned to check the calendar. &#34;But isn&#39;t that held every four years? It&#39;s not time yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella replied, &#34;Exactly. But the organizers suddenly decided to hold the competition early, catching all of us off guard. Paola, are you planning to register too? Winning a prize in that competition has always been yourdream,&#34; Isabella said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s heart skipped. Winning at Wesdown meant joining the ranks of the best pianists. She might not reach Marcus&#39; global fame, but at home, she&#39;d finally be respected. Still...</p>
