                <p>The familiar voice caught Rylie&#39;s attention, and her eyes found Leland in the crowd. Surprise flickered across his face-clearly, he hadn&#39;t expected to see her today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few days had passed since their last encounter, yet Leland appeared almost gaunt, deep shadows circling his eyes - a testament to exhaustion and sleepless nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most likely, the constant turmoil at home was taking its toll, leaving every responsibility directly on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie quickly looked away, her features cool and unreadable, making no effort to acknowledge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret pressed heavily on Leland; beneath the surface, anguish simmered. The Kirk family&#39;s business had stumbled again, all thanks to entanglements with the Durys. Every new venture crumbled, misfortune dogging his every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A desperate need for comfort gnawed at him, but with chaos already consuming the household,he kept his worries hidden, unwilling to burden anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seminar invitation had come after much effort-one small hope to seek help for Brad and perhaps lift the Kirks&#39; fortunes, though he doubted that it would be enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing among a roomful of celebrated physicians,Leland felt the weight of every glance. The Kirk family&#39;s troubles were common knowledge, and few cared to interact with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wrestling with his thoughts, he finally crossed the room to where Rylie sat and took the seat beside her. &#34;Could we talk for a moment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s gaze slid over, detached and even. &#34;We&#39;ve already gone our separate ways. Remember? I am no longer a Kirk. What&#39;s left to discuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump rose in Leland&#39;s throat. &#34;Nicolas... He&#39;s scheduled for amputation next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face betrayed nothing, the news met with cold silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding back his sorrow, Leland continued, &#34;Since you walked away, everything at home has unraveled.Please,Rylie-come back. Help Nicolas. Help Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie rested her chin on her palm, pausing thoughtfully before answering, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll come back&#39;-if you send Stacey packing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply was immediate, almost defensive. &#34;Rylie,you&#39;re an Owen now and have all the wealth. If I kick Stacey out, she&#39;ll have nowhere to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pfft.&#34; A sudden, cold laugh escaped Rylie. &#34;So when you demanded I walk out on the Kirks, did it cross your mind that I might end up homeless, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s mouth opened, but words failed him. &#34;l...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a look of pure disdain, Rylie turned away. &#34;Don&#39;t waste my time.Go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Leland hesitated, then added, his voice low, &#34;I&#39;ve heard about you and your mentor,how you supposedly stole the Wildes&#39; medical formula. If Brad or Sean hears about this, even being the richest man&#39;s granddaughter won&#39;t shield you in Crolens, the territory of Morgan family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh.&#34; Rylie&#39;s lips curled into a sneer. &#34;After all the times the Wildes have played you for a fool, you still buy their lies?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That jab left Leland momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the Wildes&#39; reputation in medicine was ironclad,and as a staff member at VitaLink Hospital, Leland couldn&#39;t help but lean on their authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re talented, Rylie. You wouldn&#39;t have won Aetheris Pharmacy&#39;s trust if you weren&#39;t. You brought back rare meds for Nicolas and Mom.&#34; He tried again,softer now. &#34;But you&#39;re not in Ms. Wilde&#39;s league.She&#39;s seen more patients than you could imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were meant to be advice, but to Rylie, it was just pointless lecturing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flicked her gaze toward the door, dismissing him with a wave. &#34;Looks like the show&#39;s about to start. If you stay here nagging, you&#39;ll lose your shot to get the Wildes&#39; attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance was all it took-Leland noticed the shift outside, shot to his feet, and hurried off, leaving Rylie in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In this world of white coats and quiet power,reputation was everything. The room buzzed with conversation, doctors from top schools and families mingling easily - yet every single one of them deliberately left the young woman by the window out of their circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pharmacy whose name no one recognized was bound to be dismissed, written off as unworthy of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast was stark. Evita swept into the hall and instantly became the center of attention, half the crowd quick to cluster around her. &#34;Ms. Wilde, what a pleasure to see you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A composed &#34;Yes,&#34; was her response, as Evita moved gracefully through the throng. Marsha kept pace beside her, greeting acquaintances with the easy polish of someone used to admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the Wildes, this event belonged to them; what happened outside was insignificant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing tall, Evita and Marsha advanced, not bothering to acknowledge Rylie as they strode past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reason for Rylie&#39;s isolation was no secret; it wasn&#39;t just her obscure pharmacy background.The Wildes&#39; public accusation- that she&#39;d stolen their high-purity medication to treat Brad, slipping in under false pretenses - had poisoned her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most present viewed her with thinly veiled contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was rich with the scent of fresh coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed by the coldness that surrounded her, Rylie drummed her fingers on the chair&#39;s arm, sitting alone in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to her cup, a faint, enigmatic smile touching her lips. As far as she was concerned, the real fireworks had yet to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden, commanding voice cut through the hum of conversation. &#34;Attention, please.&#34; The words echoed from above, silencing the room for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned as Brad, immaculate in a dark tailored suit, began his slow descent from the second floor.</p>
