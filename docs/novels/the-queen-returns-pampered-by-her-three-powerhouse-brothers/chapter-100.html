                <p>A young man chimed in with a smirk, &#34;Playing the piano is an art-it takes elegance and skill, not just money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room burst into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola waved a hand dismissively, pretending to be gracious. &#34;Alright, everyone, let&#39;s not be harsh. Even though Rylie didn&#39;t make it past the preliminaries, her courage is admirable. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll succeed someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella laughed loudly, covering her mouth with mock shock. &#34;Courage? Shouldn&#39;t it be cheekiness? If it were me, I&#39;d be too embarrassed to show my face.But some people have thick skin- failing the first round and still showing up at such a fancy event!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laughter only grew louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few rich kids exchanged amused glances. One of them even pushed a wine glass toward Rylie, silently suggesting she drink her shame away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s expression darkened. He set his wine glass down with a firm thud. &#34;That&#39;s enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny poured a glass of juice, walked over to Rylie,and quietly took the wine glass away. &#34;You look tired.Don&#39;t harm your health over this. Try some orange juice instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie took the glass. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny nodded and rested a hand lightly on the back of her chair. His gaze swept the room as he spoke.&#34;Everyone here is my guest. Rylie is my guest too. If anyone can&#39;t show respect, I won&#39;t hesitate to ask them to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had expected Johnny to defend her. Paola&#39;s face stiffened as she awkwardly adjusted her dress,trying to hide the resentment in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she looked up again, her expression had softened into a polite smile. &#34;Johnny&#39;s right. We&#39;re all friends here-let&#39;s be civil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella quickly changed the subject. &#34;Weren&#39;t we supposed to have a yacht party? When are we heading out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny replied casually, &#34;The yacht is ready. You can head over anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Rylie. &#34;But Miss Owen, could you wait a moment? I have a favor to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie nodded. &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Johnny was about to leave with her, Paola stood up abruptly. &#34;Johnny, where are you taking Rylie?Is this somewhere the rest of us can&#39;t go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned to the two of them. The air grew tense with quiet speculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone cracked a joke, &#34;Are you ditching our lovely Paola for a private moment with Miss Owen? Since when did your taste change so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola looked visibly hurt, her eyes locked on Johnny.&#34;So this really is a private date? Maybe I shouldn&#39;t stay here after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella chimed in, &#34;Johnny, say something! You can&#39;t seriously be planning a date with Rylie-you&#39;ve only met her once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie raised an eyebrow. &#34;Now I&#39;m curious too.What do you need my help with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny let out a resigned sigh. &#34;My grandmother&#39;s a collector. She recently wanted to donate a set of ancient jewelry to the museum. It&#39;s said to be a thousand years old, but the museum&#39;s expert says it&#39;s fake.We invited other appraisers, and they all agreed -it&#39;s a counterfeit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tilted her head. &#34;How much did she pay for it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Twenty million dollars,&#34; Johnny replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps filled the room. Even Rylie blinked in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Johnny had come to her again- this wasn&#39;t just about pride. It was about a twenty-thousand-million-dollar mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola couldn&#39;t help herself. &#34;Johnny, this is a professional matter. If all the experts say it&#39;s fake,what can Rylie possibly do? She&#39;s not a magician or something, unable to turn a fake into a real one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny looked directly at Rylie. &#34;After what happened at the Buckley family&#39;s gala, I believe in your judgment. You clearly know your craft. I&#39;d really appreciate it if you&#39;d take another look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a slight nod. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny turned with her.&#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella suddenly stepped in front of the door and shouted, &#34;Mr. Reid, have you had too much to drink?The news about Rylie plagiarizing Paola&#39;s sheet music is everywhere. She&#39;s done it before! And the jewelry appraisal at the gala? That was just luck. Don&#39;t trust her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny&#39;s expression turned cold. His voice dropped &#34;P&#39;ll judge right and wrong for myself.&#34; He stared at Isabella, his tone biting. &#34;Besides, I don&#39;t remember inviting you. Paola insisted on bringing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella turned pale. &#34;I...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johnny looked at Paola next. &#34;Please keep your friends in check. She&#39;s rude and lacks basic manners.Don&#39;t bring her next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isabella stood frozen, stunned speechless. Paola&#39;s face turned stiff with embarrassment.</p>
