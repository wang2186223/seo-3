                <p>Rylie didn&#39;t hesitate to cut Paola off, saying, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. I have no plans to sleep in the guest room. I&#39;ll be heading home tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her intentions were clear - she had come only to acknowledge the family bond, not to get tangled in the games that came with old money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A simple dinner is all I&#39;m here for,&#34; Rylie suggested.&#34;There&#39;s something else I need to take care of later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Percy uttered &#34;guest room,&#34; Kendrick&#39;s face grew thunderous. His voice stiffened. &#34;Guest room? Are you telling me my granddaughter is relegated to the guest roomn in her own house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s gaze turned cold too as he leveled it at Percy.&#34;Have you forgotten whose name is on this deed?You and Paola live here by my grace. Every meal,  every luxury, comes from my pocket. My sister comes home, and you think her room is up for debate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre&#39;s tone was sharp, his glare colder still. &#34;It seems running this estate has gone to your head,Percy. You&#39;re suggesting my sister should take the piano room as if she needs a handout from Paola?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of Rylie&#39;s brothers would stand by and watch their newly returned sister slighted by relatives acting above their place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s hands shook, color drained from her cheeks.&#34;No, I swear, that wasn&#39;t my intention - I never meant to treat Rylie like a charity case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dismissive snort came from Deandre. &#34;If that&#39;s so,then why not pack your things and clear out of the room yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s mouth fell open in shock. &#34;What do you mean? Where am I.supposed to stay...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus gave a mild smile, his voice smooth yet edged with quiet mockery. &#34;You&#39;ll be fine in the piano room. You&#39;re composing for the film, aren&#39;t you? lt makes sense not to move your instrument around.Besides, the master suite you&#39;ve been using always belonged to my sister. Giving it back is just putting things right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage exploded from Percy as he jumped to Paola&#39;s defense. &#34;Marcus, Deandre, why are you picking on her? She&#39;s on track to be a musician,Marcus, just like you! Isn&#39;t that more impressive than someone who grew up in the sticks and just got here? You&#39;re just playing favorites!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel, recognizing that Percy had gone too far,gave him a quick smack on the arm and hissed, &#34;That&#39;s enough out of you! Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy, refusing to back down, retorted, &#34;Why are you coming after me? I&#39;m just telling it straight. This place has plenty of rooms-why kick Paola out the minute Rylie walks in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola, struggling to mask her embarrassment, cut in before the argument escalated further. Turning to Rylie, she softened her voice. &#34;Your brothers are right, but Percy doesn&#39;t mean any harm. He only wants to look out for me. If you&#39;d prefer the piano room or my bedroom, you&#39;re welcome to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the way Paola maneuvered, Rylie couldn&#39;t help but think of Stacey&#39;s familiar manipulative tactics. For a moment, she was left at a loss for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching tactics, Paola put on a show of indignation and snapped at Percy. &#34;Percy, apologize to Rylie.She&#39;s your cousin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sneer curled on Percy&#39;s lips. &#34;Cousin? That&#39;s a stretch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that instant, Kendrick-having had quite enough - slammed his cup down so hard that water splashed by Percy&#39;s feet. The sharp sound made Percy flinch. Without a hint of warmth, Kendrick flicked the water from his hand and delivered a cold stare. &#34;By blood, she is my granddaughter. Not worthy of being your cousin? You&#39;d do well to remember where you come from.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words alone were enough to turn Percy from defiant to instantly meek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kendrick, I...I am sorry. I made a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kendrick&#39;s tone turned colder than before. &#34;Serenity Manor was purchased for my granddaughter&#39;s comfort during vacations. Paola, you&#39;ve had the run of this place for more than ten years-tell me,havel ever treated you unfairly?&#34; Whatever warmth he once felt toward her had vanished, his gaze steady and imposing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>White as a sheet, Paola shook her head in panic.&#34;Never, I swear. You and my cousins must have misunderstood me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s face was just as tense. Pulling her children closer, she forced a smile in Rylie&#39;s direction. &#34;I should have handled this better. Rylie is welcome to any room she wants - none of us will stand in her way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix kept his voice even. &#34;If that&#39;s settled, let&#39;s stop with the comments that cause confusion. Deandre, why don&#39;t you show Rylie around? Once the room&#39;s ready,she can move in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Deandre slipped an arm around Rylie&#39;s shoulders, his grin playful and conspiratorial. &#34;Let&#39;s check out the vineyard. I&#39;ll let you pick the best grapes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she glanced at his hand, Rylie spotted an old scar,something oddly familiar she couldn&#39;t place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still deep in thought, she allowed Deandre to lead her toward the rows of vines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were gone, Kendrick declared, &#34;Tonight marks my first dinner with Rylie. Have the kitchen prepare a variety of dishes so we can find out what she likes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel quickly agreed. &#34;I&#39;ll see to it. Percy, help your sister gather her things so the staff can tidy up her room for Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration followed Paola back to her quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing into Laurel&#39;s arms, she let her complaints</p>
                
                
                
                <p>spill out. &#34;Why does all their attention shift to Rylie the moment she comes home, no matter how hard I try?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel&#39;s hand landed softly on Paola&#39;s shoulder,her voice soothing but with an unmistakable edge. &#34;You can point the finger at your father-being a branch of the Owen family means we&#39;re always left on the sidelines. He&#39;s never had much talent, and it&#39;s held us back. Still, Paola, I&#39;ve raised you to the highest standards, not like Rylie, who grew up in a remote village. Your cousins are only caught up in the novelty of her return. When it comes to important occasions, they&#39;ll see you&#39;re the one who truly belongs as an Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted Paola&#39;s chin, gently dabbing at her tear-stained cheeks, her tone suddenly grave. &#34;All you need to do is outshine Rylie in everything. Are you ready for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thrill of determination shot through Paola as she nodded.&#34;I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, among sun-dappled vines, Deandre plucked two heavy clusters of grapes, offering them to Rylie. &#34;These are at their sweetest right now. Give them a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Popping a grape in her mouth, Rylie shifted the conversation, asking in a casual tone, &#34;Deandre,where did you get that scar on your hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flash of pride lit up his smile under her gaze.&#34;Oh,that? It&#39;s nothing much. Got into a scuffle at a casino in Aclogow - a machete caught me when a fight broke out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memory served her well. Just a year earlier,traveling with the Kirk family, she&#39;d stumbled upoon that very brawl at an Aclogow casino, a clash involving the Costa Syndicate. She had seen Deandre defend a stranger, earning that very scar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, word had spread in the underworld. Rumors hinted that Alexis Costa, the notorious syndicate leader, was stepping down, but the new heir wasn&#39;t his son-it was an enigmatic figure from Kouhron.Soon after, the dark web blazed with a hundred-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>million-dollar bounty on this mysterious successor&#39;s head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Piecing together what she knew of timelines and aliases, Rylie had her suspicions- Deandre fit the puzzle as the shadowy candidate poised to inherit the Costa empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also remembered how that online post had drawn a swarm of killers to the hunt, making Deandre the second most valuable mnark in the world. In short,danger was always closing in around him.</p>
