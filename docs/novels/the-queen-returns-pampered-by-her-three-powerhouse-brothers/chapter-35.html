                <p>&#34;Yes. It&#39;s late now, and Ithought I should give you a ride home. By the way, the race was a surprise.&#34;Brad&#39;s eyes lowered slightly, his gaze softening into the shape of a smile. It was the kind of smile that reminded Rylie of a winter sky-clear and cold, distant but glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie had seen attractive men before, but none quite like him. Brad carried both calmn and danger in one breath, gentle in manner yet holding the firm presence of someone who had faced war. That kind of balance was rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie composed herself quickly and smiled. &#34;I can drive myself. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad didn&#39;t waver. &#34;It&#39;s not safe to be out this late. I&#39;ll take you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie lifted a brow and motioned lightly.&#34;Then lower your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the crowd, Phillip spotted them. Brad beside Rylie had a quiet elegance. He lowered his head slightly, a small bow. Rylie reached up and tugged the ribbon from his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done.&#34; Rylie tossed the ribbon to the side.&#34;Let&#39;s move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Brad rose again, he caught her scent. His fingers twitched faintly. A small smile tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock followed at a distance, completely baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Brad would only bow like that when saving the prisoners of war. Yet now, Brad had done it willingly-for Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip tried to get a closer look, but before he could step forward, the crowd surged. The two had already vanished into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Rylie boarded the helicopter, she caught sight of the judges approaching in haste. Their eyes brimmed with admiration, something that was rarely offered so freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them called out, &#34;If we had known you would attend, we&#39;d have done things differently tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well,&#34; said Brad, his voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors slid shut, the judges remained below, their backs straight, standing in ful attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when the truth settled in. Rylie turned to him. &#34;You were the one who filed the report against Stacey.It was you, wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad leaned back and tapped the armrest with two fingers. &#34;If someone spots a mistake in a race and speaks up, is that not the right thing to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Usually, a simple complaint fromn the crowd wouldn&#39;t lead to this kind of fallout. Races like these were wrapped up in sponsors and influence. Judges often looked the other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not when Brad was involved. Even the President treated him with formality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; Rylie gave a small nod. &#34;If you ever need anything, I can offer a discount on your treatment fees.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad gave a quiet laugh. His eyes shifted again, soft around the edges. The light caught them just right,turning what once felt distant into something warmer. Something less guarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate that, Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that evening, Rylie returned to the community near the military compound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, while she was giving free consultations at the clinic in the community, Clive showed up carrying his old medical records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Kirk, could you take a look at my leg?&#34; His voice held a note of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie skimmed through the reports, then asked him to roll up his pant leg. She pressed gently along the area near his knee. He winced, breath catching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew her hand back. Her voice was steady and sure. &#34;The compression of the nerve has led to muscle weakening. Regular treatments won&#39;t be enough, but surgery paired with rehabilitation could help restore function. It won&#39;t be easy,though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive&#39;s face brightened. &#34;If it means healing, I can take whatever pain comes with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie replied, &#34;Before anything else, you&#39;ll need a series of injections. These will get your body ready for the procedure. I&#39;ll have the medication prepared and sent to your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive could hardly contain his grin. &#34;How much should I pay for the consultation upfront?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a short pause, Rylie said, &#34;Seven hundred thousand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t go easy on him either. Knowing that Clive had no shortage of money, she prescribed his medicine based on Aetheris Pharmacy&#39;s usual rates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clive found the cost reasonable and handed over the payment with a smile. &#34;This is nothing. I&#39;ve seen top doctors for this leg before, and seven hundred thousand wouldn&#39;t have even covered half of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Clive was taken care of, Rylie grabbed her helmet, mounted her motorcycle, and rode off to Aetheris Pharmacy. She wasn&#39;t expecting to bump into Freddy as he rushed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her visor. &#34;Where are you going in such a hurry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Freddy spoke fast. &#34;Trouble again. Someone&#39;s been stirring up chaos over at HaloFlow for days now.Today&#39;s worse than ever. A crowd&#39;s gathered. They&#39;re accusing Ms. Hobbes of malpractice-even death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s face darkened. She handed him a slip. &#34;This is Clive&#39;s prescription. Prepare it and have it delivered. I&#39;ll go and help Selah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie started her engine and took off. When she arrived at HaloFlow Pharmacy, she found the situation just as described. A small mob was causing damage, shouting at the building. The staff stood around Selah,trying to keep her safe. Selah herself looked furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People from nearby houses and shops had already filled the alleyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They say Selah&#39;s responsible for a death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I were! They say she used to work in a big hospital. Then she vanished. Now they think she&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got my meds from her just yesterday. Should I be worried?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s truth to this, I won&#39;t let her treat me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise bullt quickly. Selah&#39;s face turned pale, and her knees buckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yosef stepped forward, smug and loud. &#34;So this is where you&#39;ve been hiding. Funny how no one here knows what you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slow shake of his head. &#34;Still acting like the bold woman you used to be. Competing against the Wildes like it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;This place isn&#39;t for your nonsense.Leave,&#34; said Selah, holding her cane tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blocked her path. &#34;Still pretending? You think I don&#39;t know it was your idea to send that girl to the ospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selah&#39;s eyes darted up. &#34;You mean Rylie?&#34;</p>
