                <p>Laurel could no longer keep up appearances. Being threatened by someone younger, even without an audience, bruised her pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly snapped back but stopped herself. After a moment, she lowered her head. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize your grandfather had already handed over the family&#39;s authority. You&#39;re right. This is on us. I failed to raise my daughter properly. I hope you&#39;ll find it in your heart to forgive us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; Percy&#39;s voice trembled with disbelief. Watching his mother bow her head to Rylie filled him with dread.He nearly lunged forward, but Laurel tightened her grip on his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Percy! Control yourself,&#34; she hissed. Her hand shot to his neck. &#34;Apologize!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride stung, but under her stern gaze, Percy clenched his jaw and mutered, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Rylie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie knew who the true puppet master was. Of the three, Laurel schemed the most. She rose from her seat.&#34;I came on behalf of Grandpa and my brothers. Paola, since you&#39;re fine, I&#39;Il take my leave. Rest well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped out, Percy turned and punched the wall, frustration spiling out.&#34;Mom! Paola! Are you really going to let her push us around like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel placed a hand on his shoulder. &#34;You&#39;re always so quick to act. Do you actually believe I bowed down to that sly little girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy looked up. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola,sitting on the bed, slowly unwrapped the bandage from her wrist. Her voice came out low. &#34;I fell for Rylie&#39;s trick again. I didn&#39;t expect her to be this cunning. She&#39;s got the video showing my theft. I can&#39;t let anyone see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy stared in shock. Her wrist showed no injury. The blood had been faked. His mind reeled. &#34;So it&#39;s true then? What my friend told me about the recital?&#34; He stepped closer, his voice raised. &#34;Paola, you really stole Rylie&#39;s music? You copied a song from someone like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame burned Paola&#39;s cheeks, but she still spoke up. &#34;She trapped me on purpose! That piece started with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my idea! I was the one who came up with it! She only used my concept to write it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy had no grasp of music, but something about her words didn&#39;t sit right.&#34;If it really came from you,why couldn&#39;t you write it yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola froze. The question silenced her. Embarrassment swelled inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every artist knows inspiration comes and goes like a spark. But how many could actually turn that spark into something real? Who could do that? Not her. She&#39;d spent days revising draft after draft. Spencer had rejected them all. The only version he praised was the one Rylie had scribbled in minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola figured Rylie must have seen the discarded drafts and found a wvay to push the idea further. Was it possible she really carried the Owen family&#39;s gift for music? Could she truly be a genius?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola clenched her jaw. &#34;What makes you think I&#39;m not capable of composing something that good? Rylie stole my concept. There&#39;s no other explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel quickly backed her up. &#34;Rylie never studied music. If she has any skill at all, it came from using Paola&#39;s ideas. That&#39;s the only reason her piece sounds decent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Percy looked calm on the outside, but something inside him wouldn&#39;t let go of what Rylie said earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Percy, don&#39;t forget your enlistment check-up is tomorrow. Head home and rest. Don&#39;t stay out late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mother&#39;s words sent him out of the hospital. As soon as he left, a man in a hat entered the room.He looked like a photographer. After inspecting a camera hidden near the ceiling, he turned to Laurel.&#34;Ms.Garrett, the footage is clean. We can edit it as needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laurel looked pleased. Paola, on the other hand, fidgeted. &#34;Mom, are you absolutely sure the man you hired won&#39;t mess anything up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t take chances,&#34; Laurel replied. &#34;That little brat is sneaky. I paid seven hundred thousand for a top-tier thief. No matter where she stashes that video, he&#39;ll get it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they plotted indoors, Rylie walked out of the hospital, helmet in hand, ready to hop on her motorcycle.Just as she was about to mount, she spotted a group of boys shoving an elderly beggar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man tried to shield his body, but the kids pushed him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the ground, his strained voice cracked. &#34;Stop! Don&#39;t do that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s expression turned icy. She marched over and seized the leader by the collar. &#34;At your age, and you&#39;re already picking on the elderly? Who raised you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by her fierce tone, the boys scattered and ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie crouched to gather the man&#39;s bread. Once she helped him up, he took her hand and said with gratitude, &#34;Thank you, dear. I had no idea what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing.&#34; Rylie smiled as she steadied him onto his cart. &#34;Some kids just need someone to knock sense into them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After he left, she turned back toward her motorcycle, but a sudden breeze caught her attention. She froze mid-step. Something didn&#39;t feel right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, woody scent lingered in the air. It wasn&#39;t the kind of smell you&#39;d associate with a beggar.She knew that perfume well-- an exclusive fragrance made in tiny batches. It sold for nearly a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand slipped into her pocket. It was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie turned instantly and dashed in the direction the old man had gone. But he was already gone. Not a trace. Whoever he was, he knew how to move undetected. Still, Rylie believed no one could disappear so cleanly that she couldn&#39;t catch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood by her motorcycle again, one foot planted, staring down the vacant street. Her voice came soft with a grin. &#34;Interesting.&#34;</p>
