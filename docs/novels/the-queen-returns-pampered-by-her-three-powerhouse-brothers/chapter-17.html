                <p>Year after year, the Kirk family spared no expense for Stacey&#39;s celebration- filling the house with guests,lighting candles, and slicing up cake for her wishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only at the very end, Stacey would feign generosity,announcing that Rylie&#39;s birthday should be celebrated too, and press the slightly wilted crown onto Rylie&#39;s head, insisting that she make a wish over the remnants of Stacey&#39;s cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t explain why she&#39;d dredged up such a sickening old memory with this imposing man across from her. Her tone was airy, as if none of it mattered.&#34;Just think of it as a family joke,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful silence settled before Brad replied, &#34;I heard the Kirks adopted you young. Your biologica parents are supposed to live out in the countryside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie confirmed it with a nod. &#34;That&#39;s right. Fernridge -a little village out on the fringes of Crolens. When I get the chance, I&#39;ll try to find them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad&#39;s fingertips drummed a slow rhythm against the table, his eyes distant. &#34;Funny how life works. That&#39;s quite the coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply shook his head, choosing not to elaborate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumor had it that the missing daughter of the Owen family vanished from Fernridge, and every detail the investigators had uncovered matched Rylie-a medical student, just like the reports described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Rylie&#39;s past was clearly more complicated than that of a simple orphan. Brad decided that it would be cruel to raise her hopes before he had any solid proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their meal, Brad was spotted by a cluster of his former army comrades. The moment they recognized him, their faces broke into grins. &#34;General Morgan!You&#39;re back on your feet - what a sight for sore eyes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were skilled veterans among them and plenty of eager young soldiers too, but every one of them looked at Brad with genuine respect and awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent facing danger together meant that Brad couldn&#39;t just slip away. He turned and gave Rylie a reassuring look. &#34;Let my driver take you home tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few of the men, noticing the striking woman by his side,exchanged sly, knowing glances and tried not to nudge each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a quick glance at the table cluttered with liquor bottles, Rylie gave a pointed reminder. &#34;Don&#39;t touch a single drop tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brad hesitated, then offered a small nod.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Duty done, she turned on her heel and strode toward the elevator. As soon as she left, the soldiers wasted no time nudging Brad and whispering among themselves. &#34;She&#39;s even laying down the law about drinking. Is she your girlfriend or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All these years you spent deployed at sea, and now you finally resurface - turns out it wasn&#39;t just for work, but to go out with a gorgeous young lady!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she even legal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks like she still has homework to do...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealous quips and teasing filled the air around Brad.He pinched the bridge of his nose and interjected,&#34;Enough. She&#39;s my doctor, and a prodigy at that-show some respect. Don&#39;t go spreading gossip that&#39;ll harm her reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brad adopted his commanding tone,the playful mood vanished, replaced by qquiet respect. Yet even as they fell silent, the men were happy to see their general healthy, hoping for his quick return to service.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending from the private dining floor, Rylie found herself in the bustling lobby, where the mood was lighter and laughter filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A table full of racers noticed her arrival. One of them elbowed Phillip. &#34;Hey, isn&#39;t that your sister? Years of tearing up the tracks together, and you finally got Rylie to join the pre-race dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never invited her,&#34; Phillip replied, brows knitting as he caught sight of her retreating figure. &#34;What&#39;s she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, a distinguished man in a tailored suit exited the elevator, spotting Rylie instantly. He greeted her warmly. &#34;Dr. Kirk, thank you for saving General Morgan. If you ever dine here again, the meal&#39;s on us.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He presented her with a premium VIP card for the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie politely refused, shaking her head. &#34;That&#39;s really not necessary - but thank you for the gesture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her polite decline only seemed to fuel the man&#39;s insistence-he pressed the VIP card into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Introducing himself as Clive Perry, he explained that he once served under Brad. During a fierce naval battle, a grenade had torn through the nerves in his leg, robbing him of a normal stride. Forced into retirement, he&#39;d invested in this restaurant with his wife&#39;s family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If not for this injury, I&#39;d have stood by General Morgan&#39;s side for at least two more years,&#34; Clive said with a note of regret. &#34;You have to do everything you can for him-his men and this country need him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words struck a chord. Rylie accepted the VIP card, then reached into her bag for one of her business cards. &#34;I&#39;m based at the military compound for now. Every evening, I take patients at the clinic. lf you want to discuss your leg, you&#39;re welcome to come by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion swept across Clive&#39;s face, his voice trembling. &#34;Are you saying there&#39;s hope for my leg?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie kept her words honest and measured. &#34;We&#39;d need to run a full evaluation before I can make any promises. 1 won&#39;t know for certain until then, but l&#39;ll do all I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clasped her hand with gratitude. &#34;If you&#39;re the one who healed General Morgan, I trust you completely. If anyone can help me, it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While their brief handshake and card exchange meant one thing to them, Phillip saw it from a different angle entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A racer at the next table leaned in, eyeing Clive with suspicion. &#34;Who&#39;s that older guy? When did Rylie start getting close to people like him?&#34; He shot a warning look at Phillip. &#34;The world rally&#39;s almost here.If she brings drama, it could ruin our sponsorships.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation surged in Phillip; he tossed aside his napkin and strode over to intercept Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Clive disappeared than Rylie found her exit blocked. A furious voice rang out behind her.&#34;Rylie! Hold up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hand snatched at the cake box she carried,sending it jostling against the clear plastic until the frosting smeared. Rylie&#39;s face iced over as she regained her balance and turned. &#34;What is your problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s my problem? Have you looked at yourself lately?&#34; Phillip jabbed his finger at her shoulder, his anger barely contained. &#34;You&#39;ve barely been out from under the Kirk family roof and you&#39;re already throwing yourself at some old man for support?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His outburst carried through the lobby, heads turning as whispers spread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s patience snapped. She knocked his hand away. &#34;People will always believe what they want.My ties with the Kirk family are cut for good,and what l do is none of your concern.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Phillip&#39;s scowl deepened. &#34;The Kirk family hasn&#39;t made it public. As far as everyone here knows, you&#39;re still one of us,&#34; he retorted. &#34;I&#39;m warning you- if you embarrass us, don&#39;t expect to race for my team again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A harsh laugh escaped Rylie as she heard him. His teammate chimed in, &#34;Yeah, Rylie, the club&#39;s still negotiating with sponsors. Your choices reflect on us all. Apologize to Phillip and you&#39;ll still have the Kirk name behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing taller, Phillip looked down his nose at her,clearly expecting an immediate apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d already made up his mind-one word of regret,and he&#39;d let her race and maybe even vouch for her at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But...</p>
