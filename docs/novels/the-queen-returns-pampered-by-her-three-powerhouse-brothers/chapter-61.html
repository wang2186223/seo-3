                <p>The remark drew a few quiet chuckles from the gathered doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita raised her chin and walked with the pride of someone who owned the room. &#34;Some folks have never stepped inside a proper medical school,yet they still parade themselves where real expertise belongs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made sure that her voice carried as she added.&#34;Marshy, always remember - our family&#39;s medical skill isn&#39;t something just any amateur can match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re exactly right, Grandma,&#34; said Marsha,her tone obedient though mischief sparkled in her eyes.&#34;Some people can&#39;t even handle the basics of a diagnosis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two spoke in perfect rhythm. Every word that they threw stung like barbs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland shrank back and drew his hand away.He looked ready to defend himself when a crisp snap echoed across the room. He turned toward the sound. Rylie had just shut a medical case. She stood up slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita had thrown her jabs at Leland, but her real target was Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd fell still as Rylie walked toward her,each step pressing down on the old woman&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Wilde,&#34; said Rylie, her smile faint and her eyes cold. &#34;Since you&#39;re so sure of yourself...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her coat pocket and drew out a pair of medical gloves. She slid them on, taking her time.&#34;Why don&#39;t we place a little bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita narrowed her eyes. &#34;What kind of bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see who can reach the correct diagnosis first,&#34;said Rylie, tapping her fingers lightly on the edge of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita let out a laugh. &#34;Really? Do you even know who you&#39;re talking to, girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; said Rylie. She tilted her head slightly,a smile softening her words, but there was nothing gentle behind it. &#34;I&#39;m talking to a liar who&#39;s about to get completely exposed and humiliated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps and murmurs rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie turned to Leland. &#34;Want to team up with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland met her eyes. They were steady and calm,like stars blinking gently above the ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat moved as he swallowed, and then he gave a nod.&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita clenched her fists, ready to explode, when a sharp voice sliced through the air. &#34;Begin the diagnosis.&#34; It was Brad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had seen him walk in, but there he stood on the second-floor landing, his arms crossed as he looked down with mild amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember,&#34; he said, pausing for a beat as his eyes flicked toward Rylie. &#34;I expect the best result.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita threw Rylie one last glare before turning on her heel and walking away. Marsha hurried after her but still managed to toss one last insult. &#34;Just you wait,you shameless liar!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie dusted off her sleeves without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air in the hall tightened. Everyone sensed that this showdown had barely begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita stepped forward, eager to show off the Wilde name. Though Aetheris Pharmacy and Healing Hand had boxed her in, she had clawed her way into Crolens. Now she wanted to silence that arrogant Rylie once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People slowly emerged from the examination rooms arranged by the Morgans. Some shook their heads in defeat. Others worethe kind of grim faces that came from doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Evita came out smiling, walking with light steps and feigned warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re clear on the symptoms for the first two patients. But this last one-I can&#39;t pin it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; don&#39;t get it either. It looks like heatstroke. But Mr.Morgan said the three patients had the same signs as his. Surely, it shouldn&#39;t be as simple as heatstroke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And he noted coughing and numb limbs. That hints at a neurological problem, and the medical report shows a shadow. But I still can&#39;t figure out what it means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone let out a quiet sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stepped forward. Marsha halted beside Leland and scoffed, &#34;Working with a fraud will only make your defeat worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland clenched his jaw. Since boyhood, he&#39;d been hailed as a genius. Still, being mocked in public by a woman chipped away at his composure. He had held back long enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Rylie&#39;s a fraud, what does that make you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha blinked, taken off guard. &#34;You&#39;re comparing me to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s tone sharpened. The mask of calm broke.&#34;You&#39;re not even close to her level. My brother needed an amputation because of your prescriptions. What kind of healer in Crolens lets that happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha flinched. Her face twisted so badly that even her makeup couldn&#39;t hide it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; She jabbed a red-polished finger at his face.&#34;Who gave you the right to question my skills?&#34;</p>
