                <p>Soon, the surgery began. If Felix were still awake, he would find that what was happening was far more bewildering than what he had wltnessed fust now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I set the cautery to forty-flve?&#34; Rory stopped mid-cut through the muscle, glancing over his shoulder at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thirty-five will do. His clotting&#39;s already weak.&#34; Rylie stayed glued to the monitor, her hand calmly adjusting the suction tube&#39;s angle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Rory neared the tumor, a nurse passed him a pair of fine micro scissors. Before he could take them,Rylie reached out instead. &#34;Use the blunt ones. Sharp tips could rupture the capsule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, shehanded him another tool, and he accepted it like it was routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The circulating nurse gave her arm a discreet pinch. She still wasn&#39;t used to scenes like this. It felt like the student was being guided by the master-except everyone knew the roles had somehow flipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the moment that left the whole room frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory had just grabbed the forceps when Rylie caught his wrist. &#34;Wait. There&#39;s a hidden vein just off to your left-two o&#39;clock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, gently shifting the tissue to reveal a narrow vessel. &#34;There. Now go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence blanketed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared say a word about the sweat beading on Rory&#39;s forehead or how he kept glancing at her before making every decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the final fascia stitch was tied that Rory let out a sigh. &#34;Drainage tube goes next-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angle it forty-five degrees. Aim toward the diaphragm.&#34; Rylie stepped in again. Her fingertips traced along Felix&#39;s rib. &#34;His liver sits higher than normal. A standard placement might tear the capsule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the recovery room, Felix stirred to the soft buzz of nurse chatter. &#34;Dr. Carter looked like he&#39;d been through a war,&#34; one whilspered. &#34;Sald he&#39;s never fếlt that much pressure working beside Miss Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his eyes to find Rylle by the bed, one hand in her coat pocket, casually checking his vitals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A# around him, the room buzzed wlth quiet awe. Every eye seemed drawn to Rylle. Fellx blinked slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt now. His slster wás nothing short of remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie saw that he was awake. She handed the record book to a nurse and walked over to the bed. With a gentle tone, she said, &#34;The tumor&#39;s gone. The biopsy shows it&#39;s benign. You&#39;ll need to rest for at least two weeks, take it easy, and stay away from alcohol.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix&#39;s face clouded with thought. &#34;Where did you learn all this, Rylie? Even Rory- the hospital&#39;s most famous and experienced surgeon-asks for your advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a small smile. &#34;Dr. Carter doesn&#39;t take advice from me. We just help each other out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix had worked in business for years. He could see through modesty when he heard it. He still couldn&#39;t grasp how his sister, who never even finished medical school, could surpass someone like Rory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s all, then you should rest,&#34; said Rylie. &#34;I&#39;m going home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on.&#34; Felix stopped her. &#34;I&#39;ve got a meeting tonight. I left an important document at home. Can you grab it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brow furrowed. &#34;Felix, you shouldn&#39;t be stressing over meetings right now. You just had surgery.Don&#39;t you care about your recovery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix softened at her words but tried to reason with her. &#34;I didn&#39;t think the surgery would be a problem and had my assistant schedule the meeting for tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not happening,&#34; said Rylie, firm and unbending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Felix wasn&#39;t one to back down, but this time, he did. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll call Deandre.He&#39;sprobably still at the office. The meeting&#39;s tied to his research anyway. Just bring him the file, and he can go in my place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a nod. &#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Owen Tamily had already settled in Crolens after leaving Kouhron. With businesses spread across countries, Felix now worked from their Crolens branch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie went home and found the fRe. The cover read,&#34;Comprehensive Organ Regeneration and Immune Compatibility Transplant System.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed. That kind of research would need at least hundreds of millions in funding. And it was tied to Deandre.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she realize - her brothers weren&#39;t just businessmen. They had secrets too-just like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deandre was walking two separate paths. One as a mafia heir. The other as a scientist pushing boundaries in bioscience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One identity destroyed lives. The other tried to save them. Rylie couldn&#39;t help but find him fascinating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After getting the company address from Felix, she hopped on her motorcycle and took off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Fred had brought Casper-his future father-in-law-to the company. He was hoping to secure a place for the Kirk family in the project and maybe earn a share of the profits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Fred parked near the entrance, he adjusted his tie and turned to Casper. &#34;The Owen family used to be nobles back in Kouhron. They&#39;re nothing like us. They care about proper manners and old-school etiquette. That&#39;s part of why they picked us. It&#39;s how I carry myself. So once we&#39;re inside, just let me do the talking. Try not to say much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smug tone rubbed Casper the wrong way. Still, given how fast the Dury family was climbing and how his own business was falling apart, he forced a smile and nodded. &#34;I get it. I&#39;ll watch myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stepped out of the car and entered the lobby of the Owen Group. Right away, they spotted someone unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stood near the reception desk, a helmet tucked under one arm. Her black jacket clung neatly to her frame, giving her the look of someone who belonged on a racetrack, not in an office building. She was speaking to the receptionist. &#34;I&#39;m here to deliver something to Deandre Owen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist looked up briefly and asked, &#34;Do you have an appointment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie paused.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then you can&#39;t go up,&#34; said the woman, eyes on her computer. &#34;You&#39;l need fo speak with the assistant and come back another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stood silent. Felix hadn&#39;t sald anything about needing clearance. After thinking it over, she spoke again. &#34;I&#39;m his sister. I don&#39;t need an appointment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That earned her a sharp laugh. The receptionist tossed her a look dripping with scorn. &#34;You must&#39;ve heard something about the Owen daughter showing up today,&#34; she said. &#34;But do you honestly think you look like an Owen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Rylie a full once-over and continued, &#34;Have you even looked in a mirror?&#34; Women try all sorts of things to ge into Mr. Owen&#39;s office, but that excuse? Thât&#39;s á first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few nearby employees paused their tasks, drawn in by the rising tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since the Owen Group set up shop here in Crolens,&#34; the receptionist went on, her voice rising. had folks showing up daily pretending to be family. But you?&#34; She narrowed her eyes and jabbed her words with extra weight. &#34;You&#39;re the only one who walked in looking like you just came off a racetrack.</p>
