                <p>&#34;This is absurd. How could the Morgans accept such a diagnosis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Selah&#39;s student? She&#39;s a fraud. How did someone like her even get into a seminar this important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room grew louder. One voice fed another until the whole crowd was buzzing, tossing out accusations and doubts. Rylie stood calmly as whispers labeled her a fake. Leland stayed beside her, his face burning. He wanted to vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought about speaking up. But with so many doctors around-people he might work with one day -he held his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory shook his head at Leland&#39;s reaction. In a clear voice that cut through the crowd, he declared, &#34;I have faith in Rylie&#39;s skills. Even I can&#39;t figure out what the third patient&#39;s ailment is either, so it makes sense if he isn&#39;t sick at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock scanned the restless crowd. The tension had built too high. He clapped his hands to get their attention. &#34;Let&#39;s settle this. I&#39;ll announce the final result now. The person chosen to serve as chief physician for Mr. Brad Morgan,&#34; he said, &#34;is Rylie from HaloFlow Pharmacy, and Leland will be joining her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell into stunned silence. Then it shattered with disbelief. &#34;What!? Did he just say HaloFlow Pharmacy?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marsha stood frozen, stunned speechless. Evita blinked hard and rushed forward, yanking the slip of paper out of Brock&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In thick, black print, it read: HaloFlow Pharmacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland&#39;s shame gave way to surprise, then pride, as the words sank in. He realized that Rylie hadn&#39;t just held her own. She&#39;d beaten every doctor in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Voices swelled again, this time buzzing with a different kind of energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same people who&#39;d mocked Rylie were now watching her like she lit up the place. The Wilde family,meanwhile, looked like they&#39;d swallowed bitter pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita stood stiff with disbelief. Someone her age,with decades of respect behind her, had just been shown up by a girl that no one had even heard of until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the slip still clutched in her hand, she took a breath to steady herself and asked, &#34;As a physician,l know I shouldn&#39;t question the employer&#39;s decision.But I need to ask. How does someone so young,someone who hasn&#39;t even graduated, end up in charge of Mr. Brad Morgan&#39;s care? How can this choice be considered anything but reckless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Wilde family led the outcry, questioning Rylie at every turn. More doctors followed, many of them proud of their credentials, now lining up to cast doubt on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rylie? She&#39;s just some outcast from the Kirk family.I heard she was trouble. If it were Leland standing here, maybe I&#39;d believe it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With her past, there&#39;s no way she&#39;s that skilled. The Morgans should really rethink this whole thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brock eyed the group of skeptics gathering fast. &#34;So none of you are buying it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita turned sharply toward Rylie and Leland, eyes fixed on the latter. &#34;Leland, you&#39;ve been with VitaLink for years. School aside, most of your training came from this hospital. Didn&#39;t you help train her? Let&#39;s hear your thoughts about the third patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leland tried to speak, but his voice came out rough.&#34;All three diagnoses were made by Rylie. She&#39;s more capable than l am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita hadn&#39;t expected that. Her mouth tightened,clearly displeased that Leland didn&#39;t back her up. &#34;I trust the Morgan family, but I can&#39;t let an opportunist walk away with this. If I&#39;m going to lose, I need to see proof. Let her explain her diagnosis. I want to know who truly deserves the role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rory gave a dry laugh. &#34;Come on, Evita. Don&#39;t be petty. You&#39;re too old for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita snapped back, &#34;This isn&#39;t pettiness. I just want this junior to convince me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie spoke up at last, calm and unhurried. &#34;The report was fake. The patient isn&#39;t sick. The heat from his body came from a hot water bottle. The shivering? Faked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; Evita said quickly. But laughter broke out before she could say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the doors across the room opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man stepped out, walking with quiet strength. He held a hot water bottle in one hand, and though he wore a patient&#39;s gown, he carried himself like someone used to being in charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and said, &#34;Sharp eyes, young lady. You&#39;re right. I&#39;m not ill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room went dead silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evita&#39;s hand shook as she pointed. &#34;Mr. Morgan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled and handed the bottle to his butler. &#34;It&#39;s me. I was the third patient, just in disguise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he turned to Rylie with an approving look.&#34;Out of everyone here, only she figured it out.&#34;</p>
