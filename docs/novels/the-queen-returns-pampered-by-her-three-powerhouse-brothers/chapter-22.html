                <p>Stacey cut in without a pause, saying, &#34;Phillip,you need to stop with these wild claims. Rylie isn&#39;t the type to steal money from us or sell herself. She must have made money through rightful ways.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the outside looking in, what sounded like a defense actually hinted at something less charitable about Rylie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s anger burned so hot that he felt pain in his chest. &#34;At first, I hoped Rylie could settle in Crolens,but if she keeps carrying the Kirk name, she&#39;ll ruin our standing. She cannot stay here.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, self-satisfied smile crept across Stacey&#39;s lips as she lowered her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Rylie walked back into the room,contemptuous stares greeted her from every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In full view of the guests, Casper confronted her.&#34;Rylie, look at the trouble you&#39;ve brought us. Admit what you did, then offer your apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers filled the air as the guests watched,eager for the drama to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Rylie remained poised, her face unreadable. &#34;My visit was by your request. I didn&#39;t come here to put on a show of regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s outrage flared. &#34;There&#39;s no hope for you!Your brothers had every reason to drive you out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deepening scowl, Tessa said, &#34;I made it here today just to make one thing clear: Stacey is our daughter now. Rylie, there&#39;s nothing you could say or do to change that-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s words were cut short as Rylie lifted a box and revealed an emerald necklace. &#34;This necklace was given to me by your mother. I&#39;m returning it to you,Stacey.&#34; She set the box in Stacey&#39;s hands, then brought out a brooch. &#34;Here&#39;s the limited edition brooch Nicolas gifted me as a child. You should have it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next came a delicate ring. &#34;This pink diamond ring,from Leland, is yours too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she held out a smnall trophy. &#34;And the trophy Phillipo gave me after his first win-take it as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After passing the entire collection into Stacey&#39;s hands, Rylie spoke up. &#34;Everything here belongs to you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage flashed across Phillip&#39;s face. &#34;That trophy marked my first win on the track, and you hand it over without a second thought?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without responding, Rylie shoved every keepsake deeper into Stacey&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Kirk family grew tense, their rigid postures betraying the shock of realizing that Rylie had retrieved each piece just moments earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stacey faltered, struggling to find her words. &#34;Wait Rylie,these are yours. I can&#39;t accept them...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering no comfort, Rylie replied, &#34;Enjoy your new title as the Kirk family&#39;s real daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her voice, she made a public announcement to the assembled crowd. &#34;Let everyone here be witness. I was never part of the Kirk family, nor will l ever be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ironically, the words that everyone expected the Kirks to say to Rylie ended up coming from her instead,leaving the room unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Rylie fixed her gaze on Fred. &#34;And one more thing. I want nothing to do with a fool. Fred,you and Stacey make a lovely pair. I&#39;m breaking off our engagement right now. Kirk family, stop pestering me - your constant meddling has become intolerable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By saying this, she cast Fred in an unfavorable light and didn&#39;t spare Stacey from insult either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of basking in celebration, Stacey found herself overshadowed by Rylie&#39;s decisive stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word of the scene immediately damaged the Dury family&#39;s reputation, prompting Fred to snap back.&#34;You dare call me a fool? Take a look at yourself,always trailing behind me like some desperate country girl. The truth is, I&#39;ve always preferred someone like Stacey. If anyone is ending this engagement, it&#39;ll be my decision, not yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice from the crowd piped up right away. &#34;You know, the Dury family just landed a three hundred million contract with the Owen family, and everyone says Mr. Dury himself closed the deal. Honestly,with that kind of skill, Rylie must have lashed out from pure envy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fred puffed out his chest, eager to imnpress. &#34;Soon enough, our family will join Crolens&#39; social elite. Rylie,do you honestly believe you measure up to me?You&#39;re better off returning to that little town and your uneventful life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa, seeing how unyielding Rylie had become,refused to tolerate her anymore. Clutching Stacey close, she addressed the guests in a clear unwavering tone. &#34;Let it be known, the engagement with the Dury family was always meant for the Kirk family&#39;s rightful daughter. No impostors, no confusion. Stacey is my real daughter. Rylie&#39;s connection to the Kirks ends here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, Leland broke the tense silence.&#34;Rylie, if you could just change your attitude toward Mom, nothing&#39;s stopping you from coming back.Things could go back to how they were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hurt flashed in Stacey&#39;s eyes as she heard Leland&#39;s plea. Trying to hide her disappointment, she put on a sympathetic front. &#34;If you want, Rylie, I&#39;m willing to step aside. I&#39;ve known all along how you feel about Fred. Stop fighting us,and he&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughter escaped Rylie as she looked them over, a trace of mockery in her gaze. &#34;Don&#39;t bother. Like I said,you and that fool are a perfect match.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casper&#39;s temper snapped. &#34;Rylie! Walk out that door and you&#39;re out for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not even pausing, Rylie strode away, leaving no sign of regret behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her go, Tessa struggled to process the finality of it all. Pain shot through her legs, and she clung to Stacey for support.&#34;Ah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swiftly, Leland moved to steady Tessa by her other arm, concern written all over his face. &#34;Are you alright,Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache shot through Tessa&#39;s legs. She clenched her jaw and called out, &#34;Bring me my medicine at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the servants shuffled forward, uncertainty in her voice. &#34;Madam, you finished the last dose yesterday. There&#39;s nothing left for today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Displeasure flared in Tessa&#39;s eyes. &#34;Why wasn&#39;t it ready ahead of time? Do I have to remind you every single time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a worried look toward the doorway where Rylie had just vanished, the servant spoke quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Rylie Kirk was always the one who handled your medicine. Without her, no one here knows the exact recipe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That revelation left Tessa speechless. Despite having severe rheumatism for years, Rylie had carefully mixed the medication for her each time it was needed. Therefore, she had nearly forgotten about the seriousness of this illness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she noticed her mother&#39;s sudden silence,Stacey&#39;s heart skipped a beat. She moved in to comfort Tessa with a gentle embrace. &#34;It&#39;s alright,Mom. I&#39;ll do everything Rylie once did. I&#39;ll work hard to study medicine with the teachers-and even with Rylie herself if she&#39;ll let me- until I can heal your legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tessa&#39;s heart swelled with gratitude at her daughter&#39;s devotion. &#34;Stacey, you&#39;re so much better than Rylie ever was. I have faith you&#39;ll restore my health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While watching this emotional moment between these two people, Leland couldn&#39;t quiet the unease growing inside him. He suspected that letting Rylie walk away from the Kirk family would be a mistake none of them could ever undo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Rylie barely made it past the Kirk estate gates before a sudden roadblock forced her to stop.A chorus of shouting echoed overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept across the street, where a fleet of sleek Maybachs lined the curb, their uniform presence interrupted only by five helicopters descending from above, blades roaring before settling neatly nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luxury cars were no strangers to the Kirk neighborhood, but an entire parade of rare Maybachs, paired with helicopters, made even Rylie pause-she had never seen such extravagant power on display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing that she could simply steer around and that it was just another wealthy family showing up, she tried to skirt the blockade. However, dozens of  IL bodyguards emerged from the cars, dressed in perfectly fitted suits and earpieces, arranging themselves in two rigid rows that blocked her path entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the helicopter doors swung wide, and each pilot exited with brisk efficiency, assembling in a neat row while their attention fixed on the central craft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimpse of finely tailored suit pants appeared first as someone stepped onto the landing pad. Emerging from the helicopter, a tall figure radiated authority-his tailored ash-gray suit perfectly matched his striking good looks and refined presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deliberately closing the distance, he approached, his voice carrying a rich, smooth timbre. &#34;You must be Rylie Kirk?&#34;</p>
