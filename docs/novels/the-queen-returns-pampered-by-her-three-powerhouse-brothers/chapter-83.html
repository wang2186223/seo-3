                <p>At first, the audience had been charmed by Paola&#39;s performance. But after they heard Rylie&#39;s version,murmurs spread through the crowd as more discerning ears began to notice the difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The gap is staggering. You can tell the pieces aren&#39;t the same at all. She nailed every pause and shift.Rylie&#39;s performance felt alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Paola&#39;s version sounds like a watered-down copy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder it didn&#39;t sit right with me earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer stopped caring about how this would affect Paola&#39;s image. He slapped the armrest in excitement.&#34;That&#39;s it! That&#39;s the spark l&#39;ve been looking for! No wonder something felt off. This version is exactly what the scene needs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the final note vanished into the air, the room fell silent. Then applause thundered through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie stood with quiet poise. She leaned toward Paola and whispered softly, &#34;When you took my sheet music, you didn&#39;t realize I had made subtle changes. You didn&#39;t even know what you were copying.&#34; She tilted her head. &#34;And you still have the nerve to call yourself a musician.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice stayed low. The exchange stayed between them. But Paola&#39;s face turned ghostly. Her hands shook. The truth hit her like a wave. All her careful preparation had just been ripped apart by Rylie. Her big moment was ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying not to fall apart, Paola forced a tight smile. She held the microphone and tried to sound composed.&#34;Rylie, I must say-your playing was wonderful. Truly impressive.&#34; She paused. &#34;But may l ask-why did you play the original version | wrote?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone changed. She was trying to claw back whatever pride she had left.r. Aguilar&#39;s film hasn&#39;t come out yet. That piece wasn&#39;t supposed to be heard in full. I made slight changes so the full version wouldn&#39;t leak.How did you.know how it was meant to sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie&#39;s brow lifted. She was taken aback that Paola stilI had the gall to push the blame in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus&#39; brows drew together as he stared at Paola. Her remarks hinted that Rylie had stolen the music she&#39;d just performed. That didn&#39;t sit well with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to speak up when Rylie took the microphone from Paola. She gave a faint smile and turned to Spencer. &#34;So, that&#39;s how it is? If what Paola said is true, she must have given you the final version? Then why did you look so surprised just now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer didn&#39;t know what to say. The version Paola had submitted was the same one she had played earlier -Paola hadn&#39;t made any adjustments. They had finalized it weeks ago. Now that she suddenly changed her story, it made the whole thing suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should he defend her? His name had already been tied to Paola&#39;s arrangement. If she were exposed to have copied someone else&#39;s work or been dishonest, that could damage his film. Audiences were picky. A single scandal could ruin everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quick mental calculation, Spencer made his decision. He was going to say that he was unaware when Paola suddenly interjected, &#34;I haven&#39;t informed Mr. Aguilar yet. This was mainly for promotional purposes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a soft laugh that peeled away whatever pride Paola had left. &#34;You really didn&#39;t think this through.If you&#39;re going to steal, at least check for cameras first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her pocket, pulled out her phone, and handed it to her cousin. She kept her voice low.&#34;Have a look. Can you explain what you&#39;re doing in my bedroom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola stared at the screen. The footage was clear. The camera had caught her lifting the music, and even the notes on the sheet could be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twisted in panic. &#34;Rylie, are you insane? You actually installed a camera in your own room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would do such a thing? Rylie would. She always went against expectations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her fingers, she tucked her hair behind one ear and smiled. &#34;It&#39;s my room. I can put in whatever | want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two stood far from the crowd, speaking in hushed tones. The microphones remained untouched, but anyone watching could tell something was wrong. Paola&#39;s eyes were wide. Her lips trembled. It was clear they were arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus noticed the shift in the room and walked toward them. Rylie handed him the phone. He glanced at the screen. After a few seconds, he turned to Paola. &#34;So that&#39;s why the music sounded off. You copied her work and blamed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paola&#39;s breath caught. She tried to recover, but her voice quivered. &#34;Please, Marcus, let&#39;s talk about this later. Don&#39;t tell them. Please. I didn&#39;t mean to... Just don&#39;t let the audience find out. I&#39;Il explain everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that video got out, she wouldn&#39;t recover from it. Her image would shatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus didn&#39;t respond right away. He turned to his sister. &#34;Rylie, what do you want to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie gave a quiet smile. &#34;This is a family matter. If we handle it here, it&#39;ll only bring shame to us. Let&#39;s take care of it later, as she asked. Could you tell the guests something to settle the room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded slowly, moved by how patient she remained. &#34;You must have been like this when living with the Kirks. That&#39;s why they always walked all over you,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie tilted her head, the smile on her face carrying weight. &#34;I didn&#39;t stay quiet this time. I did call her out,didn&#39;t l? This might not have been laid out piece by piece, but anyone with sense should know what happened here tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marcus, who wasn&#39;t easily fooled, caught on quickly to what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the audience and spoke with grace. &#34;Everyone, I apologize for the interruption. What happened was just a family matter. I&#39;ll personally discuss the arrangement with Mr.Aguilar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a formal bow, he added, &#34;Now, please let me present the final piece.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hush settled over the room, thick with unease. Marcus had offered a way forward, but even so, it was clear to all what he had truly meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Paola stood motionless. Her gown clung to her skin, soaked with sweat. She noticed the glances from the crowd and briefly considered pretending to faint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could make her move, Rylie stepped in. She placed a steady hand on her waist. &#34;You&#39;d better not fall, Paola. It would be such a shame if you hurt that face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That comment alone was enough to jolt her upright. Paola held her posture, though her hands trembled at her sides.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spencer exited the room in a rush. His jaw was tight as he muttered into his phone, &#34;Pull the theme song right now. I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s the one Paola gave us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rylie walked back to her seat with calm steps. As she passed Brad, his voice rose just loud enough for her to hear. &#34;You&#39;re really going to let her get away with it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her eyes forward but answered smoothly, &#34;Of course not.&#34; Her voice dropped low. &#34;Take a look around. Everyone&#39;s recording. These days, there&#39;s no such thing as keeping a family matter private.&#34;</p>
