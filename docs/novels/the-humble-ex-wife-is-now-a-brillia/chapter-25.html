                <p>&#34;Wait-what did you just say?&#34; Gasps filled the room as everyone stared in disbelief. Calvin Emmett? The country&#39;s most renowned surgeon?The one even the mighty Dawson family couldn&#39;t get an appointment with, no matter how much money or influence they threw around? And now Christina-someone they&#39;d all written off as a washed-up nobody-claimed she could bring him here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon blinked in disbelief. &#34;Hold on. Are we talking about Dr. Emmett? The top cardiac surgeon in the entire country?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina met his gaze without flinching.&#34;Yes.Him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie let out a sharp, disbelieving laugh. &#34;Oh,please. Do you hear yourself? That&#39;s ridiculous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn folded her arms, her tone edged with scorn. &#34;Let&#39;s be real. Even our family couldn&#39;t get through to him, and you think you can? The man&#39;s practically retired!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon gave a mocking laugh. &#34;Christina,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you&#39;ve been out of the game for years. You&#39;ve spent the past few years behind closed doors,reduced yourself to household chores. You don&#39;t have the influence-or the contacts-to pull something like this off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice was calm, but there was steel beneath it. &#34;Who I know and how I get things done isn&#39;t your concern. What matters is-I will bring him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie laughed louder, clutching her stomach.&#34;The arrogance! Do you really expect us to believe you&#39;ve got a direct line to Dr. Emmett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon tilted his head, his expression softening,mockingly so. &#34;Just give King&#39;s treatment opportunity to me, Christina.Save yourself from the humiliation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina hadn&#39;t planned on rising to their bait,but the condescension,smugness, and absolute dismissal in their voices pushed her past silence.She tilted her head slightly,a cold smile playing on her lips. &#34;And what if I do bring him? What then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon rolled his eyes. &#34;You can&#39;t possibly make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s make itinteresting,&#34; Christina said,her voice cool and sure. &#34;A wager.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon raised a brow. &#34;What kind of wager?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile widened. &#34;If I manage to get Dr.Emmett here, every single one of you owes me a public apology-and five million in compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;And if you fail? What then? What if Dr. Emmett doesn&#39;t even step foot here,let alone operate on my grandma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then I&#39;ll forfeit my shot at treatment from the great King-and pay you five million,&#34; Christina said firmly,her tone razor-sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s interest wasn&#39;t in the money. But the chance to claim King&#39;s treatment? That was something else entirely. His heart skipped a beat at the thought. If he won this bet, he could use the treatment opportunity on whoever he pleased-no one could argue against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal.&#34; Brendon agreed without hesitation. He didn&#39;t believe for a second that Christina could pull this off. If the Dawson family, with all their wealth and influence, had failed to reach Dr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emmett,how could Christina possibly succeed?She must be clinging to illusions, still trying to win his attention. Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie exchanged a triumphant glance with her mother, both grinning fromn ear to ear. In their mind, this bet was practically charity. Not only would they earn the five million, but they&#39;d also take the golden ticket to King&#39;s treatment. A double victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Joselyn wasn&#39;t thrilled at the idea of Brendon using King&#39;s treatment on Yolanda.That opportunity was priceless-capable of opening doors, sealing partnerships, and even elevating their family&#39;s position. Squandering it on Yolanda? That was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wasn&#39;t losing sleep over Bethel.She had already analyzed Bethel&#39;s condition during the ride to the hospital. Bethel&#39;s vitals held steady. Her body was still strong and resilient enough to withstand the episode.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Bethel was soon transferred from the emergency room to a VIP suite. Before long,she regained consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once awake, Bethel wasted no time. She sent Katie and Joselyn out of the room, leaving only</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina and Brendon by her bedside. Her voice was soft, but her eyes held a familiar glimmer.&#34;So,you tworeally aren&#39;t getting back together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina offered a warm but cautious smile.&#34;Let&#39;s focus on your recovery. We can talk about everything else later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Bethel wasn&#39;t letting it go. Her brow knit with worry. &#34;No. I need an answer. If I don&#39;t hear it now, I won&#39;t be able to eat or sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon was quick to speak up. &#34;Grandma, I&#39;m sorry for how I&#39;ve acted. I&#39;ve been stubborn, but I&#39;ll think about trying again. Maybe we just need time-to rebuild what we lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel turned to Christina with gentle eyes.&#34;And what about you, dear? If your heart&#39;s not in it, I won&#39;t force you. I just want to see you happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s words made Christina hesitate to announce her lack of intention of getting back at Brendon.Managing a smile, she said, &#34;Maybe a little more time, and things will work out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel gave her hand a warm pat, sensing the hesitation but choosing not to press. &#34;Alright.No matter what happens, you have my full</p>
                
                
                
                <p>support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Christina whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this talk, Christina didn&#39;t walk away.Instead, she stayed by Bethel&#39;s side for hours,quietly keeping her company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Bethel asked Christina to step out for a moment and then gave Brendon a private tongue-lashing.	She	madeit	crystal clear: Yolanda would never be accepted into the family.Ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing better than to argue at this point,Brendon nodded along with everything Bethel said. He wasn&#39;t foolish enough to challenge her in this state. Eventually, he excused himself for a business meeting, leaving Christina to look after Bethel through the rest of the afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only once Bethel had drifted off into a peaceful sleep did Christina quietly slip out,confident the nurses would manage the rest of the night shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Christina stepped out into the crisp evening air, the weight of the day settled on her shoulders. She decided to grab something to eat before heading home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she reached the sidewalk, a black van screeched to a halt in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors burst open, and in seconds, a group of rugged men stormed out, closing in around her like a pack of wolves.</p>
