                <p>Yolanda kept a pleasant smile on her face, but she was scoffing at Katie inwardly. Katie, that fool, actually wanted her help to become Mrs.Hubbard? What a joke. If she ever had a shot at climbing that high, she&#39;d never hand the opportunity to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yolanda, you have to help me,&#34; Katie said,clinging to her arm and giving it a playful shake,completely unaware of the flicker of disdain in Yolanda&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda smiled sweetly and patted Katie&#39;s head.&#34;Don&#39;t worry. If I win the championship, I&#39;ll definitely help you win Mr. Hubbard over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Yolanda! You&#39;re the best!&#34; Katie beamed, resting her head on Yolanda&#39;s shoulder, her face glowing with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Brendon stood quietly, lost in thought. Christina&#39;s smile kept replaying in his mind. Since leaving the Dawson family/,she had changed. The stiffness she once carried was gone-now, she walked with quiet confidence.The image of her dazzling smile made his heart skip a beat. Strange emotions stirred inside him,ones he didn&#39;t fully understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon?&#34; Katie&#39;s brow furrowed. She nudged him and raised her voice. &#34;Brendon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; He blinked, snapping out of his daze.His gaze shifted to the two women. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What were you thinking about? You looked completely zoned out,&#34; Katie asked,watching him closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; he muttered, quickly burying the feelings that had just surfaced. &#34;What were you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said the Hubbard Group is organizing a fashion design competition. Yolanda and I are joining,&#34; Katie replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good,&#34; Brendon said distractedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda noticed the way his mind wandered and clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. It seemed he was thinking about that wretched Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that&#39;s it? No encouragement for us?&#34; Katie teased, nudging him with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you both make it into the top ten, I&#39;ll give you each a hundred thousand,&#34; Brendon said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal!&#34; Katie cheered, flashing a wink at Yolanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda smiled and gently tapped Katie&#39;s forehead. But deep inside, her eyes flashed with fierce determination. She was going to win that championship. That was her chance to get closer to the Hubbard family. The Dawson family was nothing compared to the prestigious Hubbard family. If she could establish a connection with the Hubbards, there was no way she&#39;d stay stuck in the Dawson circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Christina walked into the private room of Morfort Restaurant, Lauretta Gomez, the mother of the child whom Christina had paid the medical bills upfront, and Calvin were already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I&#39;m late,&#34; Christina said with a small,apologetic smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not late at all. We just got here,&#34;Lauretta said warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come, have a seat,&#34; Calvin chimed in,motioning Christina to join them as he began the introductions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her glass of red wine, Lauretta stood up.&#34;Miss Jones, I&#39;d like to toast to you. If it weren&#39;t for you, my son might not have made it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was just good fortune that Dr. Emmett happened to be at the hospital,&#34; Christina said modestly, standing to clink glasses with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even so, I owe you more than words can say,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta said in a sincere voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing her drink, Lauretta turned and toasted Calvin as well. &#34;You both saved my son&#39;s life. I&#39;ll never forget it,&#34; she said, placing two bank cards on the table. &#34;There&#39;s five million in each. It&#39;s just a small token of my appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta had already reimbursed Christina for the hospital costs-this was beyond that. A gesture straight from the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Gomez, that&#39;s far too generous,&#34; Christina said, gently pushing the card back toward her.&#34;I don&#39;t want money. I only have one small favor to ask.&#34;</p>
