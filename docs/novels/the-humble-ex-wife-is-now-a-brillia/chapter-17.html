                <p>Ice crept into Christina&#39;s eyes the instant she recognized the man standing in her path.Without blinking, she leveled her gaze and said,&#34;Step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk. Just for a minute-away from the others,&#34; Brendon said, not budging an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he reached for her hand, Christina pulled back sharply, not even flinching. &#34;What&#39;s stopping you from saying it right here?&#34; she asked, her brow tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shot Davina a look that said more than words and then reached his hand out once more.&#34;Some things are not meant for the ears of the outsiders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not an outsider,&#34; Christina retorted,dodging his reach again. Her eyes were cold as they locked onto his. &#34;Cut the crap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone-calm but sharp-cut deeper than he expected. Being treated this way in public, with eyes possibly watching, left a sour taste in his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spit it out or step aside,&#34; Christina added, her tone sharp and cold. &#34;I have no intention of dealing with your nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange discomfort settled over Brendon. The ink on their divorce certificate hadn&#39;t dried yet,but she had already become so detached and aloof toward him. With a mocking smile, he sneered, &#34;What, no time for me, but you&#39;ve got time to flirt with the Morfort Restaurant&#39;s owner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s nothing improper between me and the owner of the Morfort Restaurant. Whatever you&#39;re imagining says more about you than it does about us,&#34; Christina retorted, her face unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry, bitter laugh spilled from Brendon.&#34;Oh?What&#39;s with the urgent clarification? It seems my words struck a nerve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina let out an exasperated sigh and stepped forward. &#34;This again? Have you even thought before you spew all that nonsense? If you&#39;ve got no point to make, then get out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon cut her a glare, full of irritation. &#34;This</p>
                
                
                
                <p>doesn&#39;t concern you. Stay out of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp snort, Davina folded her arms.&#34;That&#39;s rich coming from you. You two are divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rose in his face, but words refused to follow. He stood there, visibly fuming as he fumbled for words to form a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move, Brendon. We&#39;re done here,&#34; Christina commanded, her voice slicing through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That simple command made him frown.Watching the unwavering look in her eyes, he knew he&#39;d hit a wall if he pressed on.Reluctantly, he decided to change tactics and lied, &#34;My grandma&#39;s been asking about you. She wants us to visit her. Said she misses both of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Not today.&#34; She wasn&#39;t in the mood to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If we keep putting it off, she&#39;s going to start worrying,&#34; Brendon said, trying again, his tone gentler now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Bethel gave Christina pause.Her expression shifted as she considered it, her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brow creasing. Among all the Dawson family members, only Bethel had ever made her feel welcome. Truth be told, Bethel had offered the kind of affection none of the others had. Over time, she had come to see Bethel as her own grandmother. Judging from Brendon&#39;s words,Bethel probably had no clue about their divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I am begging you,&#34; Brendon added, his tone taking on a softer edge. &#34;I just got a call that my grandma&#39;s not doing well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short pause followed before Christina gave a reluctant nod. &#34;Alright.I&#39;ll go. But only to see Bethel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; Brendon replied with a relieved sigh.&#34;I&#39;ve already arranged for a car.We&#39;ll head over together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina, however, wasn&#39;t thriled about Christina going to the Dawson family&#39;s house. But she knew exactly how stubborn Christina could be -once she decided on something,there was no use arguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me you&#39;ll be careful. And if anything feels off, call me right away,&#34; Davina said to Christina,her voice thick with concern. Her eyes then shifted to Brendon, sharp and unforgiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you so much as look at her the wrong way,swear you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon scowled, clearly irritated. &#34;This doesn&#39;t involve you. Stay out of it and mind your own problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah, I will step in the moment you try anything funny,&#34; Davina retorted, clenching her fists so tightly that her knuckles turned white. If she had her way, she&#39;d have decked him right there.What a complete loser. Every inch of him was so infuriatingly annoying. Just the sight of him made her nauseous. Seriously, the Dawson family had some nerve. They&#39;d somehow managed to rope in someone as extraordinary as Christina and trap her in that miserable marriage for three whole years. Without her,Brendon wouldn&#39;t even have registered as average.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a blinding pink sports car skidded to a stop nearby, its engine growling like a beast.A loud whistle followed, garnering everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
