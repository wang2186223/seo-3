                <p>Christina sat beside Davina, her laughter spilling out like a bell, light and easy. She wore confidence like a second skin, and the soft charm in her smile only added to her grace.Already named the winner, she seemed to shine even brighter, effortlessly pulling eyes toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie couldn&#39;t help but see how the spotlight had shifted to Christina. A few of the men were even eyeing Christina with something close to admiration, maybe even respect, and that only stirred her jealousy even more. How did someone like Christina-just an unwanted woman-end up stealing the spotlight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than acknowledge Christina&#39;s talents,Katie clung to the idea that there had to be something shady going on behind the scenes. In her mind, Christina didn&#39;t win on skill and had clearly made some backdoor deal with the shooting range staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve gotta admit, I didn&#39;t expect Christina to pull that off,&#34; Yolanda commented, her tone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>beat Mr. Scott. She&#39;s kind of the star right now isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the words came wrapped in admiration,Yolanda&#39;s glance flicked toward Katie, a spark of mischief behind her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just as Yolanda had expected, Katie snapped, the bitterness sharp in her voice, &#34;Oh,come on! Who knows what kind of strings she pulled to come out on top? A plain nobody like her beating a reigning champ? That doesn&#39;t add up. Bet she slept her way to the championship with the organizers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shifted in his seat, his expression clouding.Her words made it sound like he was cuckolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a bit much,&#34; Yolanda said under her breath, her words calculated to fan the flame while appearing to defend Christina. &#34;Christina doesn&#39;t really seem like that type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie let out a laugh that held no humor. &#34;Don&#39;t be fooled. The second she signed those divorce papers,she started parading around like she was auditioning for attention. Skirts shorter. Makeup bolder. She&#39;s desperate, and everyone knows it _&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katie could spit out more venom,Brendon interjected, &#34;That&#39;s enough. Eat.&#34; His</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tone left no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I&#39;m just telling the truth. Why are you snapping at me like I said something out of line?&#34;Katie retorted, shooting him a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing another chance to make her seem nice,Yolanda reached out and lightly touched Brendon&#39;s sleeve, her voice low and calm as she said, &#34;Brendon, go easy on Katie, will you? She&#39;s still young. She blurts things out without thinking. She&#39;s not trying to hurt anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re always making excuses for her. That&#39;s exactly why she keeps pushing the line,&#34; he said,letting out a quiet sigh, the edge in his voice dulled significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the manager of the Morfort Restaurant stepped into view, commanding instant attention like a ripple through still water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Legends swirled around the establishment&#39;s enigmatic owner-a figure whose reach extended far beyond the polished/walls of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, a haughty noble family had tried to undermine the Morfort Restaukant&#39;s business,mocking its prestige. Predictably, their arrogance was short-lived. Not long after their audacious actions against the Morfort Restaurant, the family&#39;s fortune had crumbled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>their reputation shredded beyond repair A family accustomed to a life of luxury and privilege had failed to handle the downfall-some of them had either committed suicide or gone mad. Those who clung to survival did so on the edge of society-begging, scavenging,shadows of their former selves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Morfort Restaurant&#39;s owner&#39;s identity remained cloaked in secrecy, but everyone knew that the power behind it was not to betrifled with. No one was foolish enough to mess with even the servers, much less the manager. To the guests, the manager wasn&#39;t just a restaurant employee. It was like seeing the trusted envoy of a king.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With elegance in his step and a courteous smile,the manager scanned the hall before proceeding with silent authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| think he&#39;s coming over here,&#34; Yolanda whispered, barely able to contain her anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie was even more thrilled, her eyes fixed on the smiling manager. Could it be that the mysterious owner of the Morfort Restaurant had taken notice of her? And if that were true,mavbe the owner was even on par with Dylan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-or at least close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie was sitting straighter, shoulders back, lips slightly parted. She was ready for the spotlight to find her.</p>
