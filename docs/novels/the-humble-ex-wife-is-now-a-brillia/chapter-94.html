                <p>&#34;Then, thank you,Brendon. Please transfer the ownership of the three properties to me as soon as possible, so you can&#39;t back out later,&#34;Christina said with a faint smile. She paid no mind to Yolanda&#39;s snide remarks. All that mattered to her was getting something real-something in hand. They could talk all they wanted. She couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s expression stayed cold. &#34;Don&#39;t worry.You&#39;ll get what&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s reassuring to hear,&#34; Christina replied calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Christina was unfazed, Calvin was seething. His chest tightened with rage. These fools had kept a medical legend trapped in the role of a housewife for years! Worse, they showed no appreciation for whatever she had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>contributed to the household altogether. If Christina hadn&#39;t preferred to keep her identity as the legendary healer King under wraps, he would&#39;ve revealed the truth and made them regret it for life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pay up now. You lost the five-million bet,&#34;Christina said, eyes locked on Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon glanced at Calvin, who was staring at him intently. Gritting his teeth, he transferred five million to her. &#34;That settles it,&#34; he muttered,barely holding back his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie shot Christina a deadly glare. The frustration in her eyes was plain. To her,Christina was nothing but a blackmailer.What burned more was that there was nothing they could do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda clenched her fists behind her back, her chest tight with bitterness. The house and the money should&#39;ve been hers. But she wasn&#39;t alone in that pain-Brendon and Katie felt like they&#39;d been cut open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologize now as per the bet demands,&#34;Christina said after receiving the money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry. We were wrong. I hope you won&#39;t hold it against us,&#34; Brendon said, lowering his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie wanted to snap, but when she saw Brendon bow, she had to do the same. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have spoken to you like that.Please forgive me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t even look at them properly. Her voice was flat.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her indifference made Katie&#39;s blood boil. But she couldn&#39;t explode-not now. She swallowed her anger, her breathing shaky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, they&#39;ve already apologized. Can&#39;t you just forgive them? We&#39;re not enemies. Why make it worse?&#34; Yolanda stepped in, making another feigned attempt to smooth things over while actually aiming to make Christina look vindictive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just mind your own business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shot her a sharp look of contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s fake smile froze. She hadn&#39;t expected such a blunt response, and it left her utterly humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin, who had remained expressionless till now, quietly gave Christina an approving glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the doors to the emergency room opened. Doctors and nurses began walking out.When they saw Calvin, they stopped in their tracks. Shock and awe crossed their faces.Some opened their mouths but were too stunned to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Emmett!&#34; someone finally cried out, voice shaking with excitement. The others quickly found their voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Emmett, what brings you here?&#34; one asked eagerly, barely containing their excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to check on the patient,&#34; Calvin said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply drew a few curious glances toward Christina. They already knew she was the one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>who invited him here and somehow convinced him to delay surgery for a major figure. It was clear her connection with Calvin was something extraordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the rare chance, one of the doctors hesitated before asking, &#34;Dr. Emmett, I&#39;ve been stuck on a case. Would you have time for a discussion later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin nodded. &#34;Sure. I&#39;ll be around for a few days. If you run into any issues, feel free to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Dr. Emmett!&#34; the doctors beamed,nearly bouncing with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking on Bethel, Calvin turned to Christina.&#34;She&#39;s stable for now. But it&#39;s best not to upset her again. Emotional stress will only slow her recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Christina nodded and then faced Brendon. &#34;You heard him. Stick to your word and leave her in peace until the surgery.&#34;</p>
