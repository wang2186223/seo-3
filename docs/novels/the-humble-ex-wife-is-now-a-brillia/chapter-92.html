                <p>Katie,Brendon,and Yolanda jumped,startled by the sudden voice behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie spun around, fuming. She didn&#39;t even check who it was before snapping,&#34;You nosy old geezer! Can&#39;t you just mind your own damned business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t done yet and was about to hurl more insults when Brendon&#39;s cold voice cut in. &#34;Shut up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie clamped her mouth shut, shooting a glare at the energetic old man. Something about him felt familiar, like she&#39;d seen him before. But her thoughts were cut short when Brendon spoke up respectfully. &#34;Dr. Emmett, my sister meant no harm. I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he threw Katie a warning glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie froze and then stammered, &#34;I-I&#39;m sorry,Dr. Emmett. I didn&#39;t mean what I said. Please don&#39;t take it to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dr. Emmett. I didn&#39;t mean what I said. Please don&#39;t take it to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin snorted, his voice laced with sarcasm.&#34;An apology? An old geezer like me is not worthy of such grand gestures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re truly sorry, Dr. Emmett,&#34; Brendon said,his brows drawn with worry. His tone was sincere,his posture humble. He clearly didn&#39;t want to offend Calvin. After all, even the biggest families in Lorbridge wouldn&#39;t dare step on Calvin&#39;s toes-let alone he.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| really just spoke without thinking. Please forgive me, Dr. Emmett. I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; Katie added quickly, her voice tight with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda stepped forward, her voice calm and sweet. &#34;Dr. Emmett, you&#39;re a man of great standing. Surely you wouldn&#39;t hold a grudge against someone so young and impulsive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin sneered and gave her a sideways glance.&#34;Spare me the sweet talk. I&#39;m petty-l&#39;d hold a grudge against even a newborn.&#34;1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda was left speechless. The awkwardness was palpable. This wasn&#39;t the Calvin she&#39;d heard about. His reputation didn&#39;t match the man</p>
                
                
                
                <p>standing before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Off to the side, Christina&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile as she discreetly gave Calvin a thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin noticed and lifted his chin slightly, a flash of pride in his eyes. Then, he leaned into his arrogance as he shifted his gaze back to Katie and the others, his eyes tinged with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie fumed inside. She wanted to lash out but knew better. She couldn&#39;t afford to offend Calvin. If Calvin struck back, the Dawson family wouldn&#39;t stand a chance. She swallowed her pride and forced an apologetic look. &#34;Dr.Emmett, I truly understand my mistake. Please forgive me this once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brendon spoke up. &#34;Dr.Emmett, were you invited here by Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to steer the conversation and fish for answers. If Christina had indeed invited Calvin here, maybe there was still hope to salvage the situation. Perhaps he could even seize the opportunity to build a connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Calvin replied coolly, his sharp eyes scanning Brendon. The tone Brendon</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mentioned Christina-was there something between them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie,Brendon,and Yolanda stiffened in shock at Calvin&#39;s words. Christina had actually invited Calvin!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon was the first to recover. He let out a quiet breath, slightly relieved. Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a disaster after all. If he played it right, this could work in his favor-even though he lost the bet. He stepped forward.	&#34;My grandmother&#39;s been sick, and Christina&#39;s been doing everything to take care of her. Christina is an amazing wife. I&#39;m truly grateful for everything she&#39;s done for my family...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin&#39;s brows knit together. Wife? Christina had never said she was married. And judging by how these three treated her, something felt off.Turning to Christina, he asked, &#34;Is he your husband?&#34;</p>
