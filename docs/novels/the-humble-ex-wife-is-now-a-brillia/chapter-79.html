                <p>A middle-aged man in his fifties stepped forward,his face sharp with authority as he scanned Christina from head to toe.&#34;How dare you,young lady, call Dr. Emmett by his full name?&#34; he scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the man looked closer and saw how young Christina was, his anger eased a little. She probably didn&#39;t know any better. Still, he didn&#39;t like her tone. Not one bit. This was Calvin they were talking about-one of the world&#39;s most respected surgeons. Even now, his hands worked with the steady precision of a master.When it came to craniotomies, no one could match him.He was a living legend. Admired. Respected.Idolized by doctors across the globe. For many in the medical world, just seeing Calvin once was a lifelong dream. To learn from him-even the smallest bit of wisdom-was an honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be the director, Mr. Johan Duffy,&#34;Christina said with a calm smile,meeting his gaze without flinching.&#34;Good day,Mr.Duffy.I&#39;d like to meet Dr.Emmett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, the two bodyguards had her firmly in their grip. But she remnained calm, still smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan raised a brow, slightly surprised. She had guts. Maybe it was just youthful boldness.Something about her coolness impressed him.Still, he couldn&#39;t say he liked her approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept over her again, stern as ever.Then, Christina bent her knees and began to sway gently, using the bodyguards like a pair of swing posts and smiling like she was enjoying herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan was so caught off guard that he nearly laughed out loud. She reminded him of his granddaughter-the same playful spirit, the same spark in her eyes. His impression of her softened,just a little. But he didn&#39;t drop his stern tone. &#34;Dr.Emmett doesn&#39;t see visitors. You should leave at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina swung a little harder. &#34;No. I must see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards exchanged exasperated looks. If they had known she&#39;d turn them into swing posts,they wouldn&#39;t have hold her in the first place.She looked like she was having a grand old time,though it was a serious test of their arm strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan sighed.&#34;Young lady,are you not listening?Dr. Emmett is very busy. You can&#39;t just demand to see him. He doesn&#39;t have time for random visitors.&#34; He waved a hand at the bodyguards.&#34;Take her back to the elevator.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was already an unusually polite order coming from Johan. Normally, he&#39;d have ordered the bodyguards to toss someone like her out without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards turned Christina around and began escorting her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see Dr. Emmett!&#34; Christina shouted.&#34;Calvin! Calvin Emmett! Calv-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep voice cut through the hallway like a thunderclap. &#34;Wait!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone froze.It was Calvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes lit up, and a bright smile spread across her face. She had planned to act out and force her way through if Calvin didn&#39;t show up.But now that Calvin had appeared, things were much simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Emmett! I am here! Help me! Please save me!&#34; Christina cried out, pretending to struggle in their arip.Calvin immediately recognized the voice-it was none other than the legendary healer, King! His heart leapt into his throat. &#34;Let go! Let go of her right now!&#34; he shouted, rushing forward so fast that he nearly lost his footing. He looked ready to shove the bodyguards out of the way himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin was flustered. If they offended King,how could he ever hope to learn from her? If there was only one miracle worker left in the world-it was her.He couldn&#39;t afford to anger her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan and the bodyguards stood frozen in shock,staring at the man they thought they knew. Was this really Calvin? The calm, noble surgeon who always carried himself like a king? Now, he looked like a desperate grandfather ready to throw punches for his beloved granddaughter.</p>
