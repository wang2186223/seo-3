                <p>Finnegan spun to face Joselyn, his voice sharp with disbelief. &#34;Mrs. Dawson, this woman just insulted your son-and you&#39;re honestly going to let that go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina Jones!&#34; Joselyn hissed, her words trembling with a volatile mix of shame and anger.She jabbed an unsteady finger at Christina, her eyes wild. &#34;You fucking bitch! One more word out of you, and I&#39;ll snuff that mouth of yours permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina exhaled, the sound thick with mocking exhaustion. &#34;Alas! Guess I really am a hopeless case,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s lips twisted into a venomous smirk.&#34;What&#39;s this? Finally smartened up and realized you&#39;re just a loser?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile turned languid, almost lazy, her eyes radiating an icy indifference. &#34;I just realized that no matter how hard I fall, I can&#39;t even get close to the bottomless pit of shamelessness of you guys. Honestly, I&#39;m impressed. I could never</p>
                
                
                
                <p>compete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage swept through the group, every face twisted with indignation, each of them looking ready to throttle Christina right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda pushed forward, her eyes glistening with theatrical misery. &#34;Christina, if you&#39;re angry-if you have some grudge-then take it out on me.Please, just leave the Dawson family out of it.I can shoulder it all,&#34; she pleaded, her voice trembling as if she might break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s gaze flicked to Yolanda, cold and contemptuous. She didn&#39;t bother with words-a single withering look was enough to send Yolanda reeling back, panic flashing across her face as she nearly toppled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn and Katie hurried to Yolanda&#39;s side, their faces knotted with worry as they hovered over her, fussing and whispering anxious questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole performance was so absurd that Christina nearly let out a laugh. All she&#39;d done was look at Yolanda, yet these women acted as if she&#39;d pulled a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila&#39;s voice rang out, cold and shrill. &#34;How could you be so vicious? The Dawson family once welcomed you as one of their own. Is this what</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you do-get divorced and start flinging insults?You even insulted your ex-husband! Don&#39;t you have a shred of decency left? The Dawsons treated you well, but now you&#39;re out here smearing their name just for spite. Showing no respect to your elders-aren&#39;t you afraid of what that might bring?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s gaze, languid and unbothered, slid over to Sheila as she took an unhurried step forward. Sheila immediately shrank back, fear flashing in her eyes for a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Sheila felt as if Christina&#39;s cool,razor-sharp stare had sliced straight through her,laying bare every secret she&#39;d ever tried to hide.She couldn&#39;t breathe-her throat seemed to tighten under that icy scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow, crooked smile, Christina spoke,her voice laced with mockery. &#34;Interesting. No wonder you all get along so well-your private lives are just as messy as your gossip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila&#39;s complexion went ghostly pale, but she quickly composed herself, forcing a sneer. &#34;Ha!Stop slandering me. Word is, you&#39;re just the Jones family&#39;s charity case-some adopte nobody, parents unknown. If anyone here is illegitimate, Christina, it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan&#39;s face turned an ominous shade as he jabbed a finger in Christina&#39;s direction, his voice thundering. &#34;What bullshit are you spewing?Every Mitchell child has a paternity report-they&#39;re all mine! Keep talking and I&#39;ll drag you to court for slander!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t even flinch. &#34;By all means, try it,&#34;she replied aloofly, a sly, mocking smile tugging at her lips. Her gaze cut straight through Finnegan and Sheila, ice-cold and unyielding. &#34;But let&#39;s not kid ourselves-at least one of you isn&#39;t related to your kids by blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across both Finnegan&#39;s and Sheila&#39;s faces, though Finnegan&#39;s temper snapped first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You goddamn piece of scum! I&#39;ll shut that mouth of yours for good!&#34; Finnegan snapped, storming toward Christina with murder in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s voice trembled as she called out,&#34;Dad,please-don&#39;t get upset!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she made no effort to intervene, secretly wishing he&#39;d hurt Christina. If he landed a blow the most they&#39;d have to do was pay some hush money-nothing truly damaging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda had always dealt with her victims the same way-crush them and then toss them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>scraps. To her, the poor were pitiful creatures, too desperate to chase justice once money entered the picture. In her eyes, poverty itself was a crime -one she had no intention of forgiving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers gathered, anticipation flickering in their eyes, waiting for Christina to be humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the split second before Finnegan&#39;s foot could land, Christina slipped nimbly aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan&#39;s leg whipped through empty air, his own momentum pitching him forward. With a sickening thud, he crashed onto the floor, the room reverberating with the impact. A pained groan slipped from his lips as he lay sprawNled and unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group, who moments before looked eager for violence, blanched at the sudden turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad!&#34; Yolanda shrieked, bolting to his side,her face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan shifted ever so slightly, and the collective tension in the room broke-their relief as palpable as their shock. He hadn&#39;t died from the fall, but the spectacle they&#39;d expected had shattered in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda immediately burst into tears, her sobs</p>
                
                
                
                <p>echoing through the room. &#34;Dad! Dad, say something-please, don&#39;t scare me like this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yol...&#34; Finnegan tried to speak, but Yolanda threw him a sharp,warning look-an unspoken cue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on, Finnegan obediently let his hand flop to the floor, squeezing his eyes shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, answer me! What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34;Yolanda wailed, wringing her hands in theatrical distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila&#39;s voice rang out, shrill and panicked.&#34;Darling! Please, don&#39;t do this-don&#39;t leave me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn rushed over, her tone pitched high with alarm. &#34;Mr.Mitchell! Wake up-please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into overlapping cries, the chaos sharp enough to rattle the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie whipped around, her wrath fixed on Christina. &#34;This is all your fault, Christina! Look what you&#39;ve done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina lounged against the wall, arms raised in a lazy stretch. &#34;And what exactly does this have to do with me?&#34; she drawled, unfazed by the hysteria.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If anything happens to Mr. Mitchell, we&#39;ll mane</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you pay!&#34; Katie spat, her glare seething with accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina met her glare with a faint, dismissive smile. &#34;You&#39;re really blaming me? He fell over his own feet-how&#39;s that my fault?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all on you!&#34; Katie bellowed, her voice sharp as a slap. &#34;You have to take full responsibility!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet chuckle slipped from Christina&#39;s lips. &#34;Let me get this straight: you think I should&#39;ve just stood there and let him try to kick me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shot Katie a look, her eyes cool and fearless. That kick had been meant to put her in the hospital,maybe worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie crossed her arms, refusing to back down. &#34;If you hadn&#39;t dodged, would he even have fallen?You&#39;re young. It&#39;s not like you would die from a kick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina arched a brow and gave a sly, taunting grin. &#34;If you&#39;re so sure, why don&#39;t you stand right there and let me kick you to test that theory?&#34;</p>
