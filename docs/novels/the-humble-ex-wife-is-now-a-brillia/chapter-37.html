                <p>&#34;No matter how things turn out, it&#39;s always worth trying,&#34; Chloe said with a gentle smile. Her face was glowing, but the weakness in her body still showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If even King can&#39;t heal me, then I doubt anyone else can,&#34; Chloe added quietly. King was her last thread of hope. She knew that clinging to expectations could be dangerous, but letting go felt even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be fine. King is one of the best,&#34; Dylan said firmly as if trying to convince both her and himself. King was their last hope. He couldn&#39;t imagine what would happen if that hope disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe leaned forward, resting her chin in her hands. Her eyes sparkled brightly, full of curiosity.Even though she looked tired and pale, her charm and youthful spirit still shone through. &#34;I wonder what King is like. A man or a woman? Old or young? I&#39;d love to meet King someday,&#34; she said with a hopeful look in her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s such a pity l</p>
                
                
                
                <p>don&#39;t have any talent for medicine. Otherwise, if l ever got the chance to meet King, I&#39;d beg to become their apprentice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan arched an eyebrow and slid a bowl of soup in front of her. &#34;You&#39;d be wasting your breath,&#34; he said with a smile. &#34;King doesn&#39;t take on apprentices.Now eat before it gets cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe wrinkled her nose, stuck her tongue out at him, and then turned excitedly toward Christina.&#34;Christina! You have to try this!&#34; she said, her tone bubbling with enthusiasm. &#34;Dylan made it,and it&#39;s honestly amazing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina smiled and picked up her spoon, giving in to Chloe&#39;s cheerful persistence. The aroma alone was rich and comforting, and the first sip stunned her. The broth was deep and flavorful-savory, slow-cooked, and full of warmth.It tasted like something that had simmered for hours,layered with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked, caught off guard. It had been years since she&#39;d tasted soup this top-notch. If she hadn&#39;t seen Dylan in the kitchen herself, she would never have believed he could cook this remarkablv.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory surfaced vividly-it was during a prestigious cooking competition where she&#39;d served as one of the anonymous judges. The winning dish? A bowl of onion soup that had left a lasting impression on her palate. And this one...tasted exactly the same. Not just similar-identical, down to the subtle depth of flavor and the delicate balance of spices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, the competition had been shrouded in secrecy. Contestants competed under codenames, their identities hidden. No one revealed their faces-not even the judges.Everyone remained a mystery, known only by their assigned numbers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had been the rule of the competition-strict anonymity. To this day, no one knew the true identities of the champion chef or the judges. All that was certain was that the juddges had been carefully selected by the organizers-big names in the culinary world, each carrying serious weight in the industry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she remembered correctly, the winner had competed under the codename Blaine. When Blaine first entered the contest, few had paid attention. The name didn&#39;t carry weight, and the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>presentation had been modest. Almost no one placed bets on Blaine, assuming Blaine would be eliminated early, certainly not someone to make it to the top three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina had gone against popular opinion.Something about Blaine&#39;s first dish had caught her attention, and she&#39;d quietly placed her bet on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone&#39;s surprise, Blaine had swept the competition and claimed the championship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Christina had been Judge Number 6.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, as Christina tasted the soup Dylan had made, a wild thought passed through her mind-could he be Blaine? But then she shook it off. Dylan was the head of the powerful Scott Group. He was a business mogul,constantly in the spotlight. There was no way he would&#39;ve had the time-or interest-to enter a secret cooking competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it good?&#34; Chloe asked eagerly, watching Christina&#39;s reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded, still savoring the flavor. &#34;It&#39;s more than good. It&#39;s incredible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe beamed, &#34;Dylan seldom cooks. Even our family rarely gets to taste his food. His cooking skills are reserved for his future wife,&#34; she teased,shooting Christina a playful look. &#34;I only get to enjoy it today because you&#39;re here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Chloe leaned in closer, eyes sparkling with mischief. &#34;Christina, have you ever considered becoming my sister-in-law?&#34; she said with a grin.&#34;Just imagine it! Dylan is cooking for you every day, trying new recipes, and making all your favorite dishes. He&#39;s really amazing in the kitchen.Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t mind being the third wheel if it means I get to eat, too. Think about it. He&#39;s tall and handsome, cooks like a pro, and absolutely spoils the people he loves. In our family, the men are loyal to the core and treat their wives like queens.&#34;</p>
