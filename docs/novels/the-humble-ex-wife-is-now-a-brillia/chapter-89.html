                <p>With a gentle squeeze, Yolanda took Katie&#39;s hand and spoke softly, her words carefully chosen to make her appear understandable while subtly pissed Katie off. &#34;Katie, please don&#39;t make a scene. Let&#39;s listen to your grandmother, okay? Christina&#39;s done so much for your grandmother. After all that care and patience she&#39;s shown, it&#39;s only fair for your grandmother to repay her somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s fear faded in an instant, swept away by a surge of anger. Witnessing Bethel&#39;s affection for Christina felt like a slap. How could an outsider earn more love from her grandmother than her,the granddaughter by blood? The sting of jealousy replaced every ounce of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| won&#39;t stand for this!&#34; Katie shouted, yanking her hand free from Yolanda&#39;s grasp. &#34;Why should I just accept this?&#34; With trembling hands, she jabbed a finger at Christina. &#34;She&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>not even family! What gives her the right to inherit the Dawson estate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp crack sounded as Bethel&#39;s palm slammed down on the table, her voice ringing out with authority. &#34;Because the property is in my name. That means I get to decide who receives it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping in before the moment escalated,Christina gently reached for Bethel&#39;s hand.&#34;Bethel, please-don&#39;t hurt your hand like that.It isn&#39;t worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Bethel&#39;s stormy expression softened,a warm smile breaking through as she turned to Christina. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about me, sweetheart.I&#39;m not hurt at all. You&#39;re the only one who truly cares how I feel,&#34; she said, casting a sharp glance at her grandchildren. &#34;Unlike certain people in this family who&#39;ve forgotten the meaning of gratitude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his place at the side, Brendon felt his irritation mounting. To him, it seemed like</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina was more of a grandchild to Bethel than he or Katie ever was. He couldn&#39;t stay quiet anymore. &#34;Grandma, even if the deed is in your name, the house is part of the Dawson family legacy. Let&#39;s face it-most of the family members will never accept what you&#39;re trying to do. Plus, you don&#39;t have much time left. Just rest in the hospital until death claims you. Don&#39;t wield your position as the matriarch just to cause chaos inside the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s bluntness hit Bethel like a slap,leaving her speechless. Disbelief filled her gaze,and tears threatened as anger mingled with heartbreak, an ache settling in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s got a point, Grandma. You have no business giving away what belongs to the Dawson family.&#34; Katie seized the chance to pile on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word from Katie was cold and calculated,her eyes void of concern for Bethel&#39;s feelings.All she cared about was keeping the estate out of Christina&#39;s hands. If her grandfather hadn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>made the mistake of placing nearly all the company shares, the Dawson estate, and a handful of other properties in Bethel&#39;s hands,neither she nor Brendon would be forced to bow to Bethel. So what if Bethel was their grandmother? The Dawson family&#39;s assets would never go to an outsider. Now, in her old age, Bethel astonished them by abruptly deciding to transfer the Dawson estate to Christina. What an old fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s eyes glistened red as she looked long and hard at her grandchildren, a bitter smile touching her lips. In the past, she had adored Katie and Brendon, shielding them from every hardship as they grew. She had treated them like priceless treasures, making sure they lacked for nothing. Yet, all that love seemed to have been wasted on hearts grown cold.With every passing year, their rebellion had only deepened. The more she tried to rein them in,the more defiant they became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie had always tested Bethel&#39;s patience the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>most. Time and again, Bethel had been forced to clean up the messes. Their relationship never recovered from the day Katie had bullied a classmate so badly that the poor soul&#39;s arm was broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel herself had insisted on taking Katie to the police, prioritizing what was right over family bond, even if it meant ruining their relationship.After her release, Katie had barely exchanged a word with Bethel. Whenever their paths crossed, Katie often turned away, choosing to avoid Bethel entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accusations had followed-whispers that Bethel lacked warmth, that she was cold to her own blood. Was that the truth? All she ever wanted was for her grandchildren to stay on the right track.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry, humorless chuckle escaped Bethel. Both Katie&#39;s and Brendon&#39;s words stung deeply.Decades of her life had gone into the Dawson family, her energy spent keeping their fortunes and reputation afloat. Even as the years</p>
                
                
                
                <p>weighed her down, she had carried every responsibility, worried her pampered descendants would falter without her steady hand. All those sacrifices-the late nights, the constant stress, the toll on her condition-were now dismissed with their cruel words.Everything she had done was for them to lead a privileged life, yet here she was, receiving anything but due respect and gratitude.Sadness and disappointment settled over her like a heavy shroud, making it hard to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tightness gripped Bethel&#39;s chest, the ache radiating down her arms and into her fingers,each breath a struggle against a pain that threatened to swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden wave of agony hit. Bethel&#39;s hand flew to her chest, her features twisting in pain.Her vision blurred, and within seconds, she crumpled to the floor, helpless.</p>
