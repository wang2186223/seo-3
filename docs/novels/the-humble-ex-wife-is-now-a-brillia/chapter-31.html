                <p>Dylan pulled Christina into his arms, shielding her from the violent scene behind them. He turned slightly, making sure her eyes wouldn&#39;t catch the bloodshed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, lifting his gaze to his men, his expression hardened-sharp, cold, and commanding. The air around him grew heavy, his presence alone sending a chill through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clean it up. Not a single trace left behind,&#34; Dylan ordered, his voice low but lethal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; His subordinates responded without hesitation, moving swiftly to carry out his command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding Christina close, Dylan walked away with the quiet authority of a man born to lead. His powerful presence radiated through the room,making everyone instinctively step back. His eyes, frigid and razor-sharp, could pierce straight through a person&#39;s soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina leaned against his chest, taking in the warmth of his embrace. Her gaze wandered up to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his strong jawline and sculpted features.Everything about him was impossibly perfect-handsome, yes, but more than that,magnetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll stop by the hospital later for a check-up,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stirred. &#34;It&#39;s just a small scratch. No need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down at her, and the chill in his eyes melted.&#34;Better to check it anyway. Otherwise, I won&#39;t be at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fleeting warmth in his gaze made her heart falter. It wasn&#39;t just his looks. It was the way he carried himself, how his quiet concern made her feel unexpectedly safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she didn&#39;t respond right away, Dylan misread her silence. His voice dropped, coaxing,tender in a way only she ever got to hear. &#34;Please.Just do it for me. A scrape might be minor to you,but to me, it&#39;s a big deal. We&#39;re sort of business partners. That means your safety is my responsibility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina felt a gentle warmth bloom within her.Though they were merely partners, Dylan&#39;s concern was undeniably genuine. &#34;Alright,&#34; she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>murmured, giving a smail nod. Brendon hadn&#39;t even acknowledged her bleeding wound, while Dylan, merely a business partner, couldn&#39;t bear to ignore even the smallest scrape on her skin.One didn&#39;t need to love someone to show basic care.But Brendon hadn&#39;t shown even that.People were so very different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they approached the car, Christina shifted,glancing up at him. &#34;You can put me down now.I can get in on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan respected her words, gently lowering her to the ground. &#34;Okay. Just take it slow,&#34; he said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; she assured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as her feet touched the pavement and she bent to enter the car, a sharp jolt of pain shot through her skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah-&#34; Christina gasped, her brows knitting in agony. She had brushed it off as minor, but her vision dimmed abruptly, and before she could react,her body gave out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one swift, fluid motion, Dylan caught her in his arms. He exhaled quietly, relieved she hadn&#39;t hit the ground-but the worry etched on his face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina?&#34; he called out, his voice firm but laced with tension. No response. Panic flickered in his eyes as he quickly checked for signs of life-her breath, her pulse. Steady. Thank God.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the knot in his chest wouldn&#39;t loosen.Something wasn&#39;t right, and that gnawing unease refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Dylan lifted her again and gently laid her in the back seat of the car.He shrugged off his tailored suit jacket and placed it over her, tucking it in with care. His brow was furrowed, his usual icy calm disrupted by the storm of worry behind his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, having watched the scene unfold,sat frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In all the years he had worked for Dylan, never-not once-had he seen Dylan break his rules,especially not for a woman. And yet, here he was,treating Christina like she was the only person in the world that mattered.</p>
