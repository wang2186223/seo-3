                <p>Dylan rushed forward and caught Christina just in time, steadying her as her high heel snagged on the step. One arm wrapped around her waist, their faces only inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina clung to Dylan, arms looped tightly around his neck, her body slightly tilted balanced only by his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked, and for a moment, it felt like their noses might brush. Warm breath passed between them, only occasionally broken by the whisper of a passing breeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft gust lifted a few loose strands of Christina&#39;s hair, brushing them gently across her flushed cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint scent of wine lingered on her breath, mixing with her natural fragrance into something delicate, intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the wine on her breath-or</p>
                
                
                
                <p>maybe something more-but Dylan felt lightheaded, his breathing unsteady. Her skin glowed under the light, and up close, every feature of her face seemed impossibly beautiful. He couldn&#39;t tear his eyes off her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thump. Thump. Christina couldn&#39;t tell whose heartbeat echoed louder-hers or his-but one thing was certain: Dylan looked devastatingly dashing up close. &#34;Has anyone ever told you how ridiculously handsome you are?&#34; she asked with a playful smile, her voice low and unguarded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan didn&#39;t answer right away. His exporession remained stoic, lips pressed into a firm line as he gazed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the poker face all the time? Come on,smile a little,&#34; she teased, lifting a hand and gently poking the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The edge of Dylan&#39;s mouth lifted into a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There it is. You look even better when you smile,&#34; Christina beamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was the alcohol talking, but something about him made her bolder, more curious. She leaned in a little closer, drawing in a breath. &#34;You smell amazing,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan blinked.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, you smell amazing,&#34; she repeated,laughing softly as she buried her face in the curve of his neck and breathed him in again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scent was warm and clean, addictive.It wrapped around her like a spell. Something stirred inside her, deep and sudden-like a restlessness she couldn&#39;t quite suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nose grazed his neck, cold against his skin, and the contrast made his body stiffen.A shiver ran through him, and his Adam&#39;s apple bobbed as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air between them thickened, heated by their closeness and quiet breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desire coiled inside Dylan, sharp and sudden, dangerously hard to ignore. He inhaled deeply, trying to steady himself.His</p>
                
                
                
                <p>voice was rough as he finally spoke. &#34;You&#39;ve had too much to drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not drunk,&#34; Christina whispered, eyes gleaming with mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Dylan started, but she cut him off with a soft press of her finger against his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh.&#34; Her smile deepened. &#34;I&#39;m really not drunk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t lying. Tipsy, yes. But not drunk.Just bold, curious, and fearlessly drawn to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan stared at her, thrown off balance. A resigned smile touched his lips. A tipsy Christina was even more endearing than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t believe me?&#34; she asked, tilting her head,studying his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you,&#34; Dylan said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look like you believe me.&#34; She scrunched her nose and leaned forward,pressing her forehead against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan tensed again. His hand at her waist tightened as their closeness pushed him to the edge. Her touch. Her warmth.Her scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll show you I&#39;m not drunk,&#34; she said, pulling back just enough to meet his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; he asked, voice husky, throat tightening, his Adam&#39;s apple rising once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s lips curled into a slow, teasing smile as she leaned in, inch by inch, closing the space between them.</p>
