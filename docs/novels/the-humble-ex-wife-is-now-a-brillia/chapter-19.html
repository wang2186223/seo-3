                <p>Christina saw no point in offering explanations.Brendon had already passed judgment, so nothing she said would matter. With a shrug, she said purposely, &#34;I am exactly what you think lam.How&#39;s that concerned you? After all, you&#39;re just my ex-husband now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered on the words &#34;ex-husband,&#34; letting each syllable slice through the tension like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of denial, her unapologetic admission threw Brendon off,and his features twisted with anger at her blunt dismissal. &#34;You&#39;re free to do whatever you like now, but were you already sleeping around while we were still married?&#34; he demanded,voice raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold chuckle slipped from Christina&#39;s lips.&#34;That&#39;s rich coming from you. If you want answers about my loyalty during our marriage,I can ask you the same question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon retorted, &#34;I never cheated on you-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>when did I ever step out on our marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes, the sound of her laughter bitter. &#34;Come off it. Even with a ring on your finger,your heart always belonged to someone else.&#34; Her gaze flicked to Yolanda, a hint of scorn curling at her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s voice trembled with mock regret.&#34;Christina, I... I&#39;m sorry...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, Brendon reached over and took Yolanda&#39;s hand, his expression softening for her.He faced Christina again, voice turning cold and matter-of-fact. &#34;Yes, I never loved you. This marriage was forced on me, and I admit l treated you poorly these last years. But wasn&#39;t the settlement I gave you enough? You got more out of this divorce than most could hope to make in a lifetime. Three years, and now you&#39;ll never have to worry about money. Most people would kill for that kind of deal. Christina,I owe you nothing.Yolanda doesn&#39;t owe you,either. The real mistake here was this marriage -it never should&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, cold laugh slipped from Christina.&#34;So,you think I owe you and Yolanda? You claimed this whole marriage was some grand mistake?But you could have saved us both the trouble</p>
                
                
                
                <p>by simply not proposing in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Brendon given even a hint of hesitation before their wedding day, Christina never would have said yes. All along, Brendon&#39;s choices revealed his selfishness. After Yolanda left him shattered three years back with the abrupt departure overseas, he had grabbed her as a substitute to fill the void, especially given that she had been there to take care of his wounds left by the accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My grandmother pushed me into marrying you,&#34;Brendon said, brows drawn in irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Christina&#39;s voice held a mocking edge. &#34;Funny, I don&#39;t remember you putting up any kind of fight. Pressure or not, you had options. You just didn&#39;t use them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t exactly refuse! Not marrying you would&#39;ve meant losing my place in the company,&#34;Brendon retorted, exasperation creeping in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So much for true love. It falls apart as soon as your bottom line is threatened,&#34; Christina said,her words dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie suddenly barged into the conversation,bristling with indignation. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to mean? Quit trying to sow discord here!Yolanda and Brendon are perfectly happy together, and your spiteful comments won&#39;t change a thing. Don&#39;t fool yourself-Brendon isn&#39;t coming back to you, and you can forget about ever remarrying into the Dawson family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glacial chill settled over Christina&#39;s features.&#34;You read too much into it. Even if the entire Dawson family came crawling, I wouldn&#39;t rejoin them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s laugh was sharp and derisive. &#34;Oh,come on! Don&#39;t flatter yourself. No one in my family wants you back. With your reputation for fickle and shamelessness, you&#39;re nothing but trouble -no respectable family would take the risk.Forget about high society. Even average people wouldn&#39;t want you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice glinted in Christina&#39;s eyes as she fixed her stare on Katie. &#34;You might as well worry about your own skeletons. Wouldn&#39;t want a few nasty secrets ruining your shot at marrying up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush of panic washed over Katie. &#34;My skeletons? What are you talking about?&#34; Her voice faltered, eyes darting away from Christina&#39;s gaze as unease flashed across her face. Facing Christina always unsettled her,leaving her with the unsettling sensethat nothing could be hidden from those sharp eyes.</p>
