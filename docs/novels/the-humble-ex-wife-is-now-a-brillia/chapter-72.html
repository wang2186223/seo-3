                <p>The doctor delivered the news that Chloe&#39;s condition had taken a turn for the worse. The brain tumor was now pressing against her optic nerve, causing episodes of temporary blindness. Even after the temporary blindness faded, her vision remained blurry, eventually leading to complete blindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the tumor had been in a safer location,surgery might have saved her. Her chances of recovery could have been high. But the tumor&#39;s position made everything more complicated. It was dangerously close to critical areas of the brain, making the operation nearly impossible.Even the most experienced surgeons were hesitant, their hands tied by the risks involved.On the operating table, Chloe&#39;s chances of surviving were heartbreakingly low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, without surgery, the doctors said she might only live another six months-or a year if lucky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if her health declined suddenly, she might not even live to see the next day. There was no way to predict what might happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After explaining everything and giving a few instructions, the doctor and nurse quietly stepped out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was heavy. No one spoke. All eyes turned to Chloe. She sat calmly,her gaze unfocused. Wrapped in a blanket of darkness, she couldn&#39;t seethe walls, the light,or the faces around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy looked at her pale face and lifeless eyes.Her lips were dry, her skin fragile. But still, she smiled. That smile tore something inside him. It made his chest ache with sympathy and concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is everyone so quiet?&#34; Chloe asked softly,a faint smile on her lips. She reached out,her hands searching the air around her. &#34;Where are you all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were blank but strangely peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soft curve of her smile was both beautiful and heartbreaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stepped forward quickly, gently wrapping her fingers around Chloe&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm... Small hands,&#34; Chloe said, tilting her head. &#34;That must be Christina, right?&#34; A laugh escaped her lips. &#34;Did I guess right? I&#39;m kind of amazing, aren&#39;t l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was brighter now, trying to cut through the sadness hanging in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she couldn&#39;t see their faces, she could feel their emotions-and she wanted to comfort them. She didn&#39;t want those she loved to be sad. More than anything, she wanted them to be happy. Even if she couldn&#39;t escape death,she hoped those she cared about would live joyful,fulfilling lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina smiled. &#34;Yes, Chloe. You&#39;re really amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina lifted her hand as if to pat Chloe&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>head gently, but in truth, she was quietly checking Chloe&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the others?&#34; Chloe asked with a gentle smile, tilting her head slightly. Her vacant eyes were fixed on a spot in the room.&#34;Why isn&#39;t anyone saying anything?&#34; She had heard voices earlier from that direction, so she guessed they were all standing there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re right here,&#34; Ralphy replied, trying his best to keep his voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You will be fine. Nothing will happen to you,&#34;Dylan said firmly, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right,&#34; Morse chimed in. &#34;King&#39;s almost done preparing the medicine. Soon, you&#39;ll be able to see the world again-its colors, its beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s smile deepened, but her voice turned wistful. &#34;Speaking of which, I suddenly want to see the ocean. Snow-covered mountains.Waterfalls. Even the aurora.&#34; She paused.&#34;There&#39;s still so much I haven&#39;t seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, fear was curling up inside her.What if she never got to see those things and taste her favorite foods again? But she refused to show her fear. She didn&#39;t want the people she loved to worry. So, she masked her anxiety with a soft smile and steady voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan,&#34; Chloe said softly, &#34;I want to eat your cooking again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A warm smile spread across Dylan&#39;s face.&#34;Anything you want. Just name it, and I&#39;ll make it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe folded her arms wwith a proud huff. &#34;Well,at least this illness comes with one perk-l get pampered like a queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan frowned a little, his tone shifting.&#34;Chloe...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grinned, sticking out her tongue playfully.&#34;Relax, I&#39;m only joking! Don&#39;t take everything SO seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still smiling, she reached out slowly, searching</p>
                
                
                
                <p>for Christina&#39;s hand. &#34;Christina...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of soft, warm hands wrapped gently around Chloe&#39;s. &#34;I&#39;m here,&#34; Christina whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe giggled. &#34;I have a small favor to ask if it&#39;s not too much trouble.&#34;</p>
