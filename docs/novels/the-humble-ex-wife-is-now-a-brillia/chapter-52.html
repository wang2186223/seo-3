                <p>Sprawled on the floor, Finnegan&#39;s mind spun in a haze of confusion. Only moments ago, he&#39;d been feigning unconsciousness in peace, but the second the word &#34;vet&#34; hit his ears, a surge of panic jolted through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cracked open one wary eye, risking a sly peek at his surroundings-and what he saw nearly made his heart stop. Christina was wielding a syringe so enormous that it looked fit for tranquilizing an elephant. No human being could possibly survive a dose from that thing. Hell, even a wild boar wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan had no hesitation believing the needle could drop him dead in a heartbeat. Did Christina intend to bring him down alongside her? His life was valuable. Dying alongside this pathetic bitch would be a colossal waste. She didn&#39;t even deserve the honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan squeezed his wife&#39;s hand in secret,desperation written in the tension of his grip-a silent cue for Sheila to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila shot upright, her voice trembling with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>outrage. &#34;Absolutely not! You&#39;re not using that thing on my husband. Are you out of your mind?You&#39;ll kill him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t bother to argue. She simply reached out a palm, calm and expectant. &#34;AII right, have it your way. You lost the bet, so pay up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cool determination made it clear-she wasn&#39;t leaving without that five million. What kind of twisted family threw down million-dollar gambles like pocket change? They were so eager to throw money at her, and she&#39;d be a fool to say no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, her face flushed with indignation, snapped,&#34;Pay you? For what? You haven&#39;t even cured Finnegan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina cocked an eyebrow, a scornful smirk tugging at her lips. &#34;If you won&#39;t let me treat him,how exactly am I supposed to cure him? Let me try, and I promise he&#39;ll walk out of here healthy. If I fail,you win.Simple as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda started to plead. &#34;Christina,please-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina sliced through her words with a cold, flat command. &#34;Enough. Either let me do this or hand over the money. I&#39;m done listening to excuses&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We won&#39;t pay you. What can you... Ah...&#34; Katie tried to push back, but her protest ended in a shriek of pure terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina lunged, wielding the monstrous syringe like a weapon, her gaze wild and unflinching,radiating a threat that made everyone&#39;s blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan snapped awake at the sound, his eyes going wide as he caught sight of Christina storming toward him, that syringe aimed straight at his heart. Whatever hope he&#39;d had of survival instantly evaporated-this woman wasn&#39;t trying to save him. She was about to murder him in broad daylight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a life-saving injection!&#34; Christina declared, slamming the syringe downward with zero hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hell no!&#34; Finnegan barked, panic overtaking his pride.&#34;You fucking lunatic-stay away from me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled backward, pale and sweating,rolling out of the way as Christina&#39;s &#34;treatment&#34;came down with deadly force. He was sure this woman was insane. Absolutely, irredeemably insane-there was no other word for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s wild laughter rang out as she missed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her mark, flinging her arm back for another go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You deranged bitch! Are you out of your fucking head?&#34; Finnegan shrieked, scrambling up from the floor. He stumbled forward in a panic.&#34;Somebody stop her! She&#39;s gone berserk! Stop her! She&#39;s about to kill me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the syringe, Christina flashed a deranged grin. Her eyes glittered with a manic light, giving off the unmistakable aura of an escaped lunatic. The syringe hovered menacingly in her fist as she stalked forward, her every movement promising chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finnegan!&#34; Sheila gasped, lunging to intercept Christina to protect Finnegan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the instant Christina&#39;s wild, feral gaze swung in her direction, Sheila&#39;s courage shattered. She shrieked, &#34;No! Stay away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila stumbled back, tripping over her own feet,eyes wide with pure panic. She wasn&#39;t alone-everyone else retreated in frantic disarray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one doubted it now: Christina had snapped,gone completely off the rails. There was something chilling about confronting a lunatic-someone who had nothing left to lose and could shatter the rules with a flick of her wrist.That kind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of unpredictable recklessness was terrifying, the threat of sudden violence hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the others shrank back, Christina whipped around and locked eyes with Finnegan, her grin stretching wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Finnegan dared to hope she&#39;d forgotten him, her predatory gaze pinned him in place, icy terror flooding his veins-he was certain this was the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time for your shot...&#34; Christina grinned,charging forward with the syringe poised like a weapon.She looked like a fanatic soldier, gripping her last grenade-utterly fearless, fully prepared to go down with her target, the menace in her eyes enough to freeze the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...&#34; A strangled cry slipped from Finnegan&#39;s lips,panic overwhelming him.</p>
