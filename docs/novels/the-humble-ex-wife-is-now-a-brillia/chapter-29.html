                <p>On the surface, Christina resembled a frightened rabbit-wide eyes, trembling frame-yet a sly smirk hinted at the steel beneath her facade.Long before now, she&#39;d worked the ropes loose.These fools never stood a chance of holding her down. Fear was the last thing on her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glimmer of something fierce flashed in those tear-stained eyes as her would-be attackers lunged. Deep in her chest, a cold, silent laugh built. Just as she prepared to strike-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang! The crack of gunfire ripped through the warehouse. The closest thug dropped lifelessly,his body crumpling mid-step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, stunned silence gripped the room.Every eye locked on the fresh corpse at Christina&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Death&#39;s reek was unmistakable, thickening the stagnant air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Shot after shot rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s goons hit the floor one by one-like toy soldiers knocked over by an unseen hand. The goons posted outside had already been dealt with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Jacob remained, the sole survivor in a sea of bodies. He shook violently, terror overtaking rage.That was when Dylan strode inside-cold and implacable, a shadow in human form, death glinting in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The muzzle of Dylan&#39;s pistol tracked Jacob&#39;s every move, promising no mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s nerves failed him. He lost all feeling in his legs. Survival instincts flared. He scrambled desperately, desperate to flee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dylan&#39;s men dragged Jacob back, tossing him to the floor like discarded garbage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crashing to his knees, Jacob dissolved into hysterical sobs. &#34;M-Mr. Scott! Please! I beg you-have mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill of a gun barrel pressed into Jacob&#39;s scalp, and sheer terror overwhelmed him-he lost control, urine soaking his pants as he shook uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-| didn&#39;t-Ah-!&#34; A savage kick from Dylan landed on Jacob&#39;s side, shattering ribs before Jacob could finish his plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who gave you permission to touch the woman under my protection?&#34; Dylan&#39;s voice was pure ice,lethal and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gun never wavered, trained on Jacob&#39;s head while the stench of fear filled the air. Utterly broken, Jacob could only gape, saliva dribbling from slack lips, his terror so complete that he lost the ability to form words. To him, Dylan wasn&#39;t human any longer-he was death incarnate,come to collect what was owed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From this moment on, the Terrell family is finished in this city. Find everyone involved in the kidnapping. Don&#39;t stop until each one begs for death,&#34; Dylan said, voice stripped of all feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; His men sprang into motion without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reduced to a blubbering wreck, Jacob choked out desperate pleas, his voice shredded by fear.&#34;Mr. Scott! Please-I&#39;m begging you! Spare me!Spare my family! I didn&#39;t know-honest! If I&#39;d known she was under your protection, I never</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would have dared! Please, I&#39;m sorry! Please!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saltwater streaked Jacob&#39;s cheeks as he prostrated himself, his body racked with terror.&#34;Please... Mr. Scott! Mercy-just this once!I swear, I&#39;ll never do anything like this again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no amount of pleading would save Jacob now.With Dylan&#39;s wrath unleashed, not only was Jacob finished, but the entire Terrell family faced obliteration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, derisive snort escaped Dylan, his eyes glinting with contempt as he stared down at the pathetic figure sprawled on the floo. &#34;You&#39;re not sorry. You&#39;re just terrified.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation took hold-Jacob crawled toward Dylan, but Dylan&#39;s men blocked his path without hesitation. &#34;No-no, please! I beg you, I&#39;m sorry!Mr.Scott,spare me...please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s wailing grew more frantic by the second,but not a hint of compassion flickered in Dylan&#39;s eyes. Those foolish enough to touch those under his protection had already sealed their fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out of here,&#34; Dylan instructed, his voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away!&#34; Without pause, his men grabbed Jacob, dragging him off like so much dead weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Scott! No-No! Please! I was wrong! I was-&#34;The shrieks rose, jagged and wild-screams of a man who already knew his doom was sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan&#39;s patience wore thin. He gave the slightest nod, and one of his men understood instantly.A quick chop to the neck ended the uproar. Jacob&#39;s body slumped over, mercifully silent.</p>
