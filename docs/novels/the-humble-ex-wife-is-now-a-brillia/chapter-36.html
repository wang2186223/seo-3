                <p>Both Dylan and Chloe fixed their attention on Christina, curiosity and concern minglingin their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If something&#39;s wrong, you can be honest with us.My brother won&#39;t let you down-he&#39;ll take care of anything,&#34; Chloe said, her voice full of support,assuming Christina was facing difficulties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan gave a quiet nod of agreement. &#34;Just let me know what you need. I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shook her head, offering Chloe a reassuring smile and giving her hand a gentle squeeze. &#34;Nothing&#39;s wrong. Actually, King just reached out to me, and I haven&#39;t had a chance to share the news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The siblings&#39; reactions were instant-a chorus of overlapping exclamations, excitement barely contained in their voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan was quite stunned. A swift response from King had been the last thing he&#39;d expected. It seemed King&#39;s reputation for being elusive was solid. Not a single trace of the message remained</p>
                
                
                
                <p>-King&#39;s reply had just reached Christina,unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did King say?&#34; Dylan asked, urgency tightening his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met, and Christina didn&#39;t hesitate.&#34;The patient you&#39;re desperate to save-it&#39;s your sister, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A somber nod from Dylan confirmed it, worry darkening his expression. &#34;Yes. Her illness... Time isn&#39;t on her side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At best, Chloe might have a year left-a truth that weighed heavy in Dylan&#39;s voice. He refused to let fate steal his sister without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention to Chloe, Christina asked,&#34;Do you ever get chills so deep that it feels like you&#39;re trapped in a freezer? And when that happens, do you also get splitting headaches?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;Spot on! How did you know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan was equally taken aback, but in an instant,he understood-this must be King&#39;s diagnosis.A glimmer of hope sparked within him. If King, the miracle worker, could identify Chloe&#39;s symptoms from afar, maybe the odds of a cure weren&#39;t just a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>fantasy after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s what King told me,&#34; Christina said smoothly, her gaze returning to Dylan. &#34;And as for our agreement,King accepts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan&#39;s chest tightened in disbelief. &#34;You mean...King really agrees to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady nod, Christina confirmed, &#34;Yes.King has promised to cure your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief and astonishment washed over the siblings,transforming their faces with sudden joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s voice shook with her overwhelming emotions. &#34;Is that true? Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already resigned herself to the idea that she had at most a year ahead of her, thus making the best of borrowed time and living each day as if it were her last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, no matter how much optimism or strength a person possessed, the reality of mortality could drag anyone into despair at times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Survival wasn&#39;t enough-Chloe craved life in all its fullness. She wanted to feel every heartbeat, to savor the ordinary moments and the extraordinary ones alike. So many faces came to mind-loved ones she couldn&#39;t bear to part with,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>people whose lives were woven tightly with hers.The fear of saying goodbye to them was paralyzing. Even clinging to existence by a thread seemed preferable to letting go. The prospect of death was far more terrifying than scraping by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle but serious note entered Christina&#39;s voice, breaking through the wave of relief in the room.&#34;But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan&#39;s grin faded, and hope drained from Chloe&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what is it?&#34; Dylan asked, his tone shaded with new anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina explained, &#34;King wants to get the cold spells under control before thinking about surgery -Chloe&#39;s condition has to be stabilized first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever King advised, Dylan was quick to agree.&#34;Anything King recommends, we&#39;ll do it. But can King really save Chloe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If King says there&#39;s a cure, then there is one,&#34;Christina answered with certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assertive tone struck Dylan as odd, though he couldn&#39;t say exactly why. Only later, when the truth about Christina&#39;s discreet identity as King came to light, did everything fall into place for</p>
                
                
                
                <p>him. That absolute confidence in her voice finally made sense. She had spoken not as a messenger,but as King, the miracle worker herself. Such conviction could only belong to King in the flesh.</p>
