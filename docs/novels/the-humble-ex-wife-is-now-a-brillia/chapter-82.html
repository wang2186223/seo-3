                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; Calvin blinked, momentarily thrown by the mother&#39;s sudden appearance. &#34;I thought you were still overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just got back,&#34; the mother replied, her anxiety spilling over as she hurried closer. &#34;Dr. Emmett,tell me-how&#39;s my son? Is he...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could voice her fears, the doors swung open and her son was wheeled out, pale but breathing. The relaxed expressions on the medical staff&#39;s faces made her breathe a quiet sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin&#39;s voice softened as he spoke. &#34;The operation went smoothly. He&#39;ll need to be monitored, but he&#39;s out of danger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flood of emotion washed over the mother&#39;s face. &#34;Thank you, Dr. Emmett,&#34; she murmured,her voice thick as tears threatened to spill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Calvin simply pointed at Christina, who stood quietly to the side. &#34;You should really thank her.She&#39;s the reason we made it in time,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother turned, finally taking in Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood with the understated poise of someone far too striking to blend into any crowd -fine-boned, impossibly graceful, with an air that seemed to shimmer even in the harsh hospital lights. Her beauty rivaled any starlet, yet there was something more-an aura both serene and magnetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you must be the one who brought in Dr.Emmett?&#34; the mother asked, stepping forward.Gratitude shone in her eyes as she gazed at Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am.&#34; Christina met her eyes with a gentle,self-assured smile and reached out first for a handshake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much. If you hadn&#39;t stepped in to save my child, I don&#39;t know what would have happened to him...&#34; The mother&#39;s voice shook,and she clung to Christina&#39;s hand, as if anchoring herself to her son&#39;s savior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really nothing. Dr. Emmett is the one you should thank most. I might&#39;ve tried, but without him, my good intentions alone couldn&#39;t have brought in the right help,&#34; Christina replied,her lips curving into a gentle, reassuring smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin cast Christina a glance, the corner of his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>mouth quirking with the trace of a smile. Her knack for faking it stayed flawless as always. If fate hadn&#39;t intervened, revealing Christina&#39;s hidden identity during the night she saved him,he never would have guessed that the legendary healer,King,was this quiet young woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Both of you deserve my deepest gratitude,&#34; the mother murmured sincerely, her gaze sweeping over Christina and Calvin. &#34;Once my son&#39;s condition stabilizes, I&#39;ll host a dinner tomorrow at Morfort Restaurant. Please-let me show my appreciation to you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Christina could protest, the mother continued with quiet determination, &#34;I insist. It&#39;s the least I can do to thank the people who saved my child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing her resolve, Christina relented and gave a small, warm nod. &#34;Alright. We&#39;ll look forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For now, you should go accompany your son,&#34;Calvin remarked, his voice gentle but firm. &#34;We have other matters to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother read the polite hint and offered a gracious smile, &#34;Sure, I&#39;ll let you get back to work,&#34; She glided away, her composure</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unshaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her heels clicked down the hallway, Calvin exhaled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shot him a confused look. &#34;Why the sigh? The surgery went smoothly, didn&#39;t it?What&#39;s with the gloomy expression?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly smile, Calvin asked, &#34;Do you have any idea who she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina just shrugged, the faintest smirk on her lips. &#34;Not a clue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a low, knowing laugh. &#34;Figures. Aside from medicine, nothing else ever seems to register with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of his mouth lifted in an affectionate,slightly exasperated smile. Her world probably looked like an endless stream of case files and surgical notes, leaving no space for anyone or anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t bother pretending to care about that mother&#39;s background, but since Calvin had brought it up, she tossed out a casual question.&#34;So,who is she then? Some big potato?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in,Calvin lowered his voice, his words tinged with significance. &#34;She&#39;s the eldest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>daughter of the Gomez family from Lorbridge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a heartbeat and then added,&#34;Actually, I&#39;ll be heading out soon to operate on another high-profile member of their family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a quiet, contemplative nod. lf Calvin&#39;s tone was any indication, the Gomez family was far from ordinary-more like the type whose every move sent ripples through the city. &#34;I see. It&#39;s getting late-you should get some rest.I&#39;ll head home as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin offered an easy smile. &#34;Alright then.Just don&#39;t forget about dinner tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t,&#34; Christina replied, her tone warm but resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they went their separate ways, Christina made her way out of the hospital. She had meant to meet Davina for dinner, but with everything that had happened, she&#39;d had no choice but to postpone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped through the hospital&#39;s sliding doors and into the cool evening air, a figure moved toward her from the curb. She recognized the man instantly-it was one of Dylan&#39;s drivers, a familiar face from past encounters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver offered a respectful nod. &#34;Miss Jones,Mr. Scott is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chapter 83 Unexpected Contact</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina blinked, surprised. &#34;Dylan is waiting for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; the driver replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity got the better of her. &#34;How long has he been waiting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roughly four hours,&#34; the driver replied, his tone honest and composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Four hours?&#34; Christina&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;We need to hurry!&#34; Shocked by the revelation, she wasted no time and followed the driver with quickening steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Dylan had messaged her, offering to pick her up. She&#39;d declined, busy with other matters, assuming he&#39;d simply move on. She never imagined he would wait-and for that long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they reached the sleek black Maybach,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the driver stepped forward and opened the rear door with practiced&#34; precision. &#34;Miss Jones,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; she said, her voice soft but earnest, as she stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan sat waiting, dressed in a sharp black suit tailored to perfection. His long fingers were loosely laced over his knees, his posture relaxed yet commanding. There was a magnetism to him-an almost disarming calm that cloaked a presence impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Done with work?&#34; Dylan&#39;s voice broke the silence as he turned toward Christina, his tone even, stripped of its usual sharpness. Tonight,his eyes held a calmer sheen-still unreadable,but no longer cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a quiet nod. &#34;Yes. You didn&#39;t have to wait. It&#39;s a hassle-| could&#39;ve found my own way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chloe wouldn&#39;t hear of it,&#34; Dylan replied,his expression smooth as glass. &#34;She insisted l</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bring you home and said she wouldn&#39;t sleep otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case... Thank you,&#34; Christina said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,&#34; he replied, as if brushing off a speck of dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at Christina&#39;s lips, but the exchange withered there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t exactly friends-barely more than acquaintances. The silence that followed felt stiff, like a wall neither knew how to climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shifted her gaze to the window,letting the passing lights of the city pull her attention away. To her relief, Dylan didn&#39;t question her about what had kept her at the hospital. She didn&#39;t have the energy to lie-or the desire to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car glided along the nighttime streets, its interior hushed like a sanctuary. The glow of passing neon signs painted fleeting patterns on the glass as Christina drifted into her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Dylan&#39;s voice pierced the quietness.&#34;Has King reached out to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina blinked, drawn back from her reverie.&#34;Hm?No...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to him, a flicker of confusion knitting her brow. But before she could finish her sentence-the driver yanked the steering wheel.The sudden jolt sent Dylan off balance-he instinctively reached out, one hand gripping the seat, the other sliding around Christina&#39;s waist just in timne to keep her from crashing forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the scramble, his lips grazed her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light, accidental contact stunned Christina.A cool sensation bloomed where his lips had brushed, freezing her in place as a wave of inexplicable energy surged through her. Her breath hitched. Her mind went blank. A shiver of awareness zipped down her spine, leaving her numb,dazed,breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was eerily silent save for the hum of the tires and the thunder of two racing hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, another lurch. This time, Christina fel completely into Dylan&#39;s arms. Her lips met the fabric of his shirt-soft cotton and the sharp,unmistakable scent of him. When she pulled back slightly, a vivid red imprint of her lipstick remained, stark against the pure white like a scarlet blossom in snow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning against him, Christina couldn&#39;t ignore the warmth of his body, the clean, intoxicating scent that wrapped around her, made richer with each inhale. She could feel his heart under her palm-strong, rhythmic, grounding. And it was speeding up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if pulled by an invisible force, Christina found herself drawing closer, her senses narrowing until all she could hear was the beat of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan looked down at her, his gaze sharpening as he watched her inch nearer. His heart-steady and composed just moments ago-now raced uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t make sense. He had never lost his composure over a woman&#39;s touch. Now, his pulse was thundering in his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ears, and he couldn&#39;t look away. What was this feeling?</p>
