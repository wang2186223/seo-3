                <p>Without missing a beat, Christina said, &#34;Deal!Just remember to transfer five million to me once | fetch Dr. Emmett here as per our previous bet. Don&#39;t even think about weaseling out. And by then, don&#39;t forget the public apology you owe me. Here&#39;s a little reminder-once you lose the bet, forgget about securing the chance of receiving treatment from King.&#34; She had every intention of making Katie and the others fulfill their end of the bet today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s lips curled in a smug smile. &#34;Works for me-as long as you can get Dr. Emmett here before the day&#39;s over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie doubted Christina could pull it off,especially not on such short notice. She was convinced Christina was a total idiot for taking on the bet even under the condition of a limited</p>
                
                
                
                <p>time. Booking a session with Calvin was already next to impossible. Even the city&#39;s elite had to wait for months, and Christina, barely valued by the Jones family, didn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you fail to bring Dr. Emmett,you know the deal. Hand over the chance of being treated by King,&#34; Brendon chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering calm, Christina just smiled.&#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her agreement, Brendon let out a silent breath of relief. For a while, he&#39;d been worried that Christina might&#39;ve already given King&#39;s treatment opportunity to someone else. But now, it seemed she was just holding on to the treatment opportunity, trying to use it as leverage to win him back. Sadly for her, her plan was doomed to fail in the first place since he&#39;d made up his mind-his love story was with Yolanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda glanced at Brendon, her tone gentle as she made another attempt to solidify her kind</p>
                
                
                
                <p>image in his heart. &#34;Brendon, maybe we should just drop this bet and not make things difficult for Christina? After all, Christina is your ex-wife.I-I don&#39;t really mind if I can&#39;t receive treatment from King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s gaze lingered on her pale cheeks and trembling lips, a pang of sorrow rising as he saw how willing she was to sacrifice for others. With emotion thick in his voice, he insisted, &#34;I won&#39;t drop this bet. Yolanda, I will do everything I can just to cure your illness. Losing you isn&#39;t something I could ever accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Yolanda tried to object, measured uncertainty flickering in her eyes, but Katie cut her off before she could finish. &#34;Yolanda, don&#39;t bother worrying about that snake Christina! You need to put yourself first. We&#39;re talking about the chance of receiving King&#39;s treatment-and the prospect of your illness gone forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Yolanda&#39;s eyes, her words barely steady. &#34;I just don&#39;t want to trouble you all.I don&#39;t want you to go through so much for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon answered softly, conviction ringing in every word, &#34;You&#39;re about to marry me.Whatever struggles you face, we&#39;ll face them together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Christina watched their exchange, a faint smile playing on her lips as though she were enjoying an overdramatic scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her amusement didn&#39;t go unnoticed. Katie suddenly rounded on her, irritation spilling over.&#34;Why are you still standing there? Go fetch Dr.Emmett already! Don&#39;t think you can stall your way out of this. If you can&#39;t bring him today, you will lose the bet!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising her eyebrows, Christina let out a light laugh. &#34;Even I&#39;m not in any hurry. Why are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed, flicking her hair over her shoulder. &#34;Why should I care? I&#39;m not the one about to eat crow,&#34; she retorted, rolling her eyes before turning away, clearly done with the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Christina slowly pulled out her phone and punched in a number with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instantly, the line connected, and Calvin&#39;s upbeat voice greeted her. &#34;Funny, I was just thinking of calling you about a complicated case, and now you beat me to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s lips curled into a small smile.&#34;|actually need a favor from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just say the word. You know I&#39;ll do whatever l can,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d appreciate it if you could swing by the hospital. I&#39;m here right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re already at the hospital? Is everything alright? | will come over immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, there&#39;s a patient I want you to examine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m actually at the hospital. Where are you exactly? I&#39;ll head over now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She passed along her location and ended the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>call, tucking her phone away with a look of calm satisfaction. Because she hadn&#39;t used speakerphone, everyone else remained clueless -no hint about who was on the other end of the line or what was said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed, her tone dripping with sarcasm.&#34;Honestly, you&#39;re such a nice actress. Do you expect us to believe Dr. Emmett drops everything for you, as if he&#39;s just waiting by the phone to answer your call? Get real. He&#39;s far too busy for games like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shared her skepticism. Calvin&#39;s reputation as a top surgeon meant he was practically untouchable. Even if he made the trip to Lorbridge and pulled every string he could,getting even five minutes with Calvin would be nearly impossible, let alone under these circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda tugged at Katie&#39;s sleeve, her tone soft,her words carefully chosen to make her appear considerate while subtly echoing Katie&#39;s accusation. &#34;Katie, please don&#39;t embarrass</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina like that. It&#39;s really not polite to put someone on the spot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie shot back without missing a beat, her eyes cold as she glared at Christina. &#34;What&#39;s wrong with that? Since she&#39;s bold enough to make wild claims, exposing her feels like the right thing to do. She asked for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out an exaggerated sigh, Yolanda turned her attention to Christina, her voice laced with false concern. &#34;Christina, there&#39;s no need to put on an act like this. Someone like Dr. Emmett doesn&#39;t come when summoned by just one call.Why set yourself up for embarrassment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone else could speak, a commanding voice rang out, loud and authoritative,cutting through the tension. &#34;Who accused Christina of putting on an act?&#34;</p>
