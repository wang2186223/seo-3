                <p>Christina rolled her eyes. &#34;If you&#39;re sick, go see a doctor,&#34; she snapped, her tone cutting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s fury crackled in the air, her hands practically itching to smack Christina across the face. But before she could so much as twitch,a hulking brute of a man stepped into her path,his massive frame swallowing up the space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie froze,breath hitching as her arm jerked back on instinct. The memory of those meaty hands wrapped around her neck-the brutal force that had left her dangling and helpless-flashed across her mind, squeezing the air from her lungs all over again. A raw, animal panic seized her, rooting her to the spot. No way was she risking getting snatched up like that a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s voice came out in a quivering stammer as she gazed at the man. &#34;Y-you... What on earth do you think you&#39;re doing? I-I&#39;m warning you,I could... I could call the cops...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man didn&#39;t so much as blink, his blank stare boring into her with all the warmth of a tombstone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold in his eyes made her skin crawl, like a ghost brushing icy fingers over her scalp. She couldn&#39;t even bring herself to look at him for more than a second-her gaze kept slipping away, chased by that creeping, suffocating dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after Christina and her entourage of muscle piled into the moving truck did the tension finally ease from Katie&#39;schest.She let out a shaky breath, relief flooding her as that paralyzing fear slowly uncoiled and faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in,&#34; Brendon called out, his voice clipped and unreadable as he opened his car door and slid inside, leaving Katie no choice but to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their two vehicles stayed glued to Christina&#39;s truck. Brendon refused to believe Christina had actually become some pampered mistress for a wealthy benefactor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie squinted out the window, her brows knitting together. &#34;Isn&#39;t this the road to the hillside mansions?&#34; she muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a syrupy,mock-worried tone, Yolanda leaned forward. &#34;They haven&#39;t left this neighborhood ... Could they really be headed for one of those exclusive estates? You don&#39;t think Christina&#39;s tangled up with some old, filthy-rich guy, do you? Perhaps...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda let her voice trail off, deliberately sowing seeds of suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed, crossing her arms, &#34;Is there any doubt? It&#39;s written all over her face. She&#39;s absolutely bagged herself a sugar daddy. Who in their right mind would choose a washed-up divorcée and treat her so generously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda shot Brendon a pointed look. The tension in his jaw and the way his knuckles blanched on the steering wheel made it clear he was barely holding it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda affected a thoughtful sigh. &#34;Well, she is divorced now. Honestly, whatever she does isn&#39;t anyone else&#39;s business. If a woman can&#39;t fend for herself, what choice does she have but to cling to a man with deep pockets? Stil...&#34;She let the thought hang tantalizingly in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s fingers dug even deeper into the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>leather, his breathing strained as he struggled for composure. He pressed, forcing a veneer of calm into his voice. &#34;Still what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s probably not my place to say. Just forget it,&#34; Yolanda murmured softly, glancing away as if she&#39;d lost the nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so hard about just saying it out loud? If Christina was gutsy enough to pull that stunt,she should at least have the backbone to admit it! If you won&#39;t say it, I will!&#34; Katie barreled in,unable to restrain herself. &#34;Brendon, what Yolanda won&#39;t spit out is that that bitch Christina was screwing you way before the divorce!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda appeared to play peacemaker, raising her hands as if to calm Katie down. &#34;Katie, we really don&#39;t have any evidence. Let&#39;s not jump to conclusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s there to be afraid of?&#34; Katie shot back,her voice trembling with outrage. &#34;No evidence?Then let&#39;s go find some!&#34; Her entire body trembled with fury at the thought of that slut Christina getting her hands on even a penny of their money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie whipped around to face Brendon, eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>blazing with contempt. &#34;Brendon, listen to me.We have to dig up proof Christina cheated during the marriage. Force her out with nothing -don&#39;t let her walk away with a dime!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just imagining Christina pocketing a villa and millions in alimony made Katie&#39;s blood pressure spike. That was Dawson money, damn it-she&#39;d die before letting some outsider waltz off with their family fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda put on her most delicate, worried expression. &#34;But they&#39;re already divorced. The settlement&#39;s signed. Trying to break it now would just rack up penalties. Besides, collecting hard evidence of cheating is nearly impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, as the soon-to-be Mrs. Dawson,Yolanda was just as eager to see Christina lose everything. She simply preferred to play the gentle, reasonable type, letting Katie wear the villain&#39;s mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s gaze flicked left and right, scheming.Suddenly, a cold,triumphant grin twisted across her lips. &#34;Actually, I&#39;ve got a way to make sure she forfeits everything.&#34;</p>
