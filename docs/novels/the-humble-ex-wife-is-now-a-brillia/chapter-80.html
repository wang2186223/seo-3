                <p>Calvin&#39;s breath faltered, overwhelmed, nearly slipping out &#34;King&#34; before Christina&#39;s voice gently interrupted. &#34;Good to see you, Dr. Emmett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Calvin realize how close he&#39;d come to slipping the name he was not supposed to say.He cleared his throat. &#34;Christina, what brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve come seeking your help to save someone.And there&#39;s another favor I must ask,&#34; Christina responded, her tone seemingly carrying urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who needs help? Is it you-&#34; Calvin paused,suddenly cautious. He swallowed his words. He knew better than to mention anything that might reveal Christina was actually King. She was always careful to stay out of sight, and if she had come in person, it meant the situation was dire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a young boy in this hospital in critical condition. Please, Dr. Emmett, follow me,&#34;Christina implored,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Of course. Lead the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, Dr. Emmett, what about the Lorbridge surgery?&#34; Johan interrupted. &#34;It&#39;s scheduled for today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin turned to him calmly. &#34;That can wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin knew what he was facing. Christina seeking him out meant time was running out.If he delayed, the young boy in question wouldn&#39;t survive. The operation at Lorbridge was important but not pressing enough to supersede this crisis.It could be rescheduled.Moreover,since Christina had entrusted him with this case herself,refusal was not an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Johan looked stunned but didn&#39;t argue. He just followed behind quietly, still trying to piece together what was happening. He scrutinized Christina, his mind racing. Who was this woman who could make Calvin change plans without a second thought? Calvin had always referred to Christina as just a former assistant. But this? This was different. No way an assistant made Calvin postpone surgery for a VIP patient. There was more to her.Way more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever the truth， Johan decided on one thing一he&#39;d treat Christina with respect from now on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group soon entered the elevator. The elevator doors opened with a soft ding as they reached their floor. Calvin started to gesture for Christina to go first, but she beat him to it.&#34;Please, Dr. Emmett,&#34; she said gently, giving a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though uneasy receiving such courtesy, Calvin accepted, stepping out first. He had long hoped to be recognized as her protégé, but she always refused, insisting it would be inappropriate given his stature. Still, their conversations often turned into debates about medicine. She challenged his thinking and broadened his views. While he had ceased pursuing the formal apprenticeship,the desire remained quietly alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they entered the emergency room, they were met with chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re losing him!&#34; a nurse cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Flatline! He&#39;s in cardiac arrest!&#34; another shouted,their voices laced with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Calvin and Johan arrived, the medical staff froze in astonishment. Christina had really brought Calvin here,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, Christina stepped forward to lend her expertise in the frantic efforts to revive the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone had already put aside Katie&#39;s claim that Christina was a vet. Even if Christina was a vet,the fact that she&#39;d come alongside Calvin-and was trusted to assist-meant she was more than capable. Saving a life transcended professional titles and disciplines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the operating room ready,&#34; Calvin commanded with calm authority. &#34;As soon as he&#39;s stable, transfer him at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away,&#34; Johan answered promptly,immediately overseeing the preparations himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through their combined skill and urgency, the boy&#39;s vital signs gradually steadied, allowing for his swift transport to surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next crucial procedure was a craniotomy. Yet,the boy&#39;s family had not yet arrived to provide the necessary consent. Ordinarily, the absence of signed permission would halt any operation to avoid legal complications. However, given the severity of the case, Calvin&#39;s direct involvement,and Christina&#39;s payment upfront, the team had no option but to proceed without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the boy was being wheeled into the operating room, his mother burst into the hospital,frantic and disheveled. She&#39;d been so panicked on the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>way that she&#39;d slipped into a puddle, soaking her clothes and ruining her makeup. Her hair was wild and messy. But none of that mattered now. Her son had been in a car accident-he was in emergency surgery-and she didn&#39;t know if he was alive or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After asking around frantically, she finally learned that her son was in the operating room. A nurse explained his condition to her. &#34;What did you say?A brain tumor?&#34; she gasped, clutching the nurse&#39;s arm in disbelief, her voice trembling. Self-reproach washed over her like a tidal wave. How had she missed something so serious? How could she have been so blind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, the procedure is intricate and high-risk.We urgently require your signature on the consent forms,&#34; the nurse said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother&#39;s fingers clenched tightly around the nurse&#39;s arm upon hearing this. &#34;What... What are the chances of survival? Is your finest surgeon the one performing it? Can you bring in the very best? No matter the expense, I will pay-money is no object!&#34; she pleaded, desperation thick in her voice,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse hesitated, choosing her words carefully. &#34;The procedure is extremely complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even our top expert hesitates to undertake it..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Then who&#39;s operating on my son?&#34; the mother demanded, voice trembling with fear and confusion. Her breaths came in uneven gasps,mirroring the turmoil swirling in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Dr. Emmett,&#34; the nurse replied. &#34;A woman came and requested him personally... He agreed to take the case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mother blinked, stunned. &#34;Dr. Emmett?&#34; she repeated,almost in disbelef. Slowly,tears welled in her eyes, her expression shifting from panic to relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank heavens it&#39;s Dr. Emmett... My son&#39;s lifeis in good hands,&#34; she whispered, her voice thick with gratitude. Then, she grasped the nurse&#39;s hand.&#34;Where is the consent form? Give it to me now-I&#39;ll sign immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A huge weight seemed to lift from her shoulders.Just knowing Calvin had taken the case gave her hope.She was eager to complete the paperwork quickly, fearing he might reconsider. Once the form was signed, she asked for the location of the operating theater,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as the nurse turned to leave, she suddenly called out, &#34;Wait...&#34;</p>
