                <p>Chloe&#39;s words</p>
                
                
                
                <p>made Dylan still, mid-motion, as Christina&#39;s face flickered unbidden across his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina truly was extraordinary. Only a blind fool like her ex-husband could&#39;ve failed to see her worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan?&#34; Chloe&#39;s voice pulled at the edge of his awareness, but he didn&#39;t respond right away.&#34;Dylan!&#34; she called out louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan snapped out of his thoughts and turned to her.&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The soup&#39;s about to burn!&#34; Chloe&#39;s eyes widened as she pointed toward the stove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the soup was about done, Dylan quickly switched off the burner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave him a teasing grin. &#34;So, what kind of girl do you like? If Christina&#39;s not your type,I can set you up with one of my classmates.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan&#39;s expression darkened instantly. &#34;Stop playing matchmaker for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe pouted, still playful. &#34;I&#39;m just trying to make sure you don&#39;t grow old and grumpy alone.&#34; Her tone shifted, softening. &#34;With my health being what it is... Well, who knows how long I&#39;ve got...&#34;Her gaze dropped, lashes fanning over her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, a quiet shadow crossed her face.But just as quickly, she rallied, looking up with a bright, almost doll-like smile-big eyes, long lashes, and a sparkle that belied the heaviness she&#39;d just let slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan!&#34; Chloe gave his shoulder a playful smack,her voice laced with forced cheer. &#34;The continuation of our family line is in your hands now,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She masked it well, but deep down, she knew her time was slipping away. The doctors had said she might have at most a year ahead of her, but she could just as easily be gone tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the thing about life: it never asked for permission before changing everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe had made peace with the unknown.Every sunrise was a gift. Every breath, a blessing. She chose joy where she could, laughter when it came. But no amount of optimism could fully</p>
                
                
                
                <p>silence the quiet dread in her heart. Some nights,the thought of saying goodbye to the people who loved her-it hollowed her out. Their kindness,their unwavering support... It crushed her with love and sorrow in equal measure. She loved them too. Fiercely. The idea of leaving them was the one thing she wasn&#39;t ready to face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan looked at her-the radiant smile she always wore, those signature crescent eyes-but he noticed how red-rimmed her eyes were. &#34;Chloe,&#34;he said softly. &#34;Don&#39;t think like that. You&#39;re going to be fine, I swear. Didn&#39;t I tell you? I got you that treatment slot with King.&#34; He tried to keep his voice light,reassuring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She murmured, blinking away the tears, &#34;I know,and I know it was Christina who made it happen.But whether King agrees to treat me and the odds of healing me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She trailed off, a brittle smile forming. &#34;I&#39;m not afraid of dying, Dylan. Not really. I&#39;m just afraid of leaving you all behind. I love you too much. That&#39;s the part I can&#39;t handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered, her lips smiling even as her eyes betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not going anywhere,&#34; Dylan said firmly,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stepping closer. His voice had taken on steel now.&#34;If I have to fight Death himself, I will. Just like you did for me all those years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he meant it. If not for Chloe, he wouldn&#39;t even be here. She had once pulled him out of death&#39;s grip. She had saved him when no one else could. Now it was his turn to return the favor,even if it killed him. Some debts couldn&#39;t be paid with words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan reached out, his thumb gently brushing away a tear clinging to the corner of Chloe&#39;s eye.&#34;Stop crying,&#34; he said with mock severity.&#34;You look ugly when you cry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not ugly!&#34; Chloe shot back with a laugh, her sorrow cracking apart like ice under sunlight.&#34;But... Am I being too greedy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course not,&#34; Dylan murmured. &#34;Wanting more time with the people you love isn&#39;t greed. It&#39;s human.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s eyes shimmered, but this time, it was with warmth.&#34;Having you all... That&#39;s the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to me.&#34; She then paused before adding with a cheeky grin, &#34;Though it&#39;d be even better if I had a sister-in-law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit fooling around and grab the bowls,&#34; Dylan</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replied, his tone softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Have it your way then!&#34; Her laughter rang out like music, light and unrestrained, filling the kitchen with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to believe a laugh that vibrant came from someone living on borrowed time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still chuckling, Chloe grabbed the bowls and stepped out of the kitchen-only to halt abruptly.Standing at the corner was Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe blinked, caught off guard. She had no idea how long Christina had been there or how much she&#39;d heard. &#34;Christina!&#34; she called out,her voice lifting slightly in surprise.</p>
