                <p>Samuel regarded Christina with a gleam of admiration in his eyes, the corners of his mouth lifting into a rare, gentle smile. In that moment, he couldn&#39;t help but think-the Scott bloodline outshined the Grahams by miles. Such clarity.Such instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast between Ralphy and Dylan made Samuel&#39;s blood boil. The comparison wasn&#39;t even close. With a grunt of frustration, he shoved the phone back into Ralphy&#39;s hand. Ralphy&#39;s career was already inferior to Dylan&#39;s, and now, Dylan showcased better tasté in choosing partners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You useless rascal!&#34; Samuel thundered at Ralphy, pacing with agitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, please!&#34; Ralphy said quickly, trying to pacify him. &#34;Let&#39;s not lose sight of the goal-the secret trick. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Samuel wasn&#39;t listening. His expression hardened as he turned on his heel and strode away,seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, from the phone&#39;s speaker, Morse&#39;s laughter echoed mockingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you laugh at a time like this!&#34; Ralphy snapped, his eyes flashing with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your grandfather&#39;s something else,&#34; Morse said,amusement lacing every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy frowned. He still didn&#39;t get it that Christina wasn&#39;t just a name in passing-she was the axis on which everything turned. But to him, the conversation between his grandpa and Morse was a cipher, each word more perplexing than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ending the call,&#34; Morse said, smirking faintly.&#34;| have to take Miss Jones home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy blurted out, &#34;Wait-what about the secret trick? At least give me a hint!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Jones needs to be taken home,&#34; Morse said coolly.&#34;We&#39;ll talk later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, the screen went dark. Ralphy stared at the phone for a beat, stunned. Then,slowly, realization dawned-and hit him like a lightning bolt. Christina wasn&#39;t just important-she was the key. His expression shifted from</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bafflement to glee. From this moment forward, he vowed to treat Christina like royalty-ride her coattails, sing her praises, and sponge off Dylan&#39;s hospitality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a self-satisfied smirk, Ralphy whispered to himself, &#34;Miss Jones, looks like I&#39;ll be relying on you from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Christina shuffled out of bed,bleary-eyed and sluggish. Still half-asleep, she fumbled through her morning routine, brushing her teeth with her eyes closed, swaying slightly like a drunk sailor adrift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hangover hadn&#39;t worn off yet. Davina had shown up last night with a bottle of something strong, and the two of them had gone a few rounds deeper than planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, Christina felt like her head was wrapped in cotton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, there was a ruckus outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her senses sharpened in an instant. Could it be Davina coming over again? Clutching her toothbrush, still clad in her cozy bear-print pajamas, she padded toward the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! This one&#39;s just perfect! A full sea-view estate! Absolutely ideal for this season-so cozy and tranquil!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina froze mid-step. That voice. Definitely not Davina. Her brow furrowed sharply. She knew that chirpy, fake-sweet tone anywhere. Joselyn.What the hell was Joselyn doing here? And Joselyn wasn&#39;t alone. Judging by the background chatter, she had company. Was Joselyn talking about renting this place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes narrowed. This estate was a part of the divorce settlement with Brendon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, any place will do, as long as Brendon and Yolanda are happy,&#34; said Sheila Mitchell,Yolanda&#39;s mother, her tone warm and polite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise you, once Yolanda marries into our family, we&#39;ll treat her just like our own daughter.No different at all,&#34; Joselyn remarked, puffing up proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With your assurance, we can finally breathe easy,&#34; said Finnegan Mitchell, Yolanda&#39;s father,his tone satisfied. &#34;Now that my father&#39;s on board, Yolanda and Brendon can finally be together. It&#39;s a happy ending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila hesitated, her brow creasing slightly. &#34;But...Are Brendon and that woman truly over? There&#39;s been no public word about their divorce. I&#39;m still uneasy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Mitchell, there&#39;s no need to worry,&#34; Katie interjected smoothly. &#34;The divorce papers are signed and sealed. I&#39;ve seen them with my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila exhaled, visibly relieved. &#34;Thank goodness.I&#39;ve heard rumors about that woman&#39;s private affairs... Not exactly the sort of thing one wants linked to the family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan&#39;s face darkened. &#34;A woman like that-fickle and disloyal-will never be allowed near the Mitchell name. She&#39;s súch a stain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed, her nose wrinkling with disgust.&#34;It&#39;s all my grandmother&#39;s fault. She went soft and let Christina into our family. Christina brought us nothing but embarrassment! Thank God, Brendon came to his senses and divorced her. She&#39;s revolting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie, maybe Christina had her reasons,&#34;Yolanda said gently, feigning sympathy while expertly twisting the blade. &#34;We don&#39;t know the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>whole story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn patted Yolanda&#39;s hand. &#34;You&#39;re too kind for your own good, dear. A woman like Christina doesn&#39;t deserve your compassion. Kindness like yours can be a liability if someone like her decides to take advantage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Joselyn&#39;s eyes, Yolanda was the perfect match for her son-elegant, well-bred, poised.Everything Christina was not. Brendon deserved someone like Yolanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the reason I don&#39;t have a grandchild yet,&#34;Joselyn added bitterly. &#34;She latched onto Brendon like a leech for years and still couldn&#39;t bear him a child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you&#39;re having a good time spewing shit out of that vile mouth of yours!&#34; Christina&#39;s voice cut through the room like a blade. All heads turned in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, Christina looked Joselyn dead in the eye.&#34;No matter how capable a woman is, there&#39;s only so much she can do if the real problem lies with her husband in terms of having babies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk danced on Christina&#39;s lips as her eyes flicked-mockingly-from Joselyn to Katie.</p>
