                <p>&#34;What on earth are you doing, Christina?&#34;Brendon&#39;s voice was sharp, thick with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stayed calm, her expression unreadable. &#34;I just told the truth. Bethel deserved to know.What&#39;s wrong with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Brendon started, but Bethel&#39;s voice cut through his like a knife. &#34;That&#39;s enough! Why are you raising your voice at her?&#34; she demanded, her eyes narrowing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her age, Bethel&#39;s gaze was sharp as ever. She looked at Brendon. &#34;Now tell me-what&#39;s really going on between you two? Why did you get divorced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon let out a heavy sigh. &#34;Grandma, you already know. There was never any real love between us. Marriages fall apart when there&#39;s nothing left to hold them together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina remained silent, though inside, she was laughing bitterly. If Yolanda hadn&#39;t come back,would Brendon have kept pretending instead of demanding a divorce? Of course, he would have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It worked to his interest that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel gave a harsh, humorless laugh. &#34;Don&#39;t try to play me for a fool. I may be old, but I&#39;m not stupid. Either you tell me the truth now, or I&#39;ll find it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon hesitated, jaw tight. He knew what would happen if Bethel found out on her own.And it wouldn&#39;t be pretty. Finally, he muttered,&#34;Yolanda&#39;s back...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel shot to her feet, slamming both hands on the table. Her eyes burned with fury. &#34;I told you before-l will never allow Yolanda to join this family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma!&#34; Brendon&#39;s defiance flared. &#34;Yolanda and I love each other! Why can&#39;t you just accept her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Love?&#34; Bethel scoffed. &#34;You think this is love?You&#39;re the only fool who can&#39;t see her for what she is! That woman disappeared the moment the doctors said you might never walk again years back! Did she even call? No! Not once!&#34;She pointed a trembling finger at Christina.&#34;And who stayed by your side? Who looked after you when you couldn&#39;t even stand on your own? Christina did. Day and night. She was the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>reason you recovered. Even the doctors said it was a miracle-and that miracle was her doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon rolled his eyes. &#34;Yolanda had no choice.And fine,maybe Christina helped a little, but my recovery was all about my own willpower and strength. Anyone else could&#39;ve taken care of me, and I still would&#39;ve walked again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s lips twitched slightly. She didn&#39;t say a word, but inside, she was seething. If it weren&#39;t for her-her medical knowledge, her sleepless nights, her silent sacrifices-Brendon would&#39;ve been trapped in that wheelchair forever. That miracle he took credit for? It was hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s eyes flared. Without warning, she lifted her cane and struck Brendon across the shoulder.&#34;You ungrateful fool!&#34; she spat. &#34;How did ourfamily raise someone as ungrateful as you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful?&#34; Brendon&#39;s voice rose. &#34;I gave Christina enough money to live comfortably for the rest of her life! All I want now is to marry the woman I love. Is that so wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s grip on her cane tightened, fury dancing in her eyes. She lifted it again to strike,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>but Brendon caught it midair this time. His jaw was set, eyes blazing. He growled, &#34;I&#39;m done backing down. I will marry Yolanda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s chest heaved as she trembled with rage.&#34;Fine! Marry her, then!&#34; she spat. &#34;But listen carefully-she will never be officially acknowledged by the Dawson family. Not while I&#39;m alive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stared at Bethel, torn between frustration and disbelief. Why did she defend Christina so fiercely yet reject Yolanda with such disdain? He had compromised once, bowing to his grandmother&#39;s wishes. But not this time.Not when his heart was on the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My decision&#39;s final,&#34; Brendon said, his voice cold but steady. &#34;I will marry Yolanda, the woman I love. No one else could ever take her place.&#34; His eyes flicked to Christina as he spoke,deliberate and pointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s expression darkened, her voice a low,venomous whisper. &#34;Then go ahead-marry that woman. But the day you bring that woman into this house is the day you lose everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart ached at the sight of her grandson throwing away a diamond for dirt. One day, he&#39;d understand what a fool he&#39;d been-but by then,it would be too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stood taller, rebellion surging through him. &#34;Grandma, give it up! I&#39;ll never go back to Christina. I&#39;ve made my choice-I will marry Yolanda,and no one&#39;s stopping me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Bethel gasped mid-sentence. A sudden tightness seized her chest. Her cane slipped from her hand as she staggered, clutching her heart.With a choked cry, she collapsed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bethel!&#34; Christina and Brendon shouted simultaneously, rushing to her side in panic.</p>
