                <p>&#34;Bethel!&#34; Christina reacted right away, reaching out to keep Bethel from falling. She checked Bethel&#39;s condition quickly and pressed the call button for help without any hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye,leaving the others in the room frozen in shock,unable to react. Before anyone could collect themselves, Christina had already eased the unconscious Bethel down onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie saw Christina examining Bethel&#39;s eyelids and rushed over, shoving Christina out of the way in a fit of anger. &#34;Move! What do you think you&#39;re doing? Stop acting like you know everything! You&#39;re not even a real doctor-you&#39;re just a vet at best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The push made Christina stumble for a moment,but she quickly regained her balance and retorted coldly, &#34;A veterinarian is still more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>useful than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More useful than me? How so? If it weren&#39;t for you,you jinx, would my grandma have fainted like this?&#34; Katie shouted, her anger flaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina often wondered about the way Katie&#39;s mind worked. How could she so confidently shift blame onto others and act as if she were innocent?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you all push Bethel to this point?&#34;Christina responded, her voice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the hospital room door swung open and a group of doctors and nurses rushed in,moving Bethel onto a stretcher and wheeling her out to the emergency room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone gathered outside the emergency room, nervously waiting for news about Bethel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon, I&#39;m so sorry. This is all on me. If l hadn&#39;t visited your grandma, she wouldn&#39;t have fainted like that...&#34; Yolanda leaned on Brendon,her eyes rimmed with red as she gazed up at</p>
                
                
                
                <p>him,seemingly apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t blame yourself. This isn&#39;t your fault,&#34;Brendon said, his tone soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Naturally, Yolanda is not to blame,&#34; Katie sneered,her eyes filled with scorn as she shot a glare in Christina&#39;s direction. &#34;It&#39;s that walking disaster&#39;s fault. She&#39;s the reason my grandma ended up like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keeping her composure, Christina replied,&#34;From now on, I want you all to stay away from Bethel. I&#39;ll look after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You only/ want to stay close to my grandma so you can trick her into handing over the Dawson family estate! You&#39;re just like those conniving caretakers who plot to snatch their employers&#39;assets!&#34; Katie snapped, her voice full of spite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh escaped from Christina. &#34;Think before you speak. Bethel might have fainted again if she had caught your absurd words.Don&#39;t piss her off again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When have we ever done anything to piss her off? You&#39;re the problem here! If you had just left Dorfield for good, none of this would have happened!&#34; Katie yelled, her anger boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absurdity of it all made Christina laugh again. She could never understand how Katie managed to spin the truth and always shift the blame onto others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, I know you care about Mrs.Dawson&#39;s well-being,&#34; Yolanda interjected gently, her words calculated to smear Christina&#39;s reputation. &#34;But you&#39;re not related by blood. Isn&#39;t it a bit much to forbid her grandchildren from visiting her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her-just another greedy outsider trying to grab the Dawson family&#39;s property!&#34;Katie exclaimed with a curl of her lip. &#34;Leaving her alone with my grandma is just giving her more time to fill my grandma&#39;s head with poison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shot Katie a look of pure contempt,as</p>
                
                
                
                <p>if she were staring at an idiot. &#34;You&#39;ll only continue to piss Bethel off with these absurd words. Just remember this-if something happens to her, it won&#39;t do you any good, but it might just work out in my favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie went stiff, her face twisted in bewilderment. &#34;W-What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s brows drew together as he stared at Christina.&#34;What exactly are you up to?&#34; Just being in the same room as her seemed to set him on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, you wouldn&#39;t really hurt Mrs. Dawson just to get your hands on the Dawson estate,would you?&#34; Yolanda asked in a shaky voice,clutching Brendon&#39;s arm and shrinking behind him as if she was frightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The estate hasn&#39;t even changed hands yet. I&#39;m not nearly as reckless as you are,&#34; Christina answered, a small smirk tugging at her lips as she looked at them with open disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, does that mean if it does get transferred,you&#39;d hurt her?&#34; Yolanda pushed further, dead set on tarnishing Christina&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said any such thing, nor do I have those kinds of intentions. Stop thinking that everyone is as calculating as you are,&#34; Christina replied in an even voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of color drained from Yolanda&#39;s face,and tears started to fall down her cheeks. &#34;I...I didn&#39;t mean for it to sound that way...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina! Haven&#39;t you stirred up enough chaos?&#34; Brendon shouted, his glare sharp with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chaos? I haven&#39;t done anything of the sort. As long as I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll make sure Bethel is safe,&#34;Christina said, her tone unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You? That&#39;s a laugh.&#34; Brendon scoffed.&#34;And what exactly can you do to mnake that promise?Where does all this confidence come from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Believe what you want, but I am more than</p>
                
                
                
                <p>capable of ensuring her well-being,&#34; Christina responded, steady and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s gaze turned sharp, and there was no mistaking the challenge in his voice. &#34;Alright then. If you can get Dr. Emmett to come today,we&#39;ll agree not to visit my grandma again until she&#39;s recovered. But if you can&#39;t, you&#39;ll have to stop setting your sights on the Dawson family estate or eyeing any of the Dawson family&#39;s assets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Christina could get a word in, Katie jumped in with excitement. &#34;Hold on! There&#39;s more...&#34; She aimed a smug smile at Christina. &#34;If Dr. Emmett doesn&#39;t show up today, then you&#39;re leaving Dorfield for good. Don&#39;t even think about coming back.&#34;</p>
