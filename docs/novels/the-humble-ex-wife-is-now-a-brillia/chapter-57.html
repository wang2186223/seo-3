                <p>The moment Brendon saw Yolanda&#39;s tear-streaked face, something in him caved. His anger melted away, replaced by concern. He reached for her hand and pulled her into his embrace. &#34;I&#39;m sorry... I shouldn&#39;t have raised my voice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda sniffled softly,her eyes lowered as she played the part of the heartbroken girlfriend.&#34;No, it&#39;s okay. We brought this on ourselves.You had every right to be upset... I&#39;ll send Christina the money right now-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need,&#34; Brendon interrupted. &#34;I&#39;ll handle it.I&#39;ll transfer the five million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of joy crossed Yolanda&#39;s face, but she quickly masked it with another sob. &#34;How can we let you pay up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Why not? We&#39;re about to get married. What&#39;s mine is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; Yolanda started, but he silenced her with a qentle finger against her lips. &#34;No more</p>
                
                
                
                <p>buts. Let me take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon, you&#39;re too kind to me. I don&#39;t even know how I&#39;ll ever repay you,&#34; she whispered,burying herself in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just marry me,&#34; he murmured, brushing her hair back. &#34;That&#39;s alLI want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t wait for our big day. It&#39;ll be magical,won&#39;t it?&#34; she cooed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be everything you&#39;ve dreamed of,&#34; he promised. &#34;You deserve nothing less.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda nodded eagerly. &#34;I know you&#39;ll make it perfect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s sharp voice broke their moment. &#34;If you lovebirds are done, can we wrap this up?I&#39;ve got things to do.&#34; She was disgusted by their nauseating display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon turned to Christina with a glare, his expression darkening. Was she really that eager to run off to another man? Living with him like some cheap rebound? &#34;Relax. You&#39;ll get every penny,&#34; he said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll believe it when I see the funds in my</p>
                
                
                
                <p>account,&#34; Christina replied, unimpressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s jaw tightened. &#34;I never realized how greedy and shallow you were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate the insight,&#34; she said with a dry smile. &#34;Now, how about the transfer of the five million?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Brendon tapped on his phone and completed the transfer. &#34;There. Five million.We&#39;re square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina checked her screen and then nodded.&#34;Confirmed. The bet&#39;s done. But don&#39;t forget-&#34;She met his eyes calmly. &#34;There&#39;s still the divorce settlement. The compensation and the villa. I expect the paperwork soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get it,&#34; Brendon said through clenched teeth. &#34;Every damn bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope so,&#34; Christina said, her voice light and unbothered, yet the warning beneath it rang clear as day. &#34;I&#39;d hate to bring lawyers or journalists into this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s eyes darkened as he was pissed off by her. But then, a new theory bloomed in his mind-twisted yet strangely comforting. Maybe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>this wasn&#39;t indifference. Maybe Christina was just putting on an elaborate show, desperate for his attention. Maybe she still loved him.That would explain everything-her defiance,her theatrics, even her sudden independence.The idea stroked his pride. Of course. She couldn&#39;t possibly have moved on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did that man really dispatch people to help you move?&#34; Brendon asked, voice tinged with disbelief. &#34;You didn&#39;t have to stage this whole act to test me, Christina. My heart belongs to Yolanda-it always will. You need to stop. This childish game isn&#39;t going to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ding-dong. The doorbell interrupted his speech mid-sentence, killing the smug expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing him a glance, Christina walked over and tapped the video feed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, we&#39;re from the moving company-&#34; The camera revealed a group of tall, broad-shouldered men standing in uniform at the door.They looked like they could lift a truck with one hand and crush a skull with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly. Her instincts kicked in. Years of reading people made it easy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to see through their disguises. These guys were definitely not average movers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as suspicion stirred, her phone buzzed. It was Dylan. She picked up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moving team&#39;s outside,&#34; Dylan said calmly.&#34;If anyone gives you trouble, they&#39;ll take care of it. Whatever happens, I&#39;ve got your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina froze, stunned by the sincerity in his tone. He was protecting her. No questions. No blame. Just quiet, unwavering support. If it had been Brendon, he would&#39;ve accused her first-mocked her, scolded her, and blamed her.Warmth was never part of the equation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Are they bothering you again?&#34; Dylan&#39;s voice pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No.&#34; She snapped out of it. Then, in a deliberately sweet, exaggerated tone, she added, &#34;Darling, you&#39;re amazing-l love you!Mwah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan choked back a laugh on the other end.Her sudden sweetness clearly caught him off guard. Today just kept getting more entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, baby, go do your thing. I&#39;ll call once the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>move&#39;s done. Kisses, bye!&#34; Christina ended the call, still blushing from her over-the-top act.She had no clue how he&#39;d take the sudden sugarcoated theatrics, but she committed anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind her, Brendon looked like he might explode.Since when was Christina like this? She had never acted this way with him. Not once had she been this playful, this radiant.Yet,here she was, cooing like some lovesick schoolgirl for a sugar daddy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy coiled inside Brendon, white-hot and bitter. This wwasn&#39;t the Christina he&#39;d married and dismissed as dull and lifeless. No,this woman was magnetic. Confident. Irresistible. Every glance, every word seemed crafted to captivate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Christina opened the door to let the movers in, something in Brendon snapped. Rage overtook reason, and he lunged forward-</p>
