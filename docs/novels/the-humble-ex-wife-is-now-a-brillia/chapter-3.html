                <p>&#34;Brendon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,Brendon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie and Yolanda both called out, their voices overlapping as they rushed to stop Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brendon could move any farther, they stepped in front of him, forcing him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please tell me you&#39;re not about to run to that bitch,&#34; Katie said, disbelief tightening her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of anger crossed Brendon&#39;s face.&#34;Watch your mouth, Katie. That attitude isn&#39;t just rude-it&#39;s disgraceful. You&#39;re carrying our family name. Try not to drag it through the mud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda gently placed a hand on Katie&#39;s shoulder, her tone sweet and measured.&#34;Brendon, please don&#39;t be so harsh on Katie.She&#39;s still young and doesn&#39;t know better. If you still care about Christina, just be honest with me.I won&#39;t make things difficult for you. I&#39;ll go quietly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s eyes were red with tears as she made a move to turn away, her face full of hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her like this made Brendon&#39;s heart twist.&#34;Yolanda, no-don&#39;t go,&#34; he said quickly,stepping forward and grabbing her hand.&#34;You&#39;re misunderstanding. There&#39;s nothing left between Christina and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then be straight with me. Is there still a part of you that loves her? Because... If there is,I can handle it. I won&#39;t hold it against you.&#34; Yolanda&#39;s voice was small and trembling as she met his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon couldn&#39;t ignore the way her face twisted with hurt and hastily said, &#34;You&#39;re overthinking it. Whatever Christina does now has nothing to do with me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda reached for his hand, her voice gentle but firm as she said, &#34;Perhaps Christina has a reason to dress like that. Maybe she&#39;s struggling to fend for herself. We should help her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon was impressed by Yolanda&#39;s apparent kindness. &#34;You&#39;ve always had a golden heart,Yolanda. But don&#39;t fret over Christina. She&#39;s not struggling the way you think. I gave her enough</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to live comfortably, and if she chooses to be a gold-digger and discards her self-respect,that&#39;s on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda seemed like she wanted to say more,but suddenly lost her footing, her body leaning back as her balance faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon moved fast, catching her before she hit the floor. &#34;Yolanda!&#34; His voice cracked with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L... I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just too noisy here. I feel a bit dizzy. Let&#39;s go back to the private room.&#34;Yolanda&#39;s voice came out faintly as she leaned against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her steady, Brendon frowned. &#34;You should&#39;ve stayed in the hospital and rested a few more days. You shouldn&#39;t have insisted on leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning toward Katie, he instructed, &#34;Katie, take her back to the private room. I&#39;m going to the restroom and I&#39;ll be back in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion danced in Katie&#39;s eyes like a match to dry paper. &#34;You&#39;re not seriously planning to sneak off and meet Christina, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Brendon could respond, Yolanda gently placed her hand on Katie&#39;s armn. &#34;It&#39;s alright. If Brendon wants to speak to Christina,let him.She&#39;s not just some stranger-she was part of his life once. Pretending she doesn&#39;t exist won&#39;t make her disappear. And if her inappropriate attire tonight stirs up gossip, it won&#39;t just fall on Brendon-it could drag down the Dawson name too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re always so thoughtful, Yolanda, even considerate of that bit-&#34; Katie stopped herself just when she caught Brendon&#39;s cold stare. She froze,swallowing her next words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat later, Katie&#39;s tone shifted. &#34;Brendon,you see, Yolanda&#39;s still not in the clear. If something happens while you&#39;re out here wasting time,that&#39;s on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an exasperated sigh, Katie latched onto Yolanda&#39;s hand. &#34;Come on, Yolanda. We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, Christina exited the restroom.She gave her hair a casual toss, a small gesture that turned every head in the bar. Men watched her openly, eyes trailing her curves with a hunger that didn&#39;t even try to hide itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a short distance away,Brendon stood rigid.His jaw tightened as he watched the scene unfold, those men&#39;s stares igniting something bitter inside him. They weren&#39;t just looking-they were undressing her with their eyes.And he hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina Jones!&#34; Brendon called out, voice low but taut with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s head turned slowly, her gaze meeting his with a cool detachment. She gave him a slow,deliberate once-over before answering, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was casual. Distant. Like he was just another stranger in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That chill in her voice struck a nerve. It rattled something in Brendon he wasn&#39;t ready to name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, Brendon marched over and seized her wrist. &#34;You&#39;re coming with me.&#34;</p>
