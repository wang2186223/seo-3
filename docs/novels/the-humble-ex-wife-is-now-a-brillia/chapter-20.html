                <p>&#34;No one is more familiar with the truth than you are,&#34; Christina remarked, her tone cool and steady as she smirked at Katie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion creased Brendon&#39;s brow. &#34;What are you getting at? What kind of skeletons does Katie have in the cupboard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a conversation you should have with her.I couldn&#39;t care less about her affairs,&#34; Christina answered, sounding indifferent. Had Katie not provoked her, she never would have mentioned a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle protest slipped from Yolanda,her words deliberately chosen to ingratiate herself with the Dawson family while casting a negative light on Christina. &#34;Christina, please refrain from casting baseless accusations against Katie. If someone overheard our conversation, they might start gossiping about Katie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one making baseless accusations here. If you doubt my words, ask Katie about what she has done,&#34; Christina replied with a cold edqe, qlancing over at Brendon. &#34;Aren&#39;t we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>supposed to see your grandmother? Let&#39;s move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not until you explain what you mean.&#34;Brendon&#39;s jaw tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backing him up, Yolanda chimed in, &#34;Yeah.Christina, let&#39;sclear the air if there&#39;s any misunderstanding. This way, no one will get the wrong idea about Katie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie, they&#39;re so determined to hear the truth.Should I spell it out right here?&#34; Christina&#39;s question lingered in the air. She let a sly grin curl her lips, flicking a meaningful glance toward Katie&#39;s midsection-a gesture that said more than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others might have missed Christina&#39;s quick,pointed look, but Katie&#39;s panic made her notice instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy thumping filled Katie&#39;s chest, and she bit down hard on her lip. She viewed Christina&#39;s stare as a loaded threat. Despite her defiance,she dared not challenge Christina, not when the risk of Christina holding actual proof of her misdeeds loomed large. If her wrongdoings became public knowledge, her dream of marrying into an elite family would be crushed,and even those with lesser names would likely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>keep their distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to mask her panic, Katie blurted, &#34;What&#39;s there to clarify? I haven&#39;t done anything, so what&#39;s the point in talking?&#34; She swiftly changed the subject. &#34;Are we heading to the Dawson estate or not? Stop wasting time! Grandma&#39;s probably tired of waiting. If we&#39;re not going,then forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re going-Grandma&#39;s expecting us,&#34;Brendon replied without hesitation. Making Christina come to see his grandmother was a crucial step before he could talk her into handing King&#39;s treatment opportunity to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then let&#39;s get moving!&#34; Katie spun around,desperate to put distance between herself and Christina before the conversation returned to her misdeeds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda turned to Christina, her words measured as she piled up on her efforts to make Christina appear vicious. &#34;Christina, we may have hurt you before, but there&#39;s no need to invent things about Katie. She means well-she&#39;s just a little blunt sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t hesitate to fire back. &#34;Then keep your comments to yourself.&#34; She climbed into the car without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s first instinct was to scold Christina,but he bit back his frustration due to his need to strike a deal with her over King&#39;s treatment opportunity. He turned to Yolanda with gentle reassurance, giving her hand a soft pat. &#34;Don&#39;t let what she said get to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever the skilled actress, Yolanda made sure she looked aggrieved yet understanding, nodding as tears threatened to spill from her eyes. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride was silent, tension thick in the air.Christina gazed out the window, lips pressed together in silent resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda and Katie were dropped off at their respective homes first, and then the car headed to the Dawson&#39;s family estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel had never hidden her sharp tongue-Katie took the brunt of it, and Yolanda didn&#39;t fare much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the day, only Christina enjoyed unrestricted access to the Dawson family&#39;s estate. Bethel&#39;s approval was never required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When do you plan to tell Bethel about our</p>
                
                
                
                <p>divorce?&#34; Christina broke the silence. She wished Brendon would finally step up and handle the situation like a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it when the moment&#39;s right,&#34; Brendon replied, avoiding her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t see the point in waiting. &#34;Why drag it out? Let&#39;s just tell her today and be done with it.&#34; Her voice was flat, betraying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased Brendon&#39;s brow. &#34;You&#39;re really in a hurry to sever all ties,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have no ties left to sever,&#34; Christina answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her response caught Brendon off guard, stirring an odd frustration in him. With a trace of spite,he responded, &#34;You won&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;ll make sure Grandma hears everything.Since the divorce is settled and Yolanda&#39;s back, I&#39;ll be with Yolanda now. Maybe you&#39;ll even get an invitation to our wedding.&#34;</p>
