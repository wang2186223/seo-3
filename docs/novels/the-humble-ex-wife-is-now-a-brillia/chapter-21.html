                <p>&#34;That won&#39;t be necessary-I wish you and Yolanda a lifetime of happiness,&#34; Christina said,her tone even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy ache settled in Brendon&#39;s chest,making it hard to breathe. He tried to say something,but the car rolled to a stop before the words could leave his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stepped out swiftly and left him behind,frustration and heaviness pressing down on him like a stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having been informed of their upcoming visit,Bethel had been waiting by the entrance,scanning the drive with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Christina appeared, Bethel&#39;s whole face lit up. A genuine smile broke through as she hurried forward to greet Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It feels like ages since you last stopped by,Christina,&#34; Bethel called out, her gray hair shining and her eyes lively with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Months of Christina&#39;s attentive care had done</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wonders for Bethel&#39;s well-being-she now brimmed with vitality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft smile touched Christina&#39;s lips. &#34;I&#39;ve just had a lot on my plate lately...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel squeezed Christina&#39;s hand, the mischief plain in her eyes. &#34;Did Brendon not exercise any restrait in intimacy, overwhelming you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This caught Christina off guard, leaving her a bit awkward. Her eyes darted away from Bethel&#39;s open warmth,unsure what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern flashed across Bethel&#39;s face as she caught the subtle shift. &#34;Something wrong? Has Brendon been giving you grief?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shook her head. &#34;No,nothing like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Christina could add anything further,Brendon quickly interrupted. &#34;Let&#39;s continue this conversation inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,yes,come in! The kitchen&#39;s outdone itself -there&#39;s a full spread of your favorite dishes waiting. I even asked for a nourishing soup,perfect for both of you!&#34; Bethel&#39;s face brightened as she agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to avoid the topic of divorce for now,Christina shifted the conversation, chatting with Bethel about lighter things as they walked. She knew springing the news of their divorce before dinner would only spoil Bethel&#39;s mood, so she chose to hold off until after the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel made sure Christina and Brendon sat side by side and then ladled steaming soup into each of their bowls with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had this made just for you two-drink it while it&#39;s warm,&#34; Bethel said, her voice warm and gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Christina murmured, dipping her head to taste the soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept across Bethel&#39;s lips as she watched Christina and Brendon, feeling hopeful that any tension between them seemed to have faded.She imagined she&#39;d soon be cuddling a great-grandchild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I want now is to see a great-grandchild in my arms, and then I&#39;ll be perfectly content,&#34;Bethel said with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can count on that, Grandma-your wish</p>
                
                
                
                <p>will come true.&#34; Brendon flashed her a reassuring grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a gentle smile, choosing silence instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the meal, the atmosphere stayed light enough, though an undercurrent of discomfort lingered whenever conversation drifted back to Christina&#39;s relationship with Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal,Bethel took Christina by the arm and led her into the living room to chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, their conversation stuck to safe topics,but it wasn&#39;t long before Bethel steered things back toward the subject of Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in and squeezing Christina&#39;s hand,Bethel spoke with quiet urgency. &#34;My dear, my strengthisn&#39;t what it used to be. I&#39;m not sure how much time I have left. All I want now is to see you and Brendon start a family soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of sorrow swept through Christina.&#34;Bethel,you&#39;re still healthy-don&#39;t talk like that.It&#39;s not good to focus on such worries. Besides...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pausing for a moment, Christina wrestled with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her words and then made up her mind to speak the truth. Honesty was best, she realized.Letting this drag on would only make everything worse.The last thing she wanted was for Bethel to hear the news of her divorce from someone else. That sort of surprise would only be cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina said gently, &#34;Actually, Brendon and I are already divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel stared at her in stunned silence, thinking it must be a joke-until Brendon suddenly barked, &#34;Christina!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden outburst snapped Bethel back to herself.&#34;Is this true? You two are really divorced?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to cover it, Brendon jumped in, saying,&#34;No! She&#39;s making things up-it&#39;s just a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Christina didn&#39;t waver. Refusing to look away from Bethel, she ignored Brendon&#39;s warning glare and said, &#34;This isn&#39;t a joke. The divorce is real-it&#39;s already official.&#34;</p>
