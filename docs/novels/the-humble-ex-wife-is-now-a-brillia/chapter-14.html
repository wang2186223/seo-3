                <p>Christina knew Dylan wouldn&#39;t have pulled back the curtain on his role of being the mysterious owner of the Morfort Restaurant unless he needed something from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do need a favor,&#34; Dylan said without hesitation, cutting straight to the point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, his eyes lingered on Christina,and the usual frost in his stare melted just enough to reveal something softer. People always pegged her as a simple housewife,someone forgettable. But even without the Rose identity or that trophy from the shooting competition, she had an undeniable presence.There was a kind of quiet poise in her, the kind one couldn&#39;t fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what exactly do you want from me?&#34;Christina asked,her tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering focus, Dylan replied,&#34;I need King&#39;s treatment opportunity to save someone.I don&#39;t care what it takes-I&#39;ll pay whatever it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>someone forgettable. But even without the Rose identity or that trophy from the shooting competition, she had an undeniable presence.There was a kind of quiet poise in her,the kind one couldn&#39;t fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what exactly do you want from me?&#34;Christina asked, her tone steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering focus, Dylan replied,&#34;I need King&#39;s treatment opportunity to save someone.I don&#39;t care what it takes-I&#39;ll pay whatever it costs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single brow lifted as Christina smirked.&#34;Anything at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Every cent, every favor. Name it,&#34; he said without missing a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped out of her. &#34;Even your life?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question hung in the air, teasing and sharp.Before Dylan could muster a response, Ralphy strolled in just in time to catch the tail end.With a chuckle, he interjected, &#34;You&#39;ve got guts, Miss Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his words carried amusement, his eyes told a different story. He scrutinized her,intrigued. This woman didn&#39;t flinch or stumble.Whatever softness she showed was surface-level. He&#39;d never seen anyone-let alone a woman-speak to Dylan that way./And to do it</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with that kind of ease? Unheard of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really,&#34; Christina said, flashing a composed smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina mumbled with foods in her mouth,&#34;Christina&#39;s the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy,catching only part of it, looked curious.&#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said, Christina&#39;s the best,&#34; Davina said between bites, not bothering to look up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy chuckled, genuinely entertained by Davina&#39;s confidence. &#34;You sure do hype your friend up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Davina finally lifted her head, her face alight with excitement. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t l? Christina&#39;s amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That look in her eyes said it all-pure, unshaken pride in her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget Dylan&#39;s got a pretty solid reputation too,&#34; Ralphy remarked/grinning as he leaned back slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy brushed off her enthusiasm, chalking it up to friendly loyalty. Christina&#39;s talents in various fields hadn&#39;t hit him/yet. Only later,after one reveal led to another like falling dominoes,would he realize just how wrong he&#39;d been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; Davina sneered, rolling her eyes before returning her attention to her plate. No matter what anyone said, in her world, Christina stood at the top. No contest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than feeling slighted, Ralphy found Davina&#39;s sass a little charming. She was refreshingly bold-nothing like the polished women he usually met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned her gaze to Dylan. &#34;So, have you decided?&#34; Her voice was casual, but her eyes didn&#39;t miss a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no hint of hesitation, Dylan nodded. &#34;lf that&#39;s the only way to secure King&#39;s treatment,I&#39;m willing to give my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no bluff in his tone. He meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stared at him, noticing the steel in his expression. It wwas the look of someone who&#39;d already accepted the cost. Who could possibly mean so much to Dylan that he&#39;d be willing to lay down his life without a second thought?Something about it tugged at her curiosity.Who exactly was worth all this effort from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not saying that to impress you,&#34; Dylan added, thinking she might not believe him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile. &#34;I know you&#39;re serious. But death isn&#39;t the currency I&#39;m after. I&#39;ve got other terms in mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interest sparked in Dylan&#39;s voice.&#34;What kind of terms?&#34;</p>
