                <p>Every memory of that night sent Jacob&#39;s rage surging. He ached to rip Christina apart with his own hands. Having her at his mercy now,trussed up and powerless, meant he could finally unleash every grudge he&#39;d nursed. He&#39;d wring out the answer he wanted, forcing her to surrender her slot for King&#39;s treatment, and then take his time making her pay in ways she&#39;d never forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when his appetite for vengeance was satisfied, only when he&#39;d bled every last scream from her, would he grant her the release of death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Jacob couldn&#39;t have imagined the truth: the object of his hatred, the so-called &#34;worthless whore&#34; he wanted gone, was King, whom the world&#39;s richest and most powerful would sell their souls to please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wheelchair wheels rattled over concrete as Jacob was pushed inside. His eyes quickly found Christina, slumped and apparently pitiful in the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shadowed corner, barely more than a battered stray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage had knotted Jacob&#39;s jaw, but seeing her reduced to such a state sent a cruel shiver of satisfaction down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where&#39;d all that swagger go, huh? At the bar,she had acted like she owned the place. Now she lay at his feet, a wreck gasping for air,nothing but a shadow of her former self. But this humiliation wasn&#39;t enough. He needed to savor her suffering up close, to carve the lesson into her bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re the sharpshooter everyone talks about?&#34; Jacob&#39;s voice dripped with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, ever the actress, trembled from head to toe, her reply ragged and frail. &#34;Y-yes... W-what do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really don&#39;t remember?&#34;Jacob&#39;s bloodshot glare bored into her. &#34;After what you did to me at that bar?&#34; His teeth ground together,fury on the verge of shattering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feigned look of bewilderment crossed Christina&#39;s face. &#34;Th-the bar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob practically came out of his seat, fists shaking. &#34;You bitch! All that arrogance, all that attitude-don&#39;t act like you&#39;ve forgotten what you did! You wrecked me and now you play dumb?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened as if a memory clicked into place. &#34;O-oh, it&#39;s you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laughter sliced through the air, bitter and sharp. &#34;So, it finally comes back to you. Here&#39;s the deal-only King can heal me. Give up your treatment slot, and I might let you leave in one piece. This is your only shot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flood of tears welled in Christina&#39;s eyes, her voice trembling, as if she was truly terrified.&#34;That slot means everything to me. I... I can&#39;t hand it over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A growl ripped from Jacob&#39;s throat. &#34;Like hell you can&#39;t! You owe me for what you did. You&#39;ll pay one way or another!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina held his gaze for a beat, appearing to cower before him, and then softly replied,&#34;It&#39;s too late. I already sold the slot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Jacob&#39;s face contorted with rage. The</p>
                
                
                
                <p>urge to leap out of his wheelchair nearly overpowered him, but the agony in his body sent him crumpling back, breath ragged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred radiated from his glare, his voice a venomous hiss. &#34;You had the nerve to sell it,you wretched slut? Who got it? Tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s answer came out barely above a whisper, saying, &#34;T-that&#39;s confidential... I can&#39;t say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob barely held himself back from lashing out-his whole body quaked with barely contained violence.After simmering in rage, he pulled on a mask of false gentleness,his tone dripping with deceit. &#34;You know, you could always call off that deal. Give the slot to me instead. I&#39;ll let you walk out of here-maybe even with a pile of cash. But if you turn me down...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words hung for a moment before he leaned in, his voice dropping to a menacing hiss. &#34;You won&#39;t live to see another sunrise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could mistake his meaning. Far from trembling, Christina found a kind of dark amusement in watching him spiral out of control. &#34;I&#39;m not backing out of the deal.I keep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>my promises,&#34; she answered, voice steady as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,Jacob&#39;s thin veneer of calm shattered.&#34;One last time-are you sure you want to do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s chin rose, exposing the delicate line of her neck-defiance blazing in her eyes. &#34;I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A twisted smile pulled at Jacob&#39;s lips, his fists balled tight with fury. &#34;Fine. Have it your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of mercy, he turned on his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get her clothes off. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; His goons leered and began to close in on Christina in the corner.</p>
