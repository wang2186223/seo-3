                <p>Most expected Dylan to move without hesitation, distancing himself the moment Christina stumbled. They knew Dylan despised any physical contact that appeared to be intentionally flirtatious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dim light near the entrance, the manager stiffened, panic creeping into his chest like a slow burn.Would Christina be another person to incur Dylan&#39;s wrath and get thrown out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, what followed left the entire room in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than stepping away, Dylan proactively reached out to support Christina, his response swift and precise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy and the manager widened their eyes,their faces registered with disbelief. Could this truly be the same Dylan they knew?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very man who had always shied away from even the lightest contact was now voluntarily helping Christina up. It was a sight so out of character that none of them had witnessed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>anything like it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s mind wandered to a different scene-Katie had flung herself at Dylan, only for him to swerve so fast that she practically crashed into the floor. The memory made the contrast blinding. Dylan&#39;s reaction toward Katie had been ruthless. But with Christina? He was gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s gaze toward Christina grew more intrigued. Was this woman truly special to Dylan,or was Dylan only helping her because of some deal they had struck?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, amused grin played on Ralphy&#39;s lips as he continued watching, savoring every second of the unfolding twist. Perhaps Dylan might start wooing Christina soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Dylan asked, his voice touched by an unusual softness in his otherwise guarded tone. Christina&#39;s unique scent drifted into his nostrils, faint but intriguing enough to make him linger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay,&#34; Christina said, finding her balance as she met his gaze with a calm smile. &#34;Thank you for catching me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though even without him, she would have kept</p>
                
                
                
                <p>herself from falling onto the floor, she still acknowledged his effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for thanks,&#34; Dylan replied casually. &#34;We&#39;re sort of business partners,after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; Christina said with a nod.&#34;Since we&#39;re partners, it&#39;s only natural we look out for one another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right.&#34; Dylan nodded.Strangely,when her claim leaned toward the business angle instead of personal concern, a wave of displeasure stirred within him, a peculiar feeling he couldn&#39;t quite name. No clear reason came to mind for the discomfort that crept in so suddenly. Still, he brushed the feeling aside, locking it away behind habit and control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To keep his position as the owner of the Morfort Restaurant under wraps, personally walking them out was not an option. Instead,Dylan gave the manager a quiet nod, signaling him to see them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three stepped into the elevator, and as they stepped out, Christina declined the manager&#39;s offer to escort them further, saying she didn&#39;t want to become the center of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WatchingChristina and her friend leave, the manager lingered for a beat before turning back to report back to Dylan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside Morfort Restaurant, Katie and her crew still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are we just standing around like lost puppies?&#34; Katie asked,clearly irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda said gently, her words measured to appear concerned while carrying implications,&#34;Let&#39;s wait for Christina a little longer. After all,she has once taken care of Brendon, and we shouldn&#39;t walk off, not when she had been summoned away by the owner of the restaurant and still hadn&#39;t returned yet. Brendon may have faith in her, but we still don&#39;t know enough about the owner of the Morfort Restaurant. What if he tries to force himself on her...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication tightened Brendon&#39;s jaw. For a second, a flicker of worry showed in his eyes before he looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For Christ&#39;s sake, she&#39;s an adult! Wouldn&#39;t she fight back if she didn&#39;t want it? If she gives in,then maybe she wants it. Why should we even care? For all we know, she&#39;s probably enjoying the intimate encounter,&#34; Katie sneered, her voice sharp with irritation, and a flicker of jealousy slipping through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone like Christina-a divorced woman with a messy past-manage to catch the eye of the owner of the Morfort Restaurant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie Dawson, Don&#39;t forget what I warned you about,&#34; Brendon hissed, his voice turning frigid as he locked eyes with her, his stare cutting cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katie could respond, Brendon spotted a familiar figure. Without another word, he left them behind and strode quickly toward Christina,his expression cold as he blocked her path.</p>
