                <p>Christina slowly shook her head, a chuckle escaping her lips. Soon, a quiet warmth began to spread through her chest, softening the unease that lingered within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then that she noticed the black silk nightgown she was in. She froze. When had she changed? Who had changed her? Her mind immediately went to Dylan. Could it have been him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertain and slightly embarrassed, Christina reached up and gently tugged at the neckline,holding it closer to her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could dwell on the thought any longer,a soft knock echoed at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood and crossed the room, opening the door without thinking. She was just about to ask who had helped her change-when the sight before her made the words vanish from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of Dylan, a young girl stood outside,beaming with cheerful energy. Her presence felt like a ray of sunshine breaking through stormy</p>
                
                
                
                <p>skies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina quickly sized her up. The girl was beautiful-striking, really-with a mixture of youthful innocence and a touch of boldness in her features. Something about her face felt familiar.She looked a little like Dylan. But her pallor gave her away. Though her smile was bright, her lips were pale, and there was a faint weariness around her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina could tell right away-the girl wasn&#39;t well. And whatever she was battling, it wasn&#39;t something minor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a spark in the girl&#39;s eyes, a curious and joyful smile that tugged at Christina&#39;s heart. It carried a quiet strength but also a hint of fragility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy to picture the girl as a bright, lively soul. Yet, illness had dimmed some of that light,stealing pieces of her energy. Still, she glowed with quiet resilience. She faced her struggles head-on, refusing to let her spirit break, and holding onto hope with courage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning!&#34; the girl said brightly. &#34;Are you hungry? Breakfast is ready. Come down when you feel up to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Dylan&#39;s little sister?&#34; Christina asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl grinned and nodded. &#34;Yep! I&#39;m Chloe.Dylan mentioned you fainted last night after being startled...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina managed a small smile. &#34;I guess I did.&#34;But she didn&#39;t explain. It wasn&#39;t exactly fear that had caused her to pass out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you feeling now?&#34; Chloe asked, her eyes wide and sincere. &#34;Better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much better, thank you,&#34; Christina said and then hesitated. Her fingers brushed the fabric of her gown. &#34;Um, this nightgown...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh!&#34; CChloe let out a small laugh. &#34;That was me.Well,my maid and I. We helped you change and cleaned you up a bit.&#34; She leaned in slightly,grinning mischievously. &#34;You didn&#39;t really think my brother would do that, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s cheeks turned a soft shade of pink,and she let out an awkward laugh. &#34;No, of course not. I should get freshened up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave her a playful wink. &#34;Good. We&#39;re waiting for you downstairs. Don&#39;t take forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t,&#34; Christina replied, smiling back. There was something undeniably charming about Dylan&#39;s little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe dashed down the stairs, her steps light with excitement, and made a beeline for the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the comforting aroma of pork rib soup filled the air. Dylan stood at the stove, focused,carefully stirring the simmering pot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan, is the onion soup ready yet?&#34; Chloe asked eagerly, inhaling the savory scent. &#34;Christina&#39;s awake. She&#39;ll be down in a minute after she freshens up.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach growled in response to the smell,and she licked her lips. &#34;It smells incredible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan didn&#39;t look up, but the faintest smile tugged at the corners of his lips. His voice was calm, but there was a softness in his tone reserved only for her. &#34;Go sit in the dining room. It&#39;s almost done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of obeying, Chloe leaned against the counter and tilted her head at him, mischief dancing in her eyes. &#34;Dylan, do you like Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand paused mid-stir. Just as quickly, his expression returned to its usual calm. &#34;Who&#39;s been putting that idea in your head?&#34; he asked,assuming it was Ralphy-his gossip-loving friend,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wno had been spreading rumors to Chloe.Whenever Ralphy and Chloe got together, it was like a nonstop gossip session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe grinned. &#34;Nobody said anything. I figured it out on my own. I&#39;ve got eyes, you know.&#34; She pointed to her big, sparkling eyes for emphasis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan sighed and reached over to lightly flick her forehead. &#34;No, I don&#39;t like her. And stop playing matchmaker. This isn&#39;t one of your dramas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t sure if Christina might be nearby,and the last thing he wanted was to make her uncomfortable. More importantly, he wasn&#39;t harboring any feelings. Or at least, that was what he kept telling himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave him a skeptical look, not buying it for a second. &#34;Really? You&#39;re not interested?&#34; she asked, her voice teasing. &#34;Because if you&#39;re not,someone else might be. Christina&#39;s absolutely gorgeous-you&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t act fast and someone else wins her over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love wasn&#39;t just about destiny-it was about timing. If a man waited too long, his chance could slip away forever. Tons of people had let their feelings go unspoken, losing the one they cared for simply because fear held them back.</p>
