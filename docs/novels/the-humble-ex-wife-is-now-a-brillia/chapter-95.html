                <p>&#34;Why should-&#34; Katie was mid-sentence when Brendon cut her off. She threw her hand up in frustration, shooting a withering look at Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll agree,&#34; Brendon said, his voice gentler now. &#34;Just take care of my grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; Christina replied, her tone frosty, her eyes distant. There was no warmth in her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shifted uncomfortably. The chill in her voice stung, but he still clung to the hope of mending things so that he could establish a connection with someone as powerful as Calvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Bethel regained consciousness, Brendon left her hospital room with Yolanda and Katie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they returned to Brendon&#39;s ward,Katie&#39;s fury erupted like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wny are we even listening to Christina?&#34; she snapped, seething with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon turned sharply,fixig Katie with a stern glare. &#34;Because she knows Dr. Emmett. You can&#39;t keep lashing out at her like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie folded her arms, defiant. &#34;Who knows how they even know each other? For all we know,there might be something shady going on between them.&#34; she spat out, dissatisfied, as she started to spread rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie, that&#39;s not fair,&#34; Yolanda said gently, her brows knitting together as she feigned disagreement. &#34;We don&#39;t know their relationship. No matter how close they are,we shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie turned toward her, frustration bubbling just beneath the surface. &#34;You&#39;re too soft,Yolanda. If you keep letting things slide,Christina&#39;s going to bleed the Dawson family dry.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L...&#34; Yolanda&#39;s gaze fell to the floor, her voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>barely above a whisper, her next words calculated to make her appear gentle and considerate. &#34;I just want Brendon. As for the Dawson family&#39;s assets, Brendon can give them to whoever he wants. Whatever decision Brendon makes, I&#39;ll support him, as long as he doesn&#39;t let you suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s eyes shimmered with emotion, touched by Yolanda&#39;s quiet devotion. &#34;Yolanda, you&#39;re too good.If Christina had even a shred of your kindness and consideration, we wouldn&#39;t be drowning in all this chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda gave her a mild, mock-scolding glance.&#34;Don&#39;t talk like that. Christina has her own merits too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Merits?&#34; Katie scoffed with an icy laugh. &#34;She&#39;s just a housewife who only knows how to scrub dishes. She&#39;s not even in your league.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda offered a soft smile. &#34;Christina&#39;s actually a great shot, isn&#39;t she? DidIn&#39;t she win a championship once? I think that&#39;s pretty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Impressive?&#34; Katie snorted. &#34;Please. She probably slept with the shooting range owner to rig the competition. No way she earned that title fair and square.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stiffened. Her words dragged his mind back to that very competition-the image of Christina, poised and fierce, a far cry from the quiet, unremarkable woman he thought he knew. The memory lingered, unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yolanda!&#34; Katie&#39;s tone sweetened as she hooked her arm through Yolanda&#39;s with affection. &#34;Didn&#39;t you always dream of becoming a fashion designer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda tilted her head. &#34;Yes, I did. Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just heard something exciting,&#34; Katie said,lowering her voice like she was sharing a secret.&#34;The Hubbard Group is about to launch a fashion design competition. First prize? You become their lead designer and the Hubbard family&#39;s exclusive stylist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda paused, taken aback, before regaining her composure with a smile. &#34;Where did you hear that? I haven&#39;t heard anything about the Hubbard Group hosting a fashion design competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My friend knows Mr. Hubbard&#39;s cousin-he let it slip,&#34; Katie whispered with a conspiratorial wink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It sounds like fun. If it&#39;s true, let&#39;s enter together. It&#39;s not about winning. Just participating would be amazing.&#34; Yolanda&#39;s eyes sparkled, though she masked the fire beneath her calm expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fun?&#34; Katie threw her head back with a laugh.&#34;No, no, no-you have to win. Once you&#39;re the Hubbard family&#39;s designer, you&#39;ll get me in the door. And once I&#39;m close to Mr. Hubbard...&#34; Her eyes gleamed as she clutched her hands to her chest like a girl dreaming of her fairy-tale prince.&#34;Boom!Mrs.Hubbard!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie twirled dramatically, already swept away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>by the fantasy. &#34;Once I&#39;m Mrs. Hubbard,the Dawson family will be untouchable. And when that happens, I swear I&#39;ll buy you a super-yacht.We&#39;ll throw yacht parties every day like queens!&#34;</p>
