                <p>It was just past four in the afternoon when Christina finally stepped out of the hospital room. Dylan had finished his work and arrived to stay with Chloe, giving Christina a chance to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had plans to meet Davina for dinner,and as she walked through the hospital&#39;s main lobby, her attention was suddenly drawn to the commotion ahead. A stretcher was being rushed in, and medical staff were moving with urgency. Blood stained the sheets, and a boy was lying unconscious on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please move aside-emergency case!&#34; a nurse called out as they pushed through the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor hurried over. &#34;What&#39;s the condition of the patient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Severe head trauma,&#34; the nurse replied breathlessly. &#34;But that&#39;s not the only issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scans showed a brain tumor. It&#39;s large. Our chief surgeon refused-said it&#39;s too high-risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have time to move him to Lorbridge.If Dr. Emmett doesn&#39;t operate soon, this child might not survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Dr. Emmett needs to catch a flight back right now, so he probably won&#39;t have time for the surgery. What about the patient&#39;s family?Have they been found?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing yet. Should we try checking the director&#39;s office? Maybe Dr. Emmett is still around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I doubt it. There&#39;s a high-profile patient in Lorbridge scheduled for surgery, and Dr.Emmett&#39;s flight back is for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the stretcher passed by, Christina overheard their hurried conversation. Her eyes fell on the boy lying unconscious, his head wrapped in bloody bandages, his pale face smeared with streaks of dried red. A wave of unease swept over her. If anyone could save him, it would be</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This hospital was the best in the region, a place where top-tier specialists gathered, and was equipped with the finest facilities. Yet, even here, no surgeons dared take the risk. If they didn&#39;t, no other surgeon in other hospitals in the city would either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina paused in her steps, her heart twisting as the boy&#39;s bloodied image burned into her mind. That was a young life, and walking away now would feel like ignoring someone who desperately needed help. She wasn&#39;t the overly compassionate type, but she couldn&#39;t ignore the boy&#39;s fate neither. Besides, she had to speak with Calvin anyway about Bethel&#39;s surgery. If he were still in the hospital,she could just bring up the boy&#39;s condition for him to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decision made up, Christina turned sharply and walked toward the medical staff, who were waiting for the elevator. She announced firmly,&#34;I&#39;ll cover all the child&#39;s medical expenses. Do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everything you can to save him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical staff exchanged glances. One of the doctors furrowed his brow, stepping forward with a heavy sigh. &#34;It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to save him,&#34; he said quietly, &#34;but right now, we&#39;re powerless. All we can do is keep him stable until his family arrives-so they can say their goodbyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice remained steady. &#34;Didn&#39;t you say Dr. Emmett is in the director&#39;s office? I&#39;ll go get Dr.Emmett myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We appreciate your kindness, but taking on the full financial burden with no guarantee that the family will be grateful isn&#39;t something just anyone can afford. If you drain your savings for this child and the child&#39;s family refuses to repay you,your money is as well as gone.Besides,Dr.Emmett is probably unreachabole right now.Chasing him might just waste your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Christina&#39;s good intentions, the doctor spoke from experience. After all, sometimes,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>kindness might be met with ingratitude. These medical staff members still remembered a doctor with a golden heart who once paid a patient&#39;s bills out of his own pocket up front for the patient, which the patient&#39;s family eventually refused to pay the money back and even almost stabbed the doctor. Working in the hospital,they had grown used to the darker side of humanity. No one could guarantee that every patient&#39;s family would be kind and thankful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the elevator doors slid open.Christina gave a small smile. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. You just focus on doing your best to save the patient. I&#39;ll handle everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saving someone against all odds-this was exactly how Christina always operated. She turned to leave, but then a familiar voice called from behind her, stopping her in her tracks.</p>
