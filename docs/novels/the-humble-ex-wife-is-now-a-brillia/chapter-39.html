                <p>Christina smoothed a gentle hand over Chloe&#39;s hair and offered a reassuring smile. &#34;I can&#39;t stay,sweetheart. There are a few things I still need to take care of, and it&#39;s just not convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s eyes sparkled with hope. &#34;Why don&#39;t you let Dylan drive you around every day?&#34; she responded, her voice soft and eager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe felt a natural warmth toward Christina even though they&#39;d only known each other briefly. She already saw Christina and Dylan as the perfect pair, quietly rooting for them to become something more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s laughter was light, her eyes crinkling kindly. &#34;Dylan&#39;s got his hands full these days. I&#39;d feel terrible taking up his time,&#34; she commented,squeezing Chloe&#39;s hand in gentle affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing how Chloe all but glued herself to Christina&#39;s side, Dylan finally stepped forward,shaking his head with a rueful smile as he gently pried Chloe off. &#34;Easy there. Don&#39;t hang on her like that-she had a rough night, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his reminder, Chloe&#39;s expression shifted instantly. She backed away, guilt etched across her features. &#34;Sorry, Christina,&#34; she mumbled,sounding just like a child who&#39;d been gently scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina waved it off with a smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing-just a tiny scratch, honestly,&#34; she remarked, her voice warm and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Chloe&#39;s disappointed look, Christina added, &#34;Tell you what. I&#39;ll come visit whenever l can,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina planned to check on Chloe&#39;s recovery during every visit after she brought over the medicine that would help speed up Chloe&#39;s healing. Once Chloe was stronger and her immune system bounced back, she&#39;d finally be ready for her surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe&#39;s whole face lit up, her eyes shining with delight. &#34;Really? You have to promise you won&#39;t lie to me,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t help but smile resignedly. &#34;I swear.I won&#39;t lie to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Chloe finally relaxed and personally walked Christina and Dylan to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the ride, Dylan contemplated for a bit and then broke the silence. &#34;Chloe can be a little blunt. Don&#39;t take her words too seriously-she just likes you a lot. Sometimes she gets ahead of herself because she cares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned that Christina might be angry, he offered a gentle apology in place of Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a soft laugh, her tone warm and easy. &#34;Don&#39;t sweat over it. I think she&#39;s sweet-and honestly, I was just joking with her so she wouldn&#39;t get down about being sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lighthearted tone caught Dylan off guard.For a moment, a subtle disappointment flickered in his chest. She really didn&#39;t seem bothered by Chloe&#39;s words of urging them together at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If King reaches out, I&#39;ll let you know right away,&#34;Christina offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan answered with a subtle nod, &#34;Thanks, I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged, radiating unshakeable calm. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s what we agreed on, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy flicker of irritation stirred beneath Dylan&#39;s composed exterior, though he struggled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to pinpoint its source. Was it her effortless detachment that unsettled him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over, the usual chill in his gaze giving way to a flash of something softer-something he couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right at that instant, Christina sat in silence, eyes fixed on the scenery slipping past her window-each tree and building blurring into a gentle watercolor of light and motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan, however, couuldn&#39;t look away from her.Sunlight drifted in, catching the fine strands of her hair and setting them aglow. For a moment,she looked ethereal, as if the daylight itself had chosen her as its muse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered on the shape of her profile, dazzled,until she turned suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their gazes collided, a quiet electricity pulsing in the air between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the glow of her clear, vibrant gaze, Dylan felt like he was staring into a mirror. Flustered, he cleared his throat, his composure slipped right back in, and his tone was guarded as he asked,&#34;Are we going to your place, or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina snapped out of her thoughts and smiled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to ease the awkwardness. &#34;Just drop me at the hospital. I need to see someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; Dylan&#39;s attention shifted to the road ahead,but his heart thudded unevenly in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina faced the window once more, outwardly composed, though her emotions were far from settled. A strange feeling was spreading through her chest. Was she actually developing feelings for Dylan? That was utterly ridiculous. She banished the thought as soon as it arose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finally reached the hospital, Christina quietly thanked him, unfastened her seatbelt, and slipped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to either of them, in a darkened corner of the lot, a figure lingered-quietly raising a phone to capture the parting moment, hidden from view.</p>
