                <p>Everything happened in a flash, catching everyone off guard. Most people just froze,staring straight at the scene. Christina didn&#39;t even see it-her back was turned. Everyone thought the bag would slamn into her. Instinctively, they held their breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then Christina raised her hand, calm as ever,and caught the flying bag like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was stunned.Eyes widened. For a split second, it felt like time had stopped.Unbelievable.What kind of reflex was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Did she really just catch that so easily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s insane! I blinked so many times-I still can&#39;t believe what I saw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must&#39;ve gotten lucky,right? Even if one saw it coming,reacting that fast is nearly impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could she be trained or something? But she looks so delicate. It doesn&#39;t add up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God, that was epic! I&#39;d marry someone that cool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, who had thrown the bag, stood frozen,completely shaken. This couldn&#39;t be real. Did Christina have eyes in the back of her head?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear crawled through Katie&#39;s body. Her limbs locked up, trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes turned cold. Without saying a word,she flung the bag back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit Katie right in the stomach. &#34;Ugh!&#34; she gasped, doubling over from the pain. She clutched her belly, struggling to breathe as her knees buckled. Her face turned red as she sank to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, the crowd erupted into cheers and clapping. It felt like they had just watched a villain go down. They were more thrilled than Christina herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie shook with rage, her body trembling like a volcano about to blow. These people were just as disgusting as Christina! All of them-pathetic nobodies with nothing better to do!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katie finally caught her breath and looked up, Christina was gone. Her eyes darted to the doorway, burning with fury as she clenched her teeth. She wouldn&#39;t let this go. She would make Christina pay!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers from the onlookers reached Katie&#39;s ears -though she couldn&#39;t hear the exact words, she knew they weren&#39;t saying anything good. She glared at them and snapped, &#34;What are you looking at? Want trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one replied. They backed away quickly. No one wanted to mess with someone from a rich family. In fights like these, the poor always lost.They couldn&#39;t fight back, but they knew how to stay out of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ding! The elevator doors slid open, and Christina stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had barely taken a step when two tall, broad-shouldered men blocked her way. They wore plain clothes,but she could tell-they weren&#39;t ordinary men. They were fighters. Most likely Calvin&#39;s bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina softened her expression, looking small and harmless-like someone easy to overlook.&#34;Hello, I&#39;m here to see Dr. Emmett. Could you please let him know I&#39;m here?&#34; Her voice was polite and respectful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the men didn&#39;t blink. Their faces were like stone. &#34;Please leave. Dr. Emmett isn&#39;t taking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>visitors,&#34; one of them said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their job was to protect him. No matter how harmless Christina looked, they weren&#39;t taking chances. She could be anyone-even a trained assassin in disguise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina saw through them. No matter how innocent she acted, they weren&#39;t letting her in.She didn&#39;t waste time. She raised her voice toward the office door. &#34;Dr. Emmett! Dr. Em-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards moved in, ready to drag her away. But she shouted even louder. &#34;Calvin Emmett!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice had barely faded when a thunderous roar echoed back. &#34;How dare you call Dr.Emmett by name?Nah</p>
