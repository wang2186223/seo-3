                <p>Christina flashed an easy smile and suggested casually, &#34;I haven&#39;t had anything to eat, either.How about we grab some breakfast together before heading to the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan came to an abrupt halt. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Christina&#39;s face faltered for a second. Before she even realized what was happening, Dylan was already turning around and heading into the house.What in the world?She had only meant it as a friendly gesture-was he really going to take her up on it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still a little stunned, Christina hurried after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Dylan walked ahead with a subtle smile playing on his lips, hidden from her view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the dining room, Christina found herself staring awkwardly at the bowl of oatmeal set in front of Dylan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about this. I told the kitchen last night that I wanted oatmeal for breakfast today..&#34;She paused and then added, &#34;If oatmeal isn&#39;t your thing, I can ask them to make something else Would you rather have some toast and milk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oatmeal is fine with me,&#34; Dylan replied, giving his head a shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are some vegetables and fried eggs here as well. Would you like any meat? I can get a plate for you,&#34; Christina suggested. A tiny worry nagged at her, thinking Dylan, as the head of the renowned Scott family, might not be used to such a simple meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan responded, &#34;No need. I prefer a light breakfast as it&#39;s good for health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I also think a light meal in the morning is best.Let me serve you some eggs and vegetables,&#34;Christina said as she placed a bit of each on his plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan picked up his bowl and started to eat.He couldn&#39;t tell if it was because he was truly hungry,but the oatmeal and side dishes seemed to taste better than anything he had eaten</p>
                
                
                
                <p>before</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Christina ate, she sneaked glances at Dylan, curious about his reaction.Watching him enjoy the food, she was a little taken aback.All along, she had assumed he&#39;d just been polite and wouldn&#39;t actually enjoy the meal. Clearly,she had been wrong</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chloe&#39;s getting discharged today, and I may not be able to go get her. Would you mind taking care of that for me?&#34; Dylan asked without warning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a nod. &#34;That falls under my job anyway. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure she&#39;s well taken care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; A slight crease formed between Dylan&#39;s brows, as though something was bothering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina noticed his sudden change and said,&#34;What&#39;s wrong? You look like something&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing serious,&#34; Dylan answered after a glance at her. &#34;I still haven&#39;t managed to secure the Woodfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll find it,&#34; Christina said with firm conviction, her tone carrying a hint of encouragement In truth, she was already thinking about trying another prescription for Chloe If there was stillno progress on securing the Woodfort within three days, she would have to switch to a new prescription. She was worried about Chloe&#39;s condition worsening if the treatment delayed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope so,&#34; Dylan replied softly That meal left him in a better mood than he expected-he felt light on his feet, re-energized, and prepared for whatever came next</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After seeing Dylan off, Christina returned home,slipped into something comfortable, and headed out by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, Christina pulled into the parking lot. She had just stepped out of her car and hadn&#39;t even closed the door when an annoying voice rang out nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina! Your car is just too cute-is it new?&#34;Yolanda&#39;s overly dramatic tone made her false excitement clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina saw no reason to answer. She pressed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her lips together and walked on with a frosty expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you walk away!&#34; Katie&#39;s angry voice snapped as she blocked Christina&#39;s path.&#34;Yolanda was talking to you. Didn&#39;t you hear?Are you deaf, or were you never taught any manners, rendering you this rude?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes turned hard as she stared back.&#34;Even if I were rude, I&#39;d still be better than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katie had the chance to fire back,Christina stepped around her and kept going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Katie stuck out her leg in frustration.A flash of spite shone in her eyes as she purposely tried to trip Christina, hoping to send her sprawling.</p>
