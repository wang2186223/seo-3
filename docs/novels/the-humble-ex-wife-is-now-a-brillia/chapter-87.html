                <p>Christina feigned a stumble the moment Katie tried to trip her, her body pitching forward as she acted like she was wavering before she steadied herself, deliberately stomping on Katie&#39;s leg several times in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agh, that really hurts!&#34; Katie gasped sharply,her face contorting as she swiftly withdrew her foot, the pain unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, that&#39;s too much!&#34; Yolanda rushed over,helping steady Katie with an expression of exaggerated concern. &#34;Katie only said a few harsh words-did you really have to hurt her purposely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned slowly, her eyes like frost.&#34;Hurt her purposely? Are you serious? Should we pull up the hospital&#39;s security footage and see who started what? I nearly fell because of her, and I didn&#39;t hurt her purposely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda faltered. &#34;But... I saw you just now-you stepped on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! This spiteful woman hurt me deliberately!&#34; Katie&#39;s voice cracked with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s expression didn&#39;t change. &#34;I didn&#39;t.But if you&#39;re so confident, I can ask the hospital director to pull the surveillance footage. Better yet,we can upload it and let the public decide.&#34;Her eyes swept over the two women, cold and fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s indignation surged, certain that Christina lacked access to the surveillance footage. She opened her mouth to argue, but Yolanda grasped her arm firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go,&#34; Yolanda whispered under her breath,her voice soft but pointed. &#34;Your brother and grandmother are both hospitalized. And don&#39;t forget-Christina is still y/our brother&#39;s ex-wife.There&#39;s no need to stir up trouble.&#34; She deliberately emphasized the word ex-wife,her tone sweet but laced with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie snorted, regaining composure swiftly,and then leveled a sharp glare at Christina. &#34;Don&#39;t mistake me for someone who&#39;s intimidated by you. Once my brother is discharged,you&#39;ll pay for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t respond. She simply turned around and walked away, heading straight to Bethel&#39;s ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Christina entered, Bethel&#39;s face lit up.&#34;Christina,seeing you makes my day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you doing?&#34; Christina responded gently, seating herself beside the bed and enveloping Bethel&#39;s hand in hers. &#34;Has your condition improved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Much better now. Had it not been for your careful care,I might have passed away long ago,&#34;Bethel said with a soft chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christinafrowned slightly, replying, &#34;Bethel,don&#39;t speak like that. You still have many years ahead-full of life and happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel laughed softly, her expression peaceful.&#34;At my age, I&#39;ve already lived more than enough.Even if I left now, I&#39;d have no regrets. But if l could live long enough to see your child come into this world, that would be a blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bethel...&#34; Christina lowered her eyes, her voice faltering.&#34;You know that Brendon and I... We&#39;re no longer...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel reached out and gently stroked Christina&#39;s head with her thin, wrinkled hand.&#34;I know. Brendon didn&#39;t cherish you the way you deserved. You&#39;re a remarkable woman, Christina.Brendon will regret the way he treated you one day. But when I said I wanted to see your child,I never meant it had to be Brendon&#39;s. Since being with him didn&#39;t bring you joy, then go on separate ways. I just want you to be happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Bethel, Christina had long since become more than just her grandson&#39;s former wife. She was family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bethel...&#34; Christina whispered, her throat tightening. Emotion swelled in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, sweetheart,&#34; Bethel said gently,giving her hand a firm squeeze. &#34;Even though Brendon turns his back on you, I never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel paused and then added quietly, &#34;I&#39;ve already made my will. If something happens to me,all my shares of the company wll go to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina froze, shocked. &#34;What? Bethel, what are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean it.&#34; Her tone was soft but resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my decision. Please don&#39;t try to talk me out of it.&#34; Her gaze turned serious. &#34;The Dawson Group carries generations of effort, love, and sacrifice. I cannot bear to see that legacy crumble under the hands of those incompetent ones of this family. My husband trusted me with most of the shares, and I intend to honor that trust by choosing someone worthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel exhaled. &#34;You must realize by now that no one in the Dawson family can manage the Dawson Group like you can. You&#39;re the only one I believe in. You&#39;re smart, calm, and kindhearted -everything the company&#39;s future head needs.I don&#39;t know how much time I have ahead of me,Christina.Life is full of uncertainties-you never know whether tomorrow or an accident will come first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words settled between them, Bethel&#39;s grip on Christina&#39;s hand tightened. &#34;Christina,promise me you&#39;ll run the Dawson Group after my decease,will you?&#34;</p>
