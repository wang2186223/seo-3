                <p>Dylan, usually so logical and quick-witted, found his mind going strangely blank as he listened to Christina. For a stretch of awkward silence, he said nothing at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina almost started to think he might refuse to help, but then his voice finally broke the tension. &#34;Of course. Which house do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief fluttered through her chest, and a sly little smile touched her lips. She cranked up the sugar in her voice. &#34;So you mean I get to pick any house I want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Go ahead-pick whatever catches your eye,&#34; Dylan answered smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A teasing melody wove through her words over the line. &#34;Hmm... Do you happen to have a house by the bay? I&#39;d like to move in tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do,&#34; Dylan replied without missing a beat. &#34;But there&#39;s also the one at Cloudcrest Heights. Why not stay there instead? It&#39;s got better views.Honestly, I think it&#39;d suit you more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a light, playful laugh, twirling a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>strand of hair around her finger. &#34;Oh, sweetheart,you really spoil me. But the bay mansion&#39;s perfect for now. We&#39;ll save the one in Cloudcrest Heights for after the wedding-our future love nest,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bayfront mansions started at fifty million, while the mansions in Cloudcrest Heights boasting panoramic ocean views easily soared past a hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina knew just flashing a deed to a bayfront mansion would be enough to make Brendon eat his heart out-she didn&#39;t even have to bring up the ultra-exclusive estate on Cloudcrest Heights,at least not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as &#34;Cloudcrest Heights&#34; rolled off her tongue, everyone around her sucked in a sharp breath, their eyes wide with disbelef before skepticism hardened their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Estates on Cloudcrest Heights weren&#39;t simply expensive-they were legendary, rarely traded,and off-limits to all but the most powerful. It wasn&#39;t about money alone. One needed influence that stretched behind closed doors. Even the Hubbard family-top of Dorfield&#39;s social food chain-barely managed to snag a single property,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and that was on the lowest rung of the mountain.The closer one got to the summit, the more unimaginable the owner&#39;s clout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group exchanged looks. Was Christina somehow tied to the Hubbard family? No way in hell! There was no way a family as distinguished as the Hubbard family would give a second glance to a divorced woman-let alone let her through their doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Dylan&#39;s low hum rumbled through the phone,smug and satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, darling! Can you send someone with the key and maybe help me move my things?&#34;Christina cooed,pouring on the sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No problem,&#34; Dylan replied, his smile so broad that it threatened to split his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice oozed syrupy affection as she purred, &#34;Hurry up, okay, darling? I&#39;m hanging up now-mwah, mwah! Love you!&#34; With one last exaggerated air kiss, she ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the line went dead, DDylan sat there,dazed and grinning like a fool. Her honeyed words kept echoing in his mind, replaying over and over,the smile on his face stretching impossibly wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still drifting in that warm, ridiculous afterglow when the door flew open and a voice cut through his daydream like a splash of cold water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan!&#34; Chloe&#39;s piercing call cut through his thoughts and anchored him to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, immediately smothering the stupid grin, though his cheeks still ached from holding it so long. Twisting his brow into a frown, he shot her a look of mild reproach. &#34;You didn&#39;t knock,&#34;he said, his voice clipped and cool-though there was a lingering softness that betrayed his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe huffed and crossed her arms, lips jutting into a pout. &#34;I did knock! You just didn&#39;t hear me.I walked right in and you were completely zoned out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, remembering the way he&#39;d been beaming like an idiot, she couldn&#39;t help but ask, &#34;Alright,spill. What happened? Why were you grinning like a total idiot just now? Something pleasant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help herself-she&#39;d never seen her stoic brother look so hopelessly happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Dylan responded with a noncommittal hum as he slipped on his suit jacket and headed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe trailed after him, her eyes gleaming with curiosity. &#34;What&#39;s got you so happy? Spill it-don&#39;t leave your dear sister in suspense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just wrapped up a big deal,&#34; Dylan answered briskly before grabbing his keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive wave, he went straight for the door and stated firmly, &#34;I&#39;m stepping out. You stay here and be good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dylan!&#34; she called, picking up her pace to keep up with him. &#34;Come on, what kind of deal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed him skeptically. No ordinary business win could have sparked that ridiculous smile-she was sure of it. Even the biggest contracts never made him beam like a fool. Clearly, he was hiding something. But no matter how she probed,the answer eluded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit stressing about my matters,&#34; Dylan remarked, slipping into his usual big-brother mode. &#34;Just worry about getting better-I&#39;ll handle everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe could see he wasn&#39;t going to budge. Once he clammed up, not even wild horses could drag</p>
                
                
                
                <p>the truth out of him. She watched him retreat down the hall, letting out a soft, frustrated sigh.&#34;If only Christina Were around,&#34; she ggrumbled to herself. &#34;She&#39;d have the secret out of him in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe hadn&#39;t known Christina for long, but something told her that woman could charm the truth out of anyone-even her stone-faced brother.</p>
