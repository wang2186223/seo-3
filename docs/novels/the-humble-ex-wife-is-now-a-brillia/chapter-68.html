                <p>Christina&#39;s lips curled into a cold smile as her eyes briefly flicked from Sheila to Yolanda, who clung to Brendon like a delicate porcelain doll.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, mocking smile tugged at Christina&#39;s lips.&#34;How generous of you,&#34; she said smoothly to Sheila.&#34;Though I must admit, your daughter&#39;s far better at playing the damsel in distress than l ever could be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila&#39;s expression darkened, her fury boiling over as she lifted her hand to slap Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina caught her wrist midair without flinching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie immediately surged forward to help Sheila, only for Christina to twist Sheila&#39;s arm and shove Sheila straight into Katie&#39;s path. A loud thud followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch-watch it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two crashed to the ground, limbs tangled,with Sheila landing hard on top of Katie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda and Joselyn hurried to help Katie and Sheila, panic and worry etched across their faces as they struggled to lift Katie and Sheila off the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stepped toward Christina, anger flickering in his eyes. &#34;Why do you always have to escalate things? Can&#39;t you just let it go for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina folded her arms, her gaze cool and unbothered. &#34;Maybe if you paid more attention,you&#39;d see who really started it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Must you always use that annoying tone to talk to me?&#34; he snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a slow, biting smile. &#34;Of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How else I am going to slice through the nonsense around here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at her, trying to rein in the frustration burning in his chest. &#34;Does it always have to be war between us?&#34; he asked finally. &#34;We could try... I don&#39;t know, at least being civil for once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina tilted her head, voice calm but cutting.&#34;Sure. Just keep your entourage in check. l don&#39;t start fights-I finish them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You started this mess!&#34; Katie shouted,brushing herself off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon took a step closer, his voice low and firm. &#34;Don&#39;t test me, Christina. I&#39;m trying to be reasonable, but you keep pushing it.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Is that all you have to say? If there&#39;s nothing else, then leave. Stop wasting my time,&#34;Christina said, turning slightly away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s jaw tightened as anger boiled beneath the surface. He&#39;d never found her so infuriating. &#34;You really want to go down this</p>
                
                
                
                <p>road?&#34; he said quietly. &#34;Because if you do,won&#39;t hesitate to tell the Jones family about the kind of company you&#39;ve been keeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile vanished. Her eyes darkened as she whipped around. &#34;Do it,&#34; she said,voice low and calm. &#34;Tell them. But don&#39;t think for a second that I&#39;m scared of your threats.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stared at her for a long moment before replying, his voice cold and calculated, &#34;You might not care about your own reputation, but dragging your family into this? Think very carefully, Christina. Some stains never wash off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay out of my business, Brendon!&#34; Christina snapped, reaching out to shove him out of her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to her shock, before she could make any contact, Brendon stumbled backward-his balance faltering-before his eyes rolled back and he crumpled to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head struck the ground with a sickening</p>
                
                
                
                <p>thud. The impact tore through the bandage on the back of his skull, and blood began to soak through, vivid and alarming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon didn&#39;t even flinch. He was already unconscious before the pain could catch up to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon!&#34; Joselyn cried out in panic, rushing to his side. Her face turned pale at the sight of the spreading red stain. &#34;Oh my God-he&#39;s bleeding! He&#39;s bleeding!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie shrieked, her voice rising in alarm,&#34;Someone call an ambulance! Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m calling!&#34; Yolanda fumbled with her phone, her fingers trembling. Her eyes brimmed with fear. With her father incustody and her family&#39;s company teetering on collapse,Brendon had become her last thread of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila pointed a shaking finger at Christina, her voice quivering with fury. &#34;You monster! Look at him! This is your doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina crossed her arms, unbothered. &#34;Are you serious right now? I didn&#39;t even touch him.He fell on his own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t try to weasel out of this!&#34; Sheila barked.&#34;This is your fault. You&#39;re paying for this-you won&#39;t leave until you do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila stormed toward Christina, hand outstretched to grab her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Sheila could get close, the deep growl of an engine cut through the chaos. A sleek black business car rolled up beside them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doors opened, and three tall men in black suits stepped out. They were broad-shouldered,stone-faced, and radiated quiet menace. Their sharp eyes swept the scene, making it instantly clear-they weren&#39;t just any men. They were professional bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila froze, her outstretched hand retreating instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie and Yolanda exchanged uneasy glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who were these men? Were they here for Christina?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three men approached Christina, stopped in front of her, and bowed in perfect unison.&#34;Miss Jones,&#34; they said in low, respectful tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, Yolanda, and Sheila felt their stomachs twist as the realization sank in. These men were Christina&#39;s people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the bodyguards stepped forward,his voice calm and assertive. &#34;We&#39;ve come to escort you home, Miss Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a small nod. &#34;Alright. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before leaving, she turned back to the trio with a smirk dancing on her lips. She lifted her hand and wiggled her fingers in a mocking wave. &#34;Try not to miss me too much,&#34; she said,her tone light but dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, Yolanda, and Sheila seethed in silence,their eyes locked on Christina&#39;s retreating figure. But none of them dared to move. None</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of them had the courage to speak up-especially not with those intimidating men around. Each of those bodyguards looked strong enough to knock someone out with a single blow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stepped into the sleek black car, and within moments, it pulled away, vanishing down the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in the seat, Christina closed her eyes and let out a deep breath, a satisfied smile on her lips. Yolanda might be good at playing the victim, but she could play that game, too-better, even. After all, life was nothing but a stage. And she had learned how to play her part perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Bayview Estates, Christina stood in front of the three bodyguards who had brought her home and a line of ten uniformed servants.&#34;Thank you for your service,&#34; she said warmly.&#34;And please extend my deepest gratitude to Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scott for arranging this on such short notice.I&#39;ll be sure to thank him in person when time permits. You may all leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, the entire line of personnel bowed in perfect unison.</p>
