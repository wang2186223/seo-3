                <p>With a swift jerk, Christina yanked her wrist free from Brendon&#39;s grasp, eyes narrowed and voice sharp. &#34;Try that again, and you&#39;ll regret ever laying a finger on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of backing down, Brendon found his irritation boiling over. He couldn&#39;t explain it, but it felt like control-something he&#39;d always taken for granted-was slipping through his fingers.&#34;This place doesn&#39;t suit you!&#34; he snapped, voice cold. &#34;No need to play dress-up just to make me look your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Christina laugh-sharp, humorless,and laced with contempt. &#34;Wow. You think this is about you? Don&#39;t delude yourself.We&#39;re finished. Whatever you think you still have a say in,you don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really what you want?&#34; Brendon asked,his stare hard and searching. &#34;To erase everything just likethat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you want the same?&#34; Christina retorted flatly. &#34;Don&#39;tforget, we&#39;ve already divorced.&#34;Brendon&#39;s hand twitched, and before he could stop himself, he reached for her again. But her reflexes were faster. With a crisp slap, she knocked his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit!&#34; Brendon recoiled, holding his wrist, fury flashing in his eyes. &#34;Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I am, at least I&#39;m not delusional,&#34; Christina said casually, her gaze drifting down tohis groin and back up with a derisive smirk. &#34;Though you might want to get yourself checked for any functional problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage twisted across his face. &#34;You&#39;ve got a real mouth on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Appreciate the compliment,&#34; Christina replied with a shrug, completely unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s anger flared even hotter. &#34;I came here to warn you because I didn&#39;t want to see you crash and burn. But if this is what you want,go ahead.Make your mess. I&#39;m done trying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying another word, Brendon spun on his heel and stormed off, his frustration echoing in each step. Christina&#39;s transformation hadn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gone unnoticed. Still, in his mind, it was nothing more than a flashy attempt to draw his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, more than a few men couldn&#39;t stop staring, their eyes tracking Christina like prey. She met their gazes with a look so sharp that it could cut glass, and whatever boldness they carried dissolved on the spot. Every spine stiffened. Whatever fantasy they&#39;d been brewing got snuffed out before it even formed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in that bar forgot what had happened earlier. Those foolish enough to touch her were left broken-one of them, quite literally,had his manhood destroyed. Nobody dared try again.Not after witnessing that brutal reminder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, inside a private, soundproof room tucked away from the crowd, two men silently observed the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan Scott leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing slightly as the striking Christina strode away from the scene, her presence drawing focus like gravity. Something about her brought back a name he hadn&#39;t spoken aloud in years</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rose. The masked woman who had  nearly shattered his pride at that shooting match four years ago.He could still picture the glint of her eyes behind the mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s got bite,&#34; Ralphy Graham, Dylan&#39;s friend,commented, his gaze flicking from the bar to Dylan. &#34;If Brendon picked a fight with her, he&#39;d be eating dirt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quiet authority in Dylan&#39;s posture was undeniable. He didn&#39;t need to speak to make his presence felt-his energy did the work for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy caught the flicker of interest in his friend&#39;s eyes and said, &#34;Don&#39;t tell me she&#39;s cracked that cold wall of yours. You thinking of pursuing her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shift in Dylan&#39;s expression sobered the air.&#34;Finding any leads on King is all I care about,&#34;he said evenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acrease formedon Ralphy&#39;sbrow.&#34;Stillnothing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan&#39;s features were drawn tight. &#34;Not a trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s like King disappeared off the face of the earth,&#34; Ralphy said, a note of frustration slipping into his voice. &#34;But King is the only one who can treat your sister. That hasn&#39;t changed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Dylan&#39;s grip tightened around his glass. &#34;Exactly. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll keep looking -no matter how long it takes.&#34; Without pause,he downed the entire drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shrill ringsliced through the room, breaking the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Ralphy reached for his phone and answered, looking composed at first.But within seconds, that calm shattered. His eyes lit up with sudden, electric excitement, and his posture shot upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan raised an eyebrow, voice steady.&#34;What could possibly rattle youlike that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended with a sharp tap. Ralphy turned to him,breathless with disbelief. &#34;It&#39;s about King.The shooting competition!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Dylan&#39;s face. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34; He hadn&#39;t expected King&#39;s name to be tied to a shooting competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy explained, nearly bursting, &#34;King just released a statement. Next week&#39;s champion of the shooting competition gets an opportunity for treatment-no expiry, just has to follow King&#39;s terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy almost bounced in his seat. The competition he hosted had just become the hottest event of the year because of King&#39;s announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No shit! Seriously?&#34; Dylan leaned forward, his voice dropping, but the edge in it sharp. &#34;Say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering certainty, Ralphy said,&#34;Whoever wins the shooting competition earns a treatment session from King. And Dylan,you&#39;ve been on top of the shooting competition for three years straight under the alias of Dillan.If anyone&#39;s walking away with that prize, it&#39;s going to be you!&#34;</p>
