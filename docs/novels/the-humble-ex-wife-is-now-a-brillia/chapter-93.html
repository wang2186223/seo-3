                <p>Brendon cast a nervous look at Christina,hoping she would play along and lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, however, had no plans to play his game. She calmly spilled out the truth. &#34;No.He&#39;s my ex-husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown crept across Brendon&#39;s face as he glared at her, barely containing his annoyance.He could never get used to how blunt she was.Instead of helping smooth things over, she always chose to be honest, no matter how uncomfortable it made everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin picked up on her words and offered Brendon a mocking grin. &#34;So, ex-husband,&#34; he said, his tone dripped with sarcasm. &#34;You&#39;re such a smooth talker. If Christina hadn&#39;t cleared things up, I might have actually thought you two were the picture-perfect couple, so loving and supportive of each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flush crept up Brendon&#39;s cheeks as the sting from Calvin&#39;s remark left him feeling exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Emmett, I think you misunderstand.Brendon has always been fair to Christina. He made sure she received what she was owed,&#34;Yolanda chimed in, her voice gentle as she tried to defend Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did he give her half of the family assets?&#34;Calvin asked, his tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The direct question took Yolanda by surprise,and she fell silent, unable to find a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin sneered, &#34;Who would care about that small amount? Even if you gave her half of everything, you&#39;re far from treating her fairly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin&#39;s eyes swept over everyone before finally settling on Brendon. It was clear that Brendon had no idea what he had lost. In truth, maybe letting Christina go was the most correct thing Brendon had ever done. Someone as remarkable as Christina needed a partner who could see her true worth. Judging by their</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clueless expressions, it was obvious they had no clue about Christina&#39;s discreet identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This thought brought the faintest smile to Calvin&#39;s lips. It seemed Christina hadn&#39;t planned to reveal she was actually the legendary healer,King. He could not wait for the day when they found out the truth. He imagined the shock on their faces would be unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You believe Christina has been treated unfairly? But Brendon has already given her five million and provided her with two houses.Wouldn&#39;t you say that&#39;s sufficient? Christina knows nothing aside from taking care of chores,and that&#39;s it. She has more than enough now to guarantee she can live well from here on out.&#34;Katie, unable to remain silent, quickly spoke up in Brendon&#39;s defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin&#39;s response was a chilly laugh. &#34;Some people&#39;s shamelessness knows no limits.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. Seriously? How did that make me shameless...&#34; Katie retorted, her words thick</p>
                
                
                
                <p>with contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katie!&#34; Brendon snapped, shooting her a furious glare. &#34;Can&#39;t you be quiet for a while?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon knew he had to stop Katie from running her mouth. Only a little while earlier,they had been apologizing profusely, and Calvin still hadn&#39;t forgiven them. If Katie kept stirring things up, she would only make matters worse for everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger simmered inside Katie, but she bit her tongue and said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr.Emmett, Christina accepted the settlement.At that time, I even considered giving her one more house,&#34; Brendon said, turning to Calvin and lowering his voice in an attempt to ease the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin looked at him, arching an eyebrow. &#34;Is that so? Which house did you have in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon managed a strained smile. &#34;It would be up to Christina. Whichever one she liked best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not the seaside villa atBayview Estates?&#34;Christina said, her response immediate and her voice carrying a chill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon tensed up for a moment, clearly surprised she would ask so directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie could not hold back her outrage. &#34;How could you even suggest that? That villa was supposed to go to Yolanda! Don&#39;t you have any shame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not like I begged you to give me anything,&#34;Christina replied, folding her arms and flashing them a small, knowing smile. &#34;Your brother was the one offering me a house and letting me choose. Now that l&#39;ve picked, you&#39;re angry about it? If you didn&#39;t want to give, you should&#39;ve kept quiet instead of acting generous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Katie&#39;s temper boiled over, and she nearly lunged at Christina before Brendon quickly stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon.&#34; Yolanda moved closer, her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>shimmering with tears that had not yet fallen.She spewed words she didn&#39;t mean at all again.&#34;If Christina desires that house, then just let her have it. Honestly, it&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t mind it.&#34;Pausing, she added, &#34;I am perfectly capable of earning money myself. However, the only thing Christina knows how to do is housework, and that is all. If she spends money recklessly, life outside might be tough for her. After everything she&#39;s done as a housewife for you for so many years,giving her a bit more is the least we can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin was ready to respond, but before he could speak, Christina&#39;s voice rang out,silencing the room.</p>
