                <p>As everyone assumed that the seemingly gentle Christina would be crushed by the fierce and wild Katie,what happened next shocked them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood still, her face unreadable. When the crowd assumed she was frozen with terror,she effortlessly lifted her hand and grabbed Katie&#39;s wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie struggled fiercely, but Christina&#39;s grip was unyielding. No matter how hard Katie tried,she couldn&#39;t break free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The onlookers&#39; perspective of Christina shifted.lt was only then that the onlookers realized this seemingly delicate woman was much stronger than she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie thrashed and fought, her frustration boiling over into visible rage. &#34;Release me!&#34; she hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie swung her leg in a desperate kick, but Christina effortlessly dodged, releasing one of Katie&#39;s hands in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a flash, Christina slipped behind Katie. With a quick step forward, she jabbed her knee sharply into the back of Katie&#39;s leg.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie gasped as sharp pain shot through her leg,and she collapsed onto her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A voice from the crowd broke the silence.&#34;Whoa!Did you see that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Applause burst out, followed by cheers and whispers all around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow! That was incredible! The gorgeous lady is so cool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wild woman looks like she&#39;s got money. Do you think the gorgeous lady will get in trouble for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That wild woman totally deserved that. Some people need to be put in their place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, I&#39;m a guy, and even I wouldn&#39;t have the guts to stand up to someone like that wild woman.The gorgeous lady isfearless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the big deal? You&#39;re all hyping that great-looking chick up way too much. She just beat me to intervene,nothing special,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? Then what stopped you from stepping earlier? At least the gorgeous lady had the guts to act. Is it so hard to admit someone else is better</p>
                
                
                
                <p>than you? People like you are all talk. Big words when it&#39;s over, but nowhere to be found when it counts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Katie snapped back to her senses,she was already down on her knees-her designer tights torn, her leg screaming with pain.Kneeling in front of a crowd was bad enough.And for her, who had been spoiled and revered her whole life, it was beyond degrading. She was used to watching others kneel, never imagining she&#39;d be in that position herself. Now, trapped in this humiliating pose as a sea of onlookers clapped and jeered, rage surged through her.How dare that wretched Christina disgrace her like this in public?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie struggled to rise, but her hands were still pinned tightly behind her back by Christina. A firm pressure on her shoulders forced her to bend forward, making resistance impossible. She couldn&#39;t even lift her head, let alone fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie was livid. That wicked Christina! It was no surprise-Christina was nothing more than a lowly servant, hardened by years of tough labor.Naturally, she possessed the raw strength to dominate so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; Katie snarled through clenched DT    MT teeth, her voice low and furious. &#34;If you don&#39;t let go right now, I swear you&#39;ll regret it!&#34;</p>
