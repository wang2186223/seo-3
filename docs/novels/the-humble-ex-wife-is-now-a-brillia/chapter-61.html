                <p>Christina&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver. With a faint, icy smile curling on her lips, she looked Katie dead in the eye. &#34;Call the police? Please. You don&#39;t have the guts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smug tone lit a fuse. &#34;You think I won&#39;t?&#34;Katie snapped.&#34;Watch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a casual shrug, her voice like ice.&#34;Be my guest. Go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by rage, Katie yanked out her phone.&#34;Just you wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Katie could press a button, Brendon stepped in and snatched the phone from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell, Brendon?&#34; Katie barked, furious.&#34;Give it back! She almost killed us-we have to report her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go,&#34; Brendon said firmly. &#34;We&#39;re still breathing,aren&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he didn&#39;t believe they were safe. Not with Christina standing there like nothing could touch her. Something about the calm in her eyes made his gut twist with fear. If they pushed her,who knew what she&#39;d do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let it go?&#34; Katie&#39;s voice cracked as it rose. &#34;We were almost killed! Are you seriously defending her? What, do you feel bad for her now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon...&#34; Yolanda stepped up beside him,her voice soft and eyes red-rimmed. She slipped her hand into his. &#34;I get it. Maybe we should just let it go. We owe her that much.Stirring up more trouble won&#39;t help anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda had hoped to play the gracious one-putting on a show of generosity to guilt Brendon into being harsher with Christina. But to her dismay, he gave her a gentle smile and lightly patted her head. &#34;You&#39;re always so understanding,Yolanda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s stomach twisted, but she forced a tender smile. &#34;Whatever you decide, I&#39;m with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; Brendon said simply and then turned to Katie, handing back her phone with a firm</p>
                
                
                
                <p>look. &#34;No one&#39;s calling the police. Understood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Finnegan had quietly pulled out his phone to involve the police, but Brendon&#39;s sharp gaze locked on him. He hesitated and then reluctantly slid it back into his pocket. If he didn&#39;t need the Dawson family as allies right now, he wouldn&#39;t be putting up with this circus at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Mitchells stood simmering in silence, their faces tight with restrained fury. Inwardly, they cursed Brendon-gritting their teeth at his cowardice, blaming him for this disgrace. If only they had someone stronger backing them,they wouldn&#39;t have been forced to swallow this humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina couldn&#39;t have cared less about their silent rage or whispered resentment.Whatever games they played in their heads didn&#39;t concern her. As long as they stayed out of her way, she wouldn&#39;t lift a finger against them. But if they pushed their luck, she&#39;d happily let them choke on the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the movers wrapped up, Christina headed toward the door without a backward glance.Brendon trailed behind her, stubbornly refusing to leave. He needed to see for himself. Part of</p>
                
                
                
                <p>him still believed she was bluffing. If she wasn&#39;t really moving into one of those luxury villas, it would confirm everything-this was just another desperate act to win him back. After all,women didn&#39;t go to such lengths unless they were still obsessed. And Christina had to be that kind of woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he convinced himself, the more self -satisfied he became. By the time he and the others reached the moving truck, his confidence was practically oozing from his smug grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s belongings were minimal, and the movers had already packed most of them. But one item made Brendon pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is that?&#34; Brendon asked,frowning at a massive syringe tucked neatly among her things. It looked bizarre-out of place. Was it some kind of weird bedroom toy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, that?&#34; Christina said with a shrug. &#34;It&#39;s for dealing with the garbage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s temper snapped. &#34;Christina! You&#39;re the garbage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned her head slowly and gave Katie a lazy smirk. &#34;Huh. I didn&#39;t name anyone, but if the shoe fits...&#34; Then, tapping her temple with a mockingly sympathetic look, she added, &#34;You might wanna get that checked out, though.Something tells me a few screws are loose up there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Katie sputtered, shaking with fury, her face flushed red as her temper boiled over.</p>
