                <p>Puzzlement etched itself across Christina&#39;s brow. She hadn&#39;t been here long-who would be seeking her out already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping outside, Christina shaded her eyes and tried to make out the figure at the gate.Ralphy stood there, his face a mask of nervousness as he peered into the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she&#39;d even crossed the courtyard,Ralphy was already calling to her through the gate. &#34;Miss Jones, could you please tell them to open the gate and let me in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile appeared on Christina&#39;s face as she nodded at the bodyguard. &#34;Go ahead-let him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick salute, the bodyguard complied at once. &#34;Of course, Miss Jones!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Ralphy as he finally stepped inside, brandishing a takeout container. &#34;Made it! I brought some food for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching an eyebrow, Christina couldn&#39;t resist teasing him, &#34;Why the special delivery, Mr.Graham? You could have sent someone else to do the errand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sheepish grin spread across Ralphy&#39;s face as he scratched his nose. &#34;Dylan had to rush off to a meeting, so he ordered me to deliver it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a light laugh. &#34;I suppose I should count myself lucky to be fussed over by the two of you.&#34; Her invitation was immediate. &#34;If you&#39;re hungry,you might as well join me for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Ralphy&#39;s eyes lit up and he nodded with exaggerated enthusiasm. &#34;Absolutely!haven&#39;t eaten a thing all day!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Dylan preparing a meal for Christina, Ralphy&#39;s hunger had flared-and without missing a beat, he quickly offered to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>handle the delivery. This clever move gave him the perfect excuse to stick around at Christina&#39;s place, ensuring he&#39;d get a taste of that mouthwatering food himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyebrows shot up in mild disbelief.&#34;Dylan actually cooked all this himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Ralphy replied,&#34;Naturally. That man&#39;s gone out of his way for you,Miss Jones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look crossed Christina&#39;s face.&#34;Then I&#39;ll need to find a way to thank him for the gesture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy shook his head, already prying open the containers. &#34;No thanks necessary. You&#39;re the reason Chloe has a fighting chance-if anything,the Scott family owes you. Hope is back in our house because of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled into her seat at the table. &#34;Any idea when he&#39;ll be finished with work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy gave a shrug, glancing at the clock. &#34;No</p>
                
                
                
                <p>idea. He&#39;s a workaholic-it could go on until late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Christina said quietly, leaving the conversation to drift away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Ralphy, unable to hide his ravenous hunger, made quick work of every dish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping his mouth, Ralphy grinned from ear to ear. &#34;You know, if it weren&#39;t for you, I&#39;d never get a bite of food this good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina responded with a gentle smile, &#34;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy just opened his mouth to speak when his phone began to buzz insistently. &#34;Sorry, let me grab this.&#34; He then answered without delay.&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the mischief drained from his features in a heartbeat, replaced by stark worry. Panic crept into his voice. &#34;What do you mean? What happened to Chloe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s heart skipped a beat, her own concern instantly showing on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Ralphy ended the call, Christina leaned in, her tone urgent. &#34;What&#39;s going on with Chloe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s answer was grim. &#34;She suddenly went blind. They&#39;ve already rushed her to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worried frown settled across Christina&#39;s forehead.&#34;We should go right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s move.&#34; Without hesitation, Ralphy nodded, any trace of lightheartedness replaced by a grim resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching his urgency, Christina&#39;s brows remained furrowed, her thoughts spinning. She had looked over Chloe&#39;s medical history-nothing had pointed to such a rapid decline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Ralphy broke the silence, anxiety tightening his voice. &#34;Has King been in contact with you at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a short nod. &#34;King&#39;s been in touch, saying the prescription for Chloe&#39;s cure is almost ready and just needs one last ingredient,But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy leaned in, nerves on edge. &#34;But what?What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of hesitation passed before Christina replied, &#34;The last ingredient is a rare find.Tracking it down could take a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s voice turned sharp, desperate for clarity. &#34;What&#39;s the name of this ingredient?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woodfort,&#34; Christina answered simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock was instant. &#34;Woodfort?&#34; Ralphy repeated, almost in disbelief. &#34;That&#39;s next to impossible to get. The Scott family once had one,but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finished the thought for him. &#34;But they don&#39;t have it anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret colored Ralphy&#39;s words. &#34;Exactly.&#34; He gripped the steering wheel tightly, recalling the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>past. &#34;When I was a kid, I nearly died and needed Woodfort to survive. Because my family and the Scott family were close, Dylan&#39;s grandfather gave his family&#39;s only piece to my grandfather. It saved me, but now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Self-reproach pressed down on him, his jaw clenched. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for me, Chloe might have already been getting the treatment she needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t shoulder all that blame. It was a life-or-death decision. Your family and the Scott family have always stood by each other-no one would have let you die,&#34; Christina said softly,trying to comfort him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotion thickened Ralphy&#39;s voice. &#34;Still... I can&#39;t help but feel like I stole Chloe&#39;s hope with my own survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of dread washed over Ralphy, the fear of losing Chloe gnawing at his every thought. The idea that her life might slip away because of him haunted him, a torment he knew he could never</p>
                
                
                
                <p>escape. If Chloe didn&#39;t survive-if her death was somehow his fault-it would break him in ways he couldn&#39;t begin to describe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice was soft, a gentle attempt at reassurance. &#34;Try not to let your worries consume you-sometimes, fate finds a way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy said nothing in return. The silence in the car thickened as he slammed his foot down on the accelerator, desperate to close the distance to the hospital. Every second that passed tightened the knot of anxiety in his chest, a constant terror that they might arrive too late.King had given them hope-a promise that Chloe could be cured. Yet now, everything felt as if it was slipping through their fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant they reached the hospital, both Ralphy and Christina hurried down the corridor not wasting a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s voice cracked with urgency as he flagged down Morse. &#34;What&#39;s happening? Tell me,how is Chloe? Where can I find her?&#34;</p>
