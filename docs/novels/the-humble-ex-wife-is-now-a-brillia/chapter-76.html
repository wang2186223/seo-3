                <p>&#34;Legal action? Please. Look at her-draped in designer labels, probably worth a fortune, If something happens, she&#39;ll just pay out a settlement and walk away without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s outrageously annoying! If I weren&#39;t stuck in this wheelchair, I&#39;d march over there and deliver a thunderous kick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shh! Honey, don&#39;t get reckless. We&#39;re just regular people. If you get into trouble, we&#39;d have to sell everything just to cover the damages. But for her? Even if she causes a death, any fine would be pocket change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s head snapped around to the woman in the wheelchair as the word &#34;kick&#34; reached her ears,her glare icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intimidated, the woman&#39;s husband quickly spun his wife away from Katie&#39;s line of sight, eager to escape any fallout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Baffled, the woman asked, &#34;Honey, what on earth are you doing? Don&#39;t wheel me away! I haven&#39;t even seen the end of this drama!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot her a warning look, voice low and urgent.&#34;Drama? The longer we stick around, the more likely we are to get dragged into it. Let&#39;s just keep</p>
                
                
                
                <p>our distance-save our money for your treatments instead of getting mixed up with people like her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman sighed in resignation but craned her neck anyway, bargaining. &#34;Fine, but at least stop somewhere I can still watch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s icy gaze lingered on the unconscious boy sprawled on the stretcher, her face unreadable. She pivoted back to Katie, her eyes now glinting with a lethal, wintry edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Christina closed the distance between them, her steps brisk and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s bravado faltered as she stumbled backward, eyes darting with alarm. &#34;What... What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing much.&#34; Christina&#39;s voice was silk over steel. In one swift motion, she seized Katie&#39;s wrist and dragged her aside in one fierce tug. &#34;Just making sure you get the fuck out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing her balance, Katie hit the floor with a bruising thud, yelping as she slammed down onto her rear end. &#34;You psycho! How dare you lay a hand on me!&#34; she bellowed, her face twisting with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina barely spared Katie a glance, cold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WAAgIe</p>
                
                
                
                <p>indifference written across her features. Then,she turned to the medical staff. &#34;Please do everything you can: I&#39;ll make sure Dr. Emmett gets here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the doctors and nurses doubted Christina could grab Calvin onto this case, something in her unwavering tone commanded their trust. Without another word, they rushed the stretcher into the waiting elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You despicable bitch! You hear me? You&#39;ll pay for this!&#34; Katie wailed, her shrill voice echoing down the hall as she flung herself at Christina,wild-eyed and vengeful, hell-bent on dragging Christina down with her.yutt</p>
