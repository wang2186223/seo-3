                <p>Christina studied Bethel quietly for a moment,her gaze gentle but unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noting Christina&#39;s silence, Bethel said, &#34;It&#39;s alright. If you&#39;d rather not take on the helm of the Dawson Group, I won&#39;t push it. I understand.I only decided to give those shares to you to give you a sense of security-something to fall back on in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel offered a faint smile, the corners of her lips tugging up with resignation. &#34;Even if I handed the shares off to that bunch of incompetent ones of the Dawson family, the Dawson Group would crumble anyway. Might as well give the shares to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s smile was soft but steady. &#34;Let&#39;s not talk about this now, Bethel. You&#39;re going to be fine. I&#39;m sure of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina couldn&#39;t bear the thought of losing Bethel just yet. Bethel had always treated her like family. The warmth, the fierce protection,the love-it had meant the world to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. We&#39;ll save it for another time,&#34; Bethel said with a light chuckle. She had already put her affairs in order. The will was written.Now,she simply lived each day with quiet acceptance,ready for whatever came next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I&#39;m discharged,&#34; Bethel added, voice calm, &#34;I&#39;ll transfer my family&#39;s estate to your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Christina could get a word in, the door to the hospital room flew open, crashing against the wall with a bang. A furious voice echoed through the room: &#34;Absolutely not! That estate is not going to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t need to turn around. That grating, self-righteous tone was unmistakable -Brendon,her ex-husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my decision,&#34; Bethel said icily, her voice cutting through the tension like glass. &#34;And no one gets to overrule it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stepped forward, ready to argue, but before he could get a word out, Yolanda clutched his wrist, reining him in. With a syrupy sweetness,she said to Bethel, &#34;Mrs. Dawson,are you feeling any better? I brought some health</p>
                
                
                
                <p>supplements for you-all the way from overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward with an elegant box and carefully placed it on the bedside table, her expression a mask of gentle concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s face hardened instantly. Her years of authority resurfaced in an instant, transforming her into the formidable matriarch she had always been. Her glare swept over Yolanda and the others like a blade. &#34;Who gave you the gall to bring this vile thing into my hospital room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda flinched, her eyes welling up with tears at the public humiliation. She blinked rapidly,voice trembling as she said, &#34;Mrs. Dawson, I know you&#39;ve never liked me, but must you be so harsh? If my presence offends you this much,I&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately brushed past Brendon as she made a move to leave. Predictably, he caught her by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yolanda, don&#39;t go.&#34; Even with the pain radiating from his still-bandaged head, his focus was solely on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go, Brendon,&#34; Yolanda whispered, her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>voice trembling, her eyes shimmering with tears,her acting skills shining through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Seeing her look so fragile-so unjustly treated-sent a pang through Brendon&#39;s chest.With aching tenderness, he reached out to wipe away her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon...&#34; Yolanda&#39;s voice trembled as she looked up at him, eyes glistening with gratitude and false vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the scene was shattered by Bethel&#39;s roar.&#34;Enough! Get out of my sight.Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda froze, her hands curling into tight fists at her sides. How dare this old hag humiliate her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s frustration erupted. He turned toward Bethel, face flushed, his voice rising. &#34;Why are you always so unfair to Yolanda?&#34; Then, with a sharp turn, his glare fell on Christina. &#34;Is it because she&#39;s been poisoning your mind?Whispering lies to turn you against Yolanda?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bethel&#39;s fury boiled over. With a resounding slam,her palm struck the bedside table. &#34;Watch your mouth, Brendon!&#34; she snapped. &#34;Not everyone&#39;s as twisted as you. Christina has never said a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>word against you guys. Never!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh really? Then explain your unwarranted hatred toward Yolanda!&#34; he barked. &#34;Why did you decide to give Christina the family estate when she&#39;s done nothing to deserve it?&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Brendon, it had always been painfully clear -Bethel favored Christina. That favoritism had festered in him like a wound, one that never healed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie stormed forward, her eyes locked on Christina with pure venom. &#34;You manipulative slut!&#34; she screamed. &#34;What the hell did you do to my grandma? Slip her something? Cast a damn spell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you calling a slut?&#34; Bethel&#39;s gaze snapped to Katie-cold,razor-sharp,lethal.Her voice was low now, controlled and cutting. The calm before the strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie faltered. That unblinking stare-it chilled her to the bone. And without thinking, she took two steps back, her bravado draining away like blood from her face.</p>
