                <p>At the bay-front villa, after ending the call,Christina turned back to the stunned group with a smirk tugging at her lips. &#34;Did you hear that?That&#39;s the kind of man I roll with,&#34; she said,eyes gleaming. &#34;And don&#39;t even get me started on this measly bay-front villa. If I felt like it,I could move into a mansion at Cloudcrest Heights before sunset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group stared at Christina in disbelief, but she didn&#39;t flinch. She knew if she so much as whispered a word as King, her hidden identity,the powerful elite of Cloudcrest Heights would be scrambling to hand her their keys and beg her to take their million-dollar properties off their hands. After all, she could do what no world-renowned doctor could: cheat death.She didn&#39;t sell medicine. She sold time. And to billionaires, a few more years of life was worth more than anything they owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, you&#39;re being reckless again,pretending to have a phone call with some affluent elderly gentleman,&#34; Yolanda said gently,her brows furrowed in mock concern as she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>made a subtle attempt to smear Christina&#39;s reputation. &#34;Be careful. Not everyone has good intentions, and some might leech onto you for life...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie rolled her eyes and jerked Yolanda aside.&#34;Are you stupid or what? Why are you still worried about her?&#34; she hissed. &#34;Let her crash and burn! If she wants to throw herself off a cliff, don&#39;t offer her a parachute!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, Yolanda!&#34; Joselyn cut in, her voice heavy with disdain as she shook her head.&#34;Don&#39;t waste your kindness on someone like Christina. Tramps like her don&#39;t see compassion -they see a stepping stone. She&#39;ll use your goodwill to claw her way up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan let out a scoff, lips curled in a sneer.&#34;She&#39;s clearly putting on a show. A mansion on Cloudcrest Heights? That was a dead giveaway that she&#39;s bluffing. Even the Hubbard family-the wealthiest in Dorfield-lives at the base tier.And she expects us to believe she could worm her way into their circle?&#34; He chuckled darkly.&#34;A divorced woman with no name and no backing? Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What no one knew-what Finnegan would never admit-was that he and his wife hadn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>come to town just to visit Brendon in his hospital bed. That was the excuse. Their true aim was the upcoming Hubbard banquet, which celebrated the joy of locating a long-missed daughter. The Mitchell Group was hemorrhaging money.One connection,one introduction,could save it. The Hubbards were the last rope keeping the Mitchell Group from collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now there were whispers-dangerous whispers-that Samuel Graham, a kingmaker from the Dorfield, would be attending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan doubted Christina had any connection with the Hubbard family. Unless, of course, she was the long-lost daughter the Hubbards were preparing to welcome home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan nearly laughed aloud at the thought.He had his own sources. Christina wasn&#39;t even a blip on the Hubbard radar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone knows that the people who live on Cloudcrest Heights aren&#39;t just rich. They&#39;re untouchable,&#34; Sheila added, her nose tilted arrogantly.If someone like Christina could charm her way into that circle, then her daughter would&#39;ve been the Hussain family&#39;s mistress a long time ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s not forget-this house? Christina only got to live in it because of my brother. Now she&#39;s dreaming of Cloudcrest Heights? Delusional doesn&#39;t even begin to cover it.&#34; Katie folded her arms and leaned in with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m staying right here,&#34; Katie snapped, arms crossed defiantly. &#34;Christina, let us see how long you actuallylast in this neighborhood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Katie, this was just another one of Christina&#39;s desperate charades-some pitiful attempt to save face with a well-rehearsed lie. The mansions in this neighborhood were worth tens of millions. How could a jobless, cast-off slut like Christina afford even a corner of one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Katie&#39;s eyes, Christina was beneath her.Pathetic. Unworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina didn&#39;t flinch. She cocked a brow,amusement dancing in her eyes. &#34;So that&#39;s it?You&#39;re all really going to welch on a bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan flinched. &#34;W-what bet? We didn&#39;t agree to anything like that-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did,&#34; Christina said coolly. &#34;Each of you-one milion. That was the deal. Now, pay up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze slid to Brendon like a dagger dipped in silk. &#34;Hey, care to be chivalrous and cover their bill?&#34; she said, voice dripping with mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s brows knotted. &#34;What the hell is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t bother answering. She didn&#39;t need to. &#34;A bet&#39;s a bet. A debt&#39;s a debt,&#34; she continued, her tone ice-cold. &#34;If five million&#39;s too much for you to stomach, that&#39;s fine. Just don&#39;t blame me when this hits the internet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stare swept over the group like a blade.&#34;You have 24 hours. One day. If I don&#39;t see that money in my account by then...&#34; She leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper. &#34;I will go public.&#34; Her smile was wicked. &#34;And when Mitchell and Dawson stocks start tanking, five millionwill look like pocket change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything Brendon had put her through,Christina felt she had shown more mercy than any of these people deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s voice sharpened, frustration seeping in as he turned to his mom and the others.&#34;What the hell happened here?&#34; Since Christina refused to elaborate, he sought answers elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan let out an exaggerated sigh, as if the weight of Christina&#39;s words were some unbearable injustice. &#34;Brendon, don&#39;t let her manipulate you. There was no bet-she&#39;s making it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s just-&#34; Joselyn tried to badmouth Christina, but the moment Brendon&#39;s glare snapped to her, she fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Brendon&#39;s voice was sharp, clipped.His eyes settled on Yolanda. &#34;Tell me the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda felt her throat tighten. She wanted-desperately-to twist the story, but one look at Brendon told her it would be useless.Worse-Christina had proof, that damned surveillance footage...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon...&#34; Yolanda&#39;s voice cracked as she slipped into her theatrical acting again. &#34;We did make a bet with Christina. And we...We lost.&#34;Tears brimmed in her eyes, and when she looked at him, it wasn&#39;t just guilt-it was fear.&#34;I&#39;m... I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s jaw clenched. His eyes narrowed as he scanned the group with disdain. &#34;You lost, so pay what you owe. Or are you really trying to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cheat your way out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Histonedripped	with	contempt.Their shamelessness didn&#39;t just disgust him-it embarrassed him, especially in front of Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-no! Of course not!&#34; Yolanda stammered,her fingers fumbling for her phone. &#34;I&#39;ll transfer it-right now. Please, Brendon, don&#39;t be angry</p>
