                <p>The bodyguards, rigid and unreadable just moments before, now quaked with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aylin stepped forward, bowing to Christina.&#34;Miss Jones, we were all assigned by Mr. Scott to serve you. If you let us go, we&#39;ll all lose our jobs...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, don&#39;t turn us away! Without this job, I don&#39;t know how my family will survive. My husband&#39;s illness is rare-the medication costs a fortune, and it&#39;s only available overseas. If I&#39;m fired, my family will fall apart. My daughter&#39;s always been devoted, and she&#39;d never walk out on me or my husband, but I don&#39;t want to be a burden to her...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaming, Aylin added, &#34;Miss Jones, I&#39;m begging you-give me any task, no matter how hard. Just let me work for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chorus of desperate voices echoed her plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Miss Jones, don&#39;t dismiss us! We nave nowhere to go-we&#39;re pleading with you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, the household staff spilled their stories, each more heartbreaking than the last.Every family seemed to be hanging by a thread.If their words held any truth, losing this job would destroy them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the coincidence nagged at Christina-could every one of them truly be so desperate?A crease formed between her brows. &#34;That&#39;s not going to happen. If you leave here, you won&#39;t be out of work. Weren&#39;t you all Scott family staff to begin with? If you go back to provide service, I&#39;m sure the Scott family will take you back. Why would you end up unemployed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aylin&#39;s voice trembled, eyes growing glossy.&#34;Miss Jones, it&#39;s not that simple. Once the Scott family sends someone away to serve elsewhere,there&#39;s no going back. If we&#39;re not needed anymore, it&#39;s as if we&#39;ve been banished for qood.The pay offered by the Scott family is the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>highest we&#39;ll ever see, and after working here,no other rich family would trust us-they&#39;d think we&#39;re spies or have our own agenda. Landing another decent job just isn&#39;t possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina considered the Scott family&#39;s rigid structure. She&#39;d always known they were strict,but she hadn&#39;t realized the rules were this unforgiving. Still, for a family wielding such influence, it fit. Even among relatives, rivalries ran deep-if siblings could turn on each other,what chance did outsiders have? The Scott family&#39;s oppressive rules were nothing new.Their relentless vigilance was likely the very reason they&#39;d managed to maintain their power for generations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Christina had no intention of keeping so many people around-especially when she had no plans to live here for long. This mansion wasn&#39;t truly hers, just a place she used to show to Brendon and his crew that she was flourishing on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Miss Jones, don&#39;t take away our only</p>
                
                
                
                <p>means of survival!&#34; Aylin pleaded, her tears spilling unchecked down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moved by their desperation, Christina finally gave in. &#34;Fine. You can stay here for now. I&#39;ll talk to Dylan and see if something can be worked out for all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved to try convincing Dylan to bring the staff back into the Scott family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Miss Jones! We&#39;ll give you our absolute best and never betray your trust!&#34; Aylin promised, her gratitude shining through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re grateful for your generosity, Miss Jones!Our loyalty is yours!&#34; the rest of the staff chimed in, their unified voices ringing out with a fierce, almost ceremonial resolve, as if they were reciting an oath in a period drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Christina been born in another century,she might have mistaken their devotion for the kind that sparked revolutions, ready to charge into battle at her command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on, you&#39;re dismissed for now,&#34; Christina said, pinching the bridge of her nose as a dull ache started to build behind her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone and dialed Dylan&#39;s number, only to be met with a dead line. A flicker of annoyance crossed her face, but she chose not to dwell on it-she&#39;d circle back to it with Dylan when the moment felt right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her stomach let out a loud, impatient growl, making her painfully aware she&#39;d skipped breakfast in all the earlier chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could hunt down something to eat, a servant stepped forward, bowing with careful deference. &#34;Miss Jones, there&#39;s a visitor outside requesting to see you.&#34;</p>
