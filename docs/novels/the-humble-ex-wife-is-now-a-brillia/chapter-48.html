                <p>Morse dropped his voice, speaking in a hushed whisper into the phone. &#34;I&#39;ve figured out a trick to get Dylan to cook.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy shot to his feet, his emotions flaring again.&#34;Really? What trick? Tell me right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh? Didn&#39;t you say you would get back at me for not messaging you about Dylan&#39;s cooking just a minute ago?&#34; Morse&#39;s lips curled in a sly,triumphant grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, Ralphy&#39;s whole demeanor shifted-he flashed a wide, obsequious smile. &#34;I was just kidding! I swear, I didn&#39;t mean any of that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morse arched an eyebrow and flashed a teasing smile. &#34;So what does that make me,then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy&#39;s eyes darted before he plastered on an eager grin. &#34;You&#39;re my boss. Whatever you say goes, all right? I&#39;ll do anything-just tell me the trick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Ralphy, losing a touch of pride was a small sacrifice for the meal made by Dylan with his own</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hands.Learning what it took to get Dylan to cook was priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, please, what&#39;s the secret?&#34; Ralphy pleaded, grinning shamelessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morse burst out laughing at Ralphy&#39;s pathetic display. &#34;Are you really willing to do anything lask just for a shot at Dylan&#39;s cooking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely! Name it, I&#39;ll do it! Now quit stalling and tell me already!&#34; Ralphy bounced on his heels, nearly bursting with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morse leaned in, smirking. &#34;Well, since you&#39;re so eager... Let&#39;s talk about your family&#39;s assets for a second...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Ralphy jumped in with an eager shout. &#34;Boss! Everything I have is yours-take it all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ralphy barely got the words out before a cane came crashing down across his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Ow-hey!&#34; A sharp yelp escaped Ralphy as pain shot up his back. He whipped around, face blazing with anger. &#34;Who the hell just hit me? Are you looking to die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as Ralphy caught sight of the culprit,his bravado collapsed. The words tangled in his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>throat. His voice went small and uncertain.&#34;Grandpa...&#34; He summoned up a nervous grin,trying to play it cool. &#34;Uh, what brings you here all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel Graham, Ralphy&#39;s grandfather, scowled,digging his cane into the floor. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t shown up, you&#39;d have handed over the entire family to someone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy let out a weak, awkward chuckle,desperate to defuse the situation. &#34;Come on, I was just kidding...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s scowl only deepened. He raised his cane again,threatening another whack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panicking, Ralphy blurted out, &#34;Dylan&#39;s cooked today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stopped Samuel mid-swing.&#34;What the hell did you just say? Dylan&#39;s cooked today?&#34; he echoed,his irritation momentarily forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy bobbed his head up and down, scrambling to keep the peace.&#34;Yeah!l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel didn&#39;t let Ralphy finish. In a flash, he snatched Ralphy&#39;s phone and shoved Ralphy out of the way. &#34;Out of my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ralphy stumbled back, barely catching himself as</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel claimed his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s tone flipped to warmth as he addressed the screen, &#34;Morse, have you guys finished washing the dishes over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Momentarily startled, Morse responded, &#34;Mr.Graham,all the dishes are washed and put away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s expression shifted, smoothing into an ingratiating smile. &#34;Morse, you know l&#39;ve always treated you well, haven&#39;tl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Mr. Graham. You&#39;ve always been very generous,&#34; Morse replied, his fingers pushing up his gold-rimmed glasses. He could already tell where this conversation was headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on cue, Samuel leaned in closer to the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;About that trick you mentioned earlier...Would you mind sharing it with me?&#34; His smile stretched even wider, thick with expectation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By this time, Ralphy had recovered from his shock and was hovering nearby, craning his neck to catch every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, Morse quietly toggled his phone camera from the front to the rear lens, panning around the room before letting the frame settle</p>
                
                
                
                <p>on the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the shot, two people sat comfortably, sipping coffee.Dylan lounged in an armchair, his features locked in a cold, unreadable mask. Beside him sat a young woman, poised and composed, her face entirely unfamiliar to Samuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s eyes narrowed with intrigue. &#34;Who&#39;s that woman over there? She&#39;s just sitting there having coffee with Dylan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, genuine surprise flickered across Samuel&#39;s normally unflappable face. He leaned in,peering at the screen, silently sizing up the woman with growing interest. Someone who could sit so naturally across from Dylan-unfazed,perfectly at ease-had to be remarkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know!&#34; Ralphy couldn&#39;t contain himself.He shot his hand into the air, practically bouncing in his seat. &#34;Grandpa, that&#39;s Christina! I&#39;ve told you about her-she&#39;s the one who beat Dylan and won the prize of King&#39;s treatment. She struck a deal with Dylan, and now, thanks to her,Chloe actually has a shot at being healed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel&#39;s keen eyes stayed locked on Christina,sizing her up with the practiced scrutiny of a man who missed nothing. He took note of the way she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sat-poised, unafraid, utterly unfazed by Dylan&#39;s presence. Clearly, she wasn&#39;t someone ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow realization dawned on Samuel. Any woman who could best Dylan in a shooting competition wasn&#39;t just impressive-she was exceptional.</p>
