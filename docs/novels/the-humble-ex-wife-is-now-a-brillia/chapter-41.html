                <p>Christina let out a dry, bitter laugh, her fury barely held in check. Brendon had paraded around with Yolanda without a care in the world, ignoring every judgmental glance thrown their way. But she, his ex-wife, was still expected to play the role of a dutiful Dawson and guard their reputation simply because their divorce hadn&#39;t been made public? What kind of nonsense was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then hold a press conference tomorrow to announce our divorce,&#34; Christina said, her voice sharp with mockery. &#34;Better yet, call the reporters right now. Make it public today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s jaw tightened, a vein throbbing at his temple. &#34;Is that how desperate you are to sever all ties with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina met his glare with one of her own.&#34;Absolutely. Being connected to you is nothing but a disgrace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Brendon was so enraged that he couldn&#39;t find the words to respond. How had he never noticed before just how sharp-tongued Christina could be? Her words hit like punches-hard, fast,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>and impossible to dodge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I owe your family nothing, Brendon,&#34; Christina said, her tone like ice. &#34;The moment we signed those divorce papers, I was done with all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had refrained from retaliating against the Dawson family for only one reason: Bethel,the woman who had once saved her life. She wasn&#39;t the type to forget a debt. But if the Dawson family kept pushing her, she wouldn&#39;t hold back anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, do you really have to act this way?&#34;Brendon asked, frowning deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a cold laugh, eyes narrowing. &#34;This way? Don&#39;t pretend to be the victim. You started this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know things weren&#39;t that simple,&#34; Brendon insisted. &#34;None of us chose this situation. Not me,not Yolanda, not even you. I never meant to hurt you.Can&#39;t we at least be civil? I&#39;ve always tried to treat you fairly. Plus, didn&#39;t | compensate you enough for the divorce-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Christina snapped, lifting a hand to silence him. &#34;I don&#39;t want your justifications. I&#39;m tired,Brendon.I want to go home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped in front of her, blocking her path.&#34;You&#39;re not leaving until you answer me. Who were you with last night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then pulled out his phone and showed her a photo-grainy, taken from a distance. It showed her stepping out of a sleek black car. The license plate was cropped out, and the driver&#39;s identity hidden, but it was enough to fuel his suspicions.He&#39;d been restless ever since he saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon, why are you wasting your energy on her?&#34; Katie scoffed, striding forward with a sneer.&#34;She&#39;s just starving for attention.&#34; Her tone grew nastier with every word. &#34;She&#39;s throwing herself at any guy who&#39;ll look at her-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shot Katie a glare so cold that it made her flinch. Her crude words made his stomach turn. How could someone from such a respectable background talk like that? Who had she been hanging around?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon turned back to Christina, his voice lower but firm. &#34;Just tell me who you were with last night. If you explain, I&#39;ll believe you&#39;re innocent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina let out a sharp laugh, tilting her head as though she&#39;d just heard the most absurd thing imaginable. &#34;I don&#39;t owe you any explanations,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon. We&#39;re divorced. You have no right to question how I live my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s face darkened. &#34;So this is what you&#39;ve become? You&#39;ve lost all sense of dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina raised an eyebrow, a small, mocking smile curving on her lips. &#34;Dignity? If you&#39;re looking for shame, maybe try searching your own family first.&#34; Her eyes flicked to Katie-just for a second-but it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie flinched. Her spine went rigid, and her breath caught in her throat. &#34;W-Why are you looking at me like that?&#34; she asked, her voice trembling. &#34;I haven&#39;t done anything wrong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a soft chuckle. &#34;Maybe you haven&#39;t. Or maybe you have. Only a proper investigation can say for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina hadn&#39;t planned on involving Katie. But Katie had been asking for it-poking and insulting her.She had only responded in kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon, don&#39;t listen to her!&#34; Katie cried, panic creeping into her voice. &#34;She&#39;s just trying to cause drama. I&#39;ve always followed our family&#39;s values-I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon turned to her slowly, his gaze</p>
                
                
                
                <p>unreadable. &#34;Are you absolutely certain about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; Katie replied too quickly. &#34;I&#39;m your sister, Brendon. Are you really going to take her word over mine?&#34; She pointed at Christina,pointing accusingly. &#34;She&#39;s just jealous. She can&#39;t stand seeing us happy. She mocks Yolanda every chance she gets...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That struck a nerve. Brendon hesitated, thinking back to Christina&#39;s cold remarks about Yolanda.The suspicion in his eyes began to fade. &#34;That&#39;s enough, Christina,&#34; he said, his voice firm. &#34;I don&#39;t believe a word you say. You&#39;re not going to drive a wedge between me and my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave him a cold look. &#34;Believe whatever helps you sleep at night.&#34; Then, with a sudden shove,she pushed him aside. &#34;You&#39;re in my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stumbled back, caught off guard by her strength. His foot slipped, and he nearly fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon!&#34; Katie rushed to his side, grabbing his arm to steady him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he regained his balance, Christina was already walking away-her head held high,her steps light and sure, like she hadn&#39;t a care in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina! Stop right there!&#34; Brendon shouted,frustration crackling in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina didn&#39;t stop. She didn&#39;t even glance back. Divorce hadn&#39;t dimmed her. If anything, it had unleashed something stronger, something untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s heart ached with something he couldn&#39;t name. A hollow feeling gnawed at him as he watched her disappear into the distance. His chest tightened, and without thinking, he took a step forward, striding after her.</p>
