                <p>Brendon froze at the sound of Christina&#39;s laughter. His brows pulled tight. &#34;What the hell are you laughing at?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s snapped!&#34; Katie shrieked, fear sharpening her voice. &#34;She&#39;s been a ticking time bomb since day one-just throw her in a damn asylum already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda hesitated, wringing her hands as if she were offering a piece of wise advice instead of plotting against Christina. &#34;Maybe something set Christina off. We should take her to a hospital. Let a doctor-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hospital?&#34; Finnegan cut in with a snort.&#34;Hell no!She&#39;s insane. What she needs is a padded cell and a straitjacket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s laughter died,replaced by a deadly calm.&#34;You think I&#39;m the crazy one?&#34; Her voice was low, chilling. &#34;No. I&#39;m the sole clear one here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her eyes locked with theirs,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>something in them recoiled. They backed up-all of them</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone like you should be locked in a padded cell!&#34; Katie spat, her voice sharp with venom</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie hated Christina&#39;s guts. This conniving bitch knew too much, even including skeletons deep in her cupboard. Besides, every step Christina took chipped away at her plans. Christina had to be erased. Crushed. Eliminated-whatever it took</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by that thought, Katie snapped, &#34;Hold her down! I&#39;m calling the asylum. Let them deal with her madness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina responded with a laugh-chill and dripping contempt, &#34;You? Take me down?Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t you ever just surrender? Why is it always a goddamn war with you?&#34; Brendon snarled, voice ragged with rage. &#34;Say you&#39;re sorry, and I&#39;ll act like none of this ever happened.&#34; His tone was low and dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Brendon truly craved wasn&#39;t peace-it was control. He wanted to see Christina break. To</p>
                
                
                
                <p>watch that fire in her eyes fade, replaced with the same docile obedience she reserved for those old men she charmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apologize?&#34; Christina scoffed, her smirk razor -sharp. &#34;You think you deserve that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mocking curl of her lips sent Brendon over the edge. His hands closed around her throat,grip unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s face turned scarlet as her breath hitched, the air cut off, her body trembling beneath the weight of his fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon wanted her to feel it-that creeping,breathless panic. If brute force was what it took to break her, then so be it. How could he let this stubborn little woman keep disrespecting him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, the massive movers stood still,muscles taut, eyes locked on the chaos.Only Christina&#39;s earlier glance-a silent command layered with warning-kept them from intervening and leaping into the fray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about now, Christina?&#34; Brendon growled,his jaw clenched, shaking her with barely restrained fury. &#34;Still think we don&#39;t deserve it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a slow, merciless smirk-cool, composed, and cutting &#34;Not Even Close&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ease of her contempt, the unshaken confidence in her gaze-it ignited Brendon&#39;s fury like gasoline on fire. His fingers dug in tighter, joints creaking, skin stretched bone-white with rage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sidelines, Katie and the others basked in the moment, faces lit with vindictive glee.Finally, someone was clipping Christina&#39;s wings.How was Christina going to act high and mighty now? They stood there watching,like vultures circling roadkill. The movers stood like statues -pathetic,paralyzed,hiding behind silence and uniforms. Cowards, every last one. Not a soul among them dared defy the Dawsons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with smug adrenaline, Katie stepped forward. Her eyes gleamed with cruel satisfaction, lips curled in triumph. She raised her hand and swung-ready to mark Christina&#39;s face-but pain bloomed across her gut instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahh!&#34; Katie&#39;s scream ripped through the room as she collapsed, limbs folding awkwardly beneath her. She hit the floor with a sickening thud,gasping, clutching her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katiel&#34; Yolanda shrieked, scrambling to her knees beside Katie, panic etched in every line of her face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda spun on Christina, voice cracking &#34;Why did you kick her like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s expression was ice. &#34;If you&#39;re so concerned, then why don&#39;t you take her place and let me kick you instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina ..&#34; Yolanda whispered, apparent rawness bleeding into her voice. &#34;Do you still hate me that much?&#34; She took a breath that rattled in her chest and then stepped forward,trembling. &#34;If you need to let it out-your anger,your grievance-take it out on me. I won&#39;t fight.Scream, hit, whatever you want. I deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina tilted her head, studying Yolanda. Then,her face twisted into something colder than contempt. &#34;Why would I waste my energy on you? Even touching you would make me feel dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insut landed like a blade. Yolanda&#39;s mouth trembled, and tears spilled unchecked down her cheeks. She looked utterly broken-like a porcelain doll cracked beyond repair,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>abandoned and ashamed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sight struck Brendon like a punch to the chest Something twisted deep inside him His gaze snapped to Christina, dark and thunderous,fists clenched. &#34;You got a death wish, Christina?&#34;he growled, his voice coiled with venom</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands, which had momentarily slackened,clamped down again-sudden and brutal, like a steel trap snapping shut</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina didn&#39;t recoil. Her eyes met his with a ferocity that burned cold. &#34;No,&#34; she whispered,lips curling. &#34;But it surelooks like you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barely tilted her head-just a subtle cue-and suddenly, those towering, muscle-bound movers jumped on Brendon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; Brendon didn&#39;t even get a full breath before a hand like a steel trap snapped around his neck. His lungs collapsed inward. Darkness crept at the edges of his vision as panic surged to the surface. He wasn&#39;t choking Christina anymore. Now he was the one clawing for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s hands beat against his captor&#39;s arm,fists pounding helplessly against muscle that might as well have been concrete. His captor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>didn&#39;t even blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon!&#34; Yolanda lunged forward-only to be snatched mid-step. Another mover hoisted her up by the throat, her heels scraping for purchase that didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every one of them-dragged off the floor like rag dolls. Legs kicked. Fingers scratched. But it was like watching insects caught in the jaws of lions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L-Let. . go.,. please..&#34; Katie choked out the words, her voice strangled, her face contorted in terror. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she fought with every ounce of strength she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kicked. She writhed. But her captor&#39;s grip was inhuman-unyielding. Her lungs screamed.Her limbs weakened. The black haze pulled tighter around her, whispering finality. What the hell? No! She couldn&#39;t accept it! She refused to die here. Not in this place. Not like this.There was still a life waiting for her-glamour, wealth,indulgence.She was meant for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a final burst of fading energy, Katie clawed at the fingers around her neck, her mouth to make a bid of screaming. &#34;H-Help!&#34;</p>
