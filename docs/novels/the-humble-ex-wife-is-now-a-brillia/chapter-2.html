                <p>In the Vertbrook Bar, Christina slíd off her black -rimmed glasses and tucked them into her hands. Without them, her eyes sparkled with mischief and warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the flat, straight hair she always wore like armor.Now it flowed in waves, framing her face like she belonged on the cover of a magazine. With that red lipstick and confident glow, she turned heads without trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved like someone who&#39;d shed a skin.Whatever plain, quiet version of herself used to exist at home-she wasn&#39;t here tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina leaned in, swirling the straw in her cocktail. &#34;Hey, there&#39;s a shooting match next week. You thinking of signing up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a chance,&#34; Christina replied without missing a beat. &#34;It&#39;s been forever. My hands aren&#39;t as steady as they used to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, who cares?&#34; Davina flashed a teasing grin. &#34;Use it to blow off some steam.Picture Brendon&#39;s face on the bullseye and go full demolition mode.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low chuckle slipped out as Christina brought her glass to her lips. &#34;That&#39;s tempting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right?&#34; Davina grinned, her tone rising with excitement.&#34;Oh-and guess who&#39;s going to be there? Dillan. The guy who almost knocked you out four years ago. You bailed, and now he&#39;s been hogging the spotlight ever since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina didn&#39;t wait for Christina to respond as she added, &#34;And get this-the prize this year is a custom Bugatti. Not a model you can just go out and buy. One of a kind.&#34; She passed her phone to Christina wvithout missing a beat. &#34;Here.Take a look at the competition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina flipped through the details in seconds.The prize money wasn&#39;t the only thing catching her attention. What really stood out was the twist-contestants would be hidden behind masks and aliases. But whoever came out on top? They&#39;d get to force the others to show their real faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you enter and win, you haye to make Dillan take off his mask.I need to know what that guy looks like!&#34; Davina exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Christina gave her wineglass a gentle swirl. The corners of her mouth curled into a teasing grin. &#34;If I show up, I&#39;m not just going to play. I&#39;m going to raise the stakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina tilted her head, curiosity sparking in her eyes. &#34;Alright then, tell me-what exactly are you thinking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shot Davina a sly grin. &#34;Let everyone know-whoever takes the crown this year gets a personal session with King. No expiry date,either. As long as they meet King&#39;s terms, the deal stands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Davina nearly spilled her drink. &#34;You&#39;re kidding!If that gets out, people are going to crawl over each other just to sign up. This thing&#39;s about to blow up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading to the restroom.&#34; Without another word,Christina rose from her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t make it far before a small crowd of men stepped into her path, their swagger loud enough to silence the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look what we&#39;ve got here,&#34; one of them said, grinning. &#34;You look like you could use</p>
                
                
                
                <p>some company. How about a drink?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They leered at her, scanning her from head to toe like she was something they could own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ice filled Christina&#39;s gaze. Hervoice dropped like a warning. &#34;Move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only seemed to encourage them. &#34;Feisty,&#34;one of them said with a chuckle. &#34;We like a girl who makes things interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Last chance. Get out of my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of stepping out of her way, one of them whistled,reaching out a hand toward her chest with a lewd grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took. Christina snapped his wrist before his fingers even brushed her. The sickening crunch made the whole group freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man yelped, &#34;What the hell&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other men didn&#39;t get the chance to retaliate.Christina moved like a storm. A kick to the knee.An elbow to the jaw. One by one, she dropped them with cold precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, the entire group lay sprawled across the floor, groaning and clutching bruises they&#39;d remember for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, the second floor balcony overlooked the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That woman&#39;s a knockout,&#34; one of Brendon&#39;s buddies said, his jaw practically on the floor.&#34;Cool,confident-exactly my type.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s gaze drifted to the woman with the wavy hair, and the longer he stared, the stronger thesense of recognition grew. There was somethingin her face-something uncanny -that made him wonder if he was looking at Christina,his ex-wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending the afternoon at the hospital with Yolanda,Brendon had agreed to hit the bar on her suggestion. Blowing off steam/ sounded harmless-until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on a second,&#34; Yolanda murmured,squinting at the woman downstairs. &#34;Isn&#39;t that Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, you&#39;re telling me that knockout is actually Christina? Get out of here. That can&#39;t be the same dull housewife who barely spoke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity sparked in the group as they leaned in,squinting for confirmation. Recognition settled in fast-it really was Brendon&#39;s ex-wife, and the shock hit them like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie Dawson, Brendon&#39;s younger sister, didn&#39;t hide her disdain. &#34;Look at her-dressed like she&#39;s auditioning for attention. I guess getting dumped made her desperate. Bet she&#39;s prowling for a sugar daddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group laughed, quick to follow her lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Typical,&#34; someone sneered. &#34;Women like that only know how to latch onto a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon dodged a bullet. With that look? She&#39;s practically advertising herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take the man away and she&#39;s got nothing left.Just another gold-digger trying to act like she&#39;s someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices scratched against Brendon&#39;s patience like nails on glass. He/d had enough.&#34;Cut it out!&#34; he snapped, his tone sharper than they&#39;d heard all night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting fora reply, Brendon gave them one final glare and stormed off in Christina&#39;s direction.</p>
