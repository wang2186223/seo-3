                <p>Christina passed her phone to the female officer without a word and then backed away, her face stricken with a convincing act of fear so raw that it could&#39;ve fooled anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie didn&#39;t react at first. She stood still,breathing heavily. But as the reality of the situation hit her, fury bubbled up and she lunged forward. Yet, restrained by the officer,she couldn&#39;t get any closer to Christina.Her hands clenched into fists. Then, she lifted her foot and kicked in Christina&#39;s direction, not caring who saw. &#34;You conniving witch! You tricked us! Stop pretending!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie belatedly realized she had been outsmarted by Christina. All that boldness Christina flaunted earlier had vanished. Now,Christina looked like some fragile victim, eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lowered, shoulders shaking-completely transformed, hoping people would pity her. It was disgusting. The gall of this woman. Faking it all like she deserved an Oscar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Katie didn&#39;t see was the effect her outburst had on the watching officers. Every shout. Every wild movement. It just made Christina seem more like the wounded one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, Christina had proof. Real, solid evidence. She hadn&#39;t started the mess-Katie and the others had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the officers finished their investigation, they handed down fines and a strict verbal warning to everyone involved.Finnegan was detained for a few days as punishment for filing false police reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except for Finnegan, the rest of the group was released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside the police station, Yolanda broke down and ran into Brendon&#39;s arms, sobbing like her chest might cave in. &#34;Brendon, what do we</p>
                
                
                
                <p>do now? My dad didn&#39;t mean for this to happen...&#34; Her voice cracked, full of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila stood off to the side, face pale. &#34;It was just a harmless lie,&#34; she said quietly. &#34;Did the officers really need to take it that far? Locking Finnegan up over that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina&#39;s the reason we got hit with those fines! If she hadn&#39;t pulled that stunt, we wouldn&#39;t have been in this mess!&#34; Katie snapped, her voice shaking with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn crossed her arms and sneered, &#34;Lucky thing our Dawson family had the sense to cut her off when we did. That bitch&#39;s cursed-she would&#39;ve dragged all of us down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda sniffled, seizing the moment to make her appear gentle and understanding. &#34;It&#39;s not all on Christina. She was just looking out for herself... She had her reasons. But my dad...&#34;Her words gave way to sobs before she could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon glanced at Yolanda, taking in the tears</p>
                
                
                
                <p>trailing down her face. But it wasn&#39;t her he saw.Instead, his mind wandered back to Christina&#39;s tearful image. He wasn&#39;t even sure if it was Yolanda or Christina that his chest tightened for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll find a way to get your father out,&#34; Brendon said to Yolanda, his voice steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really?&#34; Yolanda blinked up at him, her eyes red and swollen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.&#34; Brendon reached out and brushed her tears away with his thumb. &#34;Come on. Let&#39;s head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But even while the words left his mouth, he wasn&#39;t fully present. That look on Christina&#39;s face-so raw, so shaken-it wouldn&#39;t leave him.Christina had always struck him as tough. The kind of woman who didn&#39;t crumble. But today,she did. And it wasn&#39;t an act. She must have been genuinely terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the group continued their chatter,Brendon stayed silent. Every step he took was haunted by that moment-Christina&#39;s trembling,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tear-filled eyes burned into his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Katie&#39;s voice rang out, slicing through Brendon&#39;s drifting thoughts like a slap to the face.&#34;Stop right there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shout rang loud and fierce, but Christina didn&#39;t even flinch. She kept walking, completely unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by a surge of anger, Katie charged ahead and threw herself in front of Christina, cutting off her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina frowned, her gaze sharp and unyielding. &#34;Haven&#39;t you learned your lesson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking with fury, Katie stood her ground.Her expression clouded over, and her hands clenched at her sides. &#34;You think you can take us on? Without backup, you&#39;re nobody!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step aside,&#34; Christina commanded with a chilling calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You&#39;re going back to the police station,and you&#39;re going to make sure they let</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s dad out. Right now,&#34; Katie demanded,lifting her chin defiantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That man means nothing to me. Why would I bother getting involved? If you&#39;re really that worried about him, maybe you should go sit in that cell for him,&#34; Christina retorted. She folded her arms and stared at Katie like she was a complete fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething,Sheila stomped forward and jabbed a finger at Christina. &#34;You&#39;re such a scheming bitch! You fooled everyone at the police station,crying like you were really terrified. Your audacity and shamelessness astounded me!&#34;</p>
