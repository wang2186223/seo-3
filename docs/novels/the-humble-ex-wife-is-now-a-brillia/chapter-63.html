                <p>Overconfidence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda leaned in, her voice sharp with anticipation. &#34;So, what&#39;s your plan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked smile curled across Katie&#39;s lips. &#34;Easy.We drug Christina, stage a few scandalous photos with some random scumbag, and then shove the evidence in her face until she signs everything away in the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfaction radiated from Katie-she looked downright gleeful at her own cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noting Brendon&#39;s jaw tightened, his eyes turning stormy,Yolanda hurried to play the voice of reason,clutching Katie&#39;s arm, her voice tinged with fake caution. &#34;Katie, that&#39;s going too far.We can&#39;t just frame Christina for something she didn&#39;t do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie clenched her jaw and hissed the words in a low, seething tone, &#34;Why not? She&#39;s just a shameless slut. She acts like a whore and dared betrayed my brother. I&#39;ll make her wish she&#39;d never been born!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon shot Katie with a cutting glare. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Stay out of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie bristled, refusing to back down. &#34;Why are you always so quick to defend her? What kind of witchcraft did she use on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie spat out her next words, her anger simmering, &#34;She&#39;s cuckolded you, and you just stand there and take it? Even if you can stomach it, don&#39;t you at least think about Yolanda? Why should that despicable bitch get the house and the money? All of it should go to Yolanda! She&#39;s about to marry you. She&#39;s the future lady of this family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking her glee, Yolanda intervened with a gentle sigh, lowering her gaze as if resigned &#34;Katie, don&#39;t say things like that... Christina still deserves some kind of compensation. Even if l have to suffer a little, I&#39;m willing. I trust your brother to do what&#39;s fair. He would never let me lose out in the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s frustration simmered in her glare.&#34;Yolanda, you&#39;re way too soft. If you keep this up, that bitch will trample all over you one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Yolanda&#39;s head drooped, her voice barely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>audible. &#34;I just... I believe in your brother. He&#39;ll keep me safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s voice cut through the tension, cold and absolute. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Whatever&#39;s between me and Christina is my business. None of you are to meddle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car rolled to a stop, Brendon shot Katie a look sharp enough to make her flinch.&#34;And if you dare go through with that filthy little scheme, don&#39;t think I&#39;ll let it slide just because you&#39;re my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s hands balled into fists as she pressed.&#34;Just be honest-do you still have feelings for Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Brendon bristled, his tone sharp and his features clouded with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Katie could challenge him, he yanked the door open and strode out. &#34;We&#39;re done here.&#34;He left the two women in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie glowered after him, chest heaving with fury. When she finally turned, she found Yolanda biting her lip, tears gathering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yolanda...&#34; Katie&#39;s words carried a soft wave of empathy. &#34;Don&#39;t let it get to you, alright?There&#39;s no way my brother still has feelings for that tramp. She&#39;s out there sleeping around-who&#39;d want disgusting leftovers like her?Brendon could have anyone in the world.Why would he ever settle for that slut?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, trembling sniff escaped Yolanda.The acting skills she showcased were impressive enough to earn her an Academy Award for Best Actress. &#34;I know... I do trust him. It&#39;s just... It&#39;s a bit hard not to feel hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie reached over, her eyes full of steely promise. &#34;Don&#39;t fret. You&#39;re the only sister-in-law I&#39;ll ever acknowledge. That&#39;s never changing.I&#39;ve got your back, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda met her gaze, measured gratitude shining through the sheen of tears. &#34;Thank you,Katie.I mean it-I&#39;ll never forget your kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of this. Let&#39;s go find your parents.Your dad said he&#39;s cooked up a plan for dealing with that bitch.&#34; With an exasperated huff, Katie yanked the car door open and strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Brendon was already striding</p>
                
                
                
                <p>across the courtyard, his expression stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moving truck sat squarely in the driveway,its engine still idling as a crew of burly men lugged boxes into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood at the center of the chaos,calmly directing the movers with crisp, decisive gestures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon stalked up to her, eyes narrowed with suspicion. &#34;Drop the act, Christina. Why don&#39;t you just admit it?&#34; he demanded, his voice sharp as broken glass. &#34;This place is just a rented prop -part of your little charade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then seized her shoulders, compelling her to meet his gaze. &#34;Where are the staff? If this is really your house, why is there no one around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cocky grin flickered across his face, as if he&#39;d just exposed her greatest secret.</p>
