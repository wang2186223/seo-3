                <p>Yolanda&#39;s red-rimmed eyes and trembling voice were enough to tighten Brendon&#39;s heart. To him,she embodied everything virtuous-selfless,nurturing, and impossibly kind-qualities that Christina never once showed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s thumb traced slow circles across the back of Yolanda&#39;s hand, cherishing the delicate warmth of her skin. &#34;You&#39;ll know by then,&#34; he murmured, pulling her into a firm embrace.&#34;Yolanda, nothing will ever happen to you as long as I&#39;m here.&#34; 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touched by his words, Yolanda buried her face in his chest, her whisper unsteady as if she truly regretted her abrupt leave back then. &#34;Brendon,I&#39;ll never leave your side or break your heart again. I&#39;m sorry for leaving you three years ago.It was my grandfather... He threatened me with his life. I had no choice but to leave the country back then. Brendon. I didn&#39;t know what else to do...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda added,tears glimmering in her eyes, a calculated act of innocence, &#34;But-tell me the truth...Have you truly forgiven me? Or is this just about hurting Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon froze at the question, the image of Christina&#39;s cold, dismissive face flashing in his mind,the humiliation still clinging to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened. &#34;She isn&#39;t worth that kind of effort,&#34; he said, voice sharp with disdain.&#34;I know you were trapped, Yolanda. I&#39;ve never blamed you-not for a second. From now on,nothing will come between us again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s heart swelled at the vehemence in his voice. His loathing for Christina felt like a gift.So, Christina truly had no charm at all. Despite her years of efforts to win Brendon&#39;s affection,she could not earn a sliver of his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda smirked, drawing pleasure from the conclusion that Christina held less charm than her. Despite the time and distance, all she had to do was return, let a single tear/fall, brush her hand against Brendon&#39;s-and he was hers again,completely. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie sneered, her tone dripping with disdain,&#34;Yolanda, someone like Christina doesn&#39;t even deserve to breathe the same air as you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on an air of gentle modesty, Yolanda gave Katie a slight frown. &#34;Katie, let&#39;s not speak ill of her. While I was away, she did stay by Brendon&#39;s side to care for him. For that, I&#39;m thankful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flickered across Katie&#39;s face as she retorted, &#34;Yolanda! You&#39;re way too kind,too forgiving. Keep acting like this, and one day someone might snatch Brendon right out from under you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s never going to happen,&#34; Brendon interjected, his brows furrowing. &#34;I belong to Yolanda. That won&#39;t change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brendon, you&#39;re really telling me you never felt anything for Christina? Not even a little?&#34;Katie asked, raising an eyebrow. Her/intuition told her that there was something subtly different in the way he looked at Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing at all,&#34; Brendon said, his tone sharp and certain. &#34;Christina means nothing to me and never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his gaze to Yolanda, his eyes softened with affection. &#34;There&#39;s only one woman l&#39;ve ever loved-and she&#39;s right here in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion overcame Yolanda, and she clung to him tightly, tears spilling as she whispered, &#34;Brendon...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, watching the tender moment unfold,exhaled slowly, a sense of reassurance washing over her. Maybe she&#39;d misread things. Their connection was unshakable-no outsider could ever come between them. She had always viewed Brendon and Yolanda&#39;s love as something rare, like it belonged in storybooks.Christina could plot all she wanted,but it would never change a thing. Brendon&#39;s heart would never belong to her, and there wasn&#39;t a chance she could ever steal him from Yolanda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the brief silence, Katie asked brightly,&#34;Should we head to the Morfort Restaurantnow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon didn&#39;t mniss a beat. He remembered Christina had been there, and with no sign of hesitation, he said, &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the three of them reached Morfort Restaurant. But by the time they got there,they&#39;d already missed the better seating, and Brendon&#39;s ranking in the competition wasn&#39;t quite enough to secure a prime spot. So, they ended up at a table farther off, while Christina sat up front at the first table.</p>
