                <p>Christina brushed it off with an easy smile.&#34;Honestly, there&#39;s nothing to be sorry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lull settled over the car before Dylan spoke up out of the blue. &#34;I&#39;ll give the driver an extra month&#39;s bonus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Christina off guard. &#34;Wait, what brought that on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mentioned earlier that his quick thinking and skill behind the wheel impressed you,&#34;Dylan explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brow furrowed as she tried to catch up.&#34;Right.That&#39;s true, I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, he deserves a reward then,&#34; Dylan said,his tone completely staightforward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped out of Christina. &#34;I don&#39;t really understand your rules. If you say he deserves it,then who am I to argue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Dylan replied without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, overcome with gratitude, blurted out, &#34;Thank you so much, Miss Jones. Thank you,Mr.Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver was genuinely surprised. Instead of getting in trouble, he&#39;d wound up with an unexpected bonus. From the rearview mirror,he shot Christina a grateful look, silent thanks shining in his eyes. He was certain he owed everything to her kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan made a sudden decision. &#34;He&#39;ll be your personal driver from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious?&#34; Christina&#39;s jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Dylan replied, &#34;I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;re always hailing cabs. Having a personal driver would spare you the hassle.There&#39;s no need for you to worry about the car or the costs-I&#39;ll handle the driver&#39;s salary and everything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;I appreciate it, but it&#39;s really unnecessary. I can manage to buy a car on my own. Plus, your fleet is a bit too flashy for my taste-l&#39;d rather not draw attention everywhere I go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan all along was to buy something simple,nothing more than what she needed to get around-certainly not a showy ride. Meanwhile,every car in Dylan&#39;s collection was the kind that turned heads, high-end models with jaw-dropping price tags, a few even custom-built for him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;s the issue, I&#39;ll just purchase something more understated,&#34; Dylan suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Driving myself is what I&#39;m comfortable with.&#34;Christina gave a gentle sigh. It didn&#39;t sit right with her to keep accepting favors. Staying in Dylan&#39;s villa was generous enough. Taking a car and a driver felt like too big a leap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think of the driver as a thank-you for looking after Chloe.&#34; Dylan&#39;s tone softened just a touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Christina waver, Dylan added, &#34;Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve had a glass of wine or you&#39;re just too exhausted to drive-just call him. No need to worry about pay or benefits. I&#39;ll take care of everything. And he&#39;s getting an extra six months&#39; bonus for his trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, who&#39;d been listening intently, nearly let his foot slip from the pedal at the mention</p>
                
                
                
                <p>of such a hefty bonus. Even with his heart racing,he managed to bring the car to a smooth stop outside the villa. He kept quiet,not wanting to interrupt, but his eyes found Christina&#39;s in the mirror, full of silent pleading and hope. A yes from her would mean the world to him. He&#39;d treat the job with even more loyalty if she accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the weight of his anticipation, Christina finally relented. A nod sealed it. &#34;Alright then.Thank you, Mr. Scott.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time that day, something gentle had flickered in Dylan&#39;s expression, the hint of a smile breaking through his usual reserve. Any trace of weariness vanished from his face,replaced by a quiet contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, Miss Jones!&#34; the driver blurted out, unable to contain his joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle smile lingered on Christina&#39;s lips.Dylan&#39;s voice followed, calm and steady. &#34;Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow, he&#39;ll be waiting for your instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina answered with a simple, &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside the car, she lingered by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her eyes following the car until it vanished from sight. Only then did she head back into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawn brought a new day. Christina padded out of her room, still in pajamas. Shuffling downstairs and stifling a yawn, she blinked away sleep, her eyes scanning the living room. What she saw made her come to a sudden halt,completely taken aback.</p>
