                <p>Unconsciously, Chloe tightened her grip on Christina&#39;s hand, her fear quietly showing through. She was terrified of becoming a burden to others. Before, when she had been merely plagued by illness, she could manage by herself. But now, blinded by sudden darkness,so many things felt unreachable, and she had no choice but to ask for help. If she had been blind from birth, she might have learned to live independently by now. But losing her sight so abruptly left her anxious and scared-worried she wouldn&#39;t be able to adjust or learn new ways to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being plunged into a world of darkness with nothing but her hands to guide her was terrifying. The panic came in waves, and the unknown always seemed to be waiting just out of reach, cloaked in shadows. She wanted to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>stay strong. She really did. But no matter how hard she tried, her fear of the endless blackness slipped through her carefully built courage</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe hated the thought of troubling anyone. If the servants stayed on, she wouldn&#39;t have to bother Christina, and it would help keep the staff employed,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the pressure of Chloe&#39;s tightening grip,Christina looked at her with deep compassion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Christina said softly. &#34;We&#39;ll keep the servants. I&#39;ll take care of their wages and benefits.&#34; She understood all too well the pain of someone who had once seen the light but was now trapped in darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan quickly shook his head. &#34;No, you don&#39;t have to worry about that. You&#39;ve done so much for the Scott family already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe gave a small smile. &#34;If you&#39;re feeling awkward, Christina, then how about this? Once l start seeing a little again, could you go on a trip with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina caressed Chloe&#39;s hand reassuringly.&#34;Sure,&#34; she said without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Christina and Dylan understood what Chloe was really hoping for, no one spoke it aloud. Chloe simply feared she didn&#39;t have much time left and longed to see the world&#39;s beauty while she still could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shifting the gear, Dylan gazed at Christina and asked, &#34;Are you thinking about getting a job?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shook her head &#34;Not yet. Maybe later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just gone through a divorce and needed time to rest, with no plans to work immediately. Besides, she had enough money to live comfortably. Even if she never worked again, she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the basic necessities. If worse came to worst,selling the sports car she&#39;d won in shooting contests would keep her afloat for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you help look after Chloe?&#34; Dylan suggested. &#34;The servants can manage her daily</p>
                
                
                
                <p>needs.You just keep her company. I&#39;ll pay you a hundred thousand a month plus a bonus at the end of the year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most people, Dylan&#39;s offer would have felt like a golden opportunity-a dream job handed to them on a silver platter. But Christina, who was already financially independent, didn&#39;t feel particularly tempted However, she genuinely enjoyed Chloe&#39;s bright and cheerful spirit. That alone was enough reason to say yes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mind,&#34; Christina said with a raised eyebrow and a smile, &#34;but are you really sure you want to pay a hundred thousand a month just for me to keep her company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan smiled warmly. &#34;Yes. Knowing you&#39;re there puts my mind at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina laughed softly. &#34;Well, with a deal like that,how can I refuse? Who doesn&#39;t like easy money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s fantastic!&#34; Chloe exclaimed, her excitement bubbling over. &#34;Now I get to stick to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you,Christina!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Chloe not lost her vision, she would&#39;ve been bouncing on the hospital bed, too thrilled to sit still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like I&#39;m officially Miss Scott&#39;s personal caregiver now,&#34; Christina said with a playful grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe pretended to be offended, turning her head with a mock frown. &#34;Caregiver? Say that again, and I might just stop talking to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be mad,&#34; Christina said with a grin. &#34;We&#39;ll just call it that in public to keep the gossip at bay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chloe pouted. &#34;I don&#39;t care about gossip, but if you do, Christina, I&#39;ll listen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s my good girl,&#34; Christina said, gently patting her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them get along so well, Dylan let out a relieved sigh. He gave Chloe a gentle warning not to upset Christina or else he&#39;d send her back to the Scott estate in Lorbridge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frightened, Chloe immediately clung to Christina&#39;s arm and promised over and over that she would never upset Christina and would always listen to her.</p>
