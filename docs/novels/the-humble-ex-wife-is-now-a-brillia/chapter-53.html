                <p>The house rang with Finnegan&#39;s terrified screams, mixed with the panicked shrieks of the others as they scrambled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina finally stopped, arms crossed and breath steady. &#34;Medicine delivered, illness cured.Time to pay up-I don&#39;t do credit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group froze, panting, their eyes wide with fear. They stared at her like she might snap at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What money?&#34; Finnegan gasped, still out of breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina raised a brow. &#34;The five-million bet remember? What, you trying to weasel out of it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie, still catching her breath, glared. &#34;Did you even cure Finnegan? If anything, you owe us-for emotional damage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I cured him alright,&#34; Christina said,pointing at Finnegan. &#34;Look at him. He&#39;s wide awake and sprinting like an Olympian. I didn&#39;t just bring him back-I upgraded him. Guys half his</p>
                
                
                
                <p>age can&#39;t keep up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nonsense!&#34;, Sheila snapped, face flushed with anger. She looked like she wanted to lunge-if not for the fear still hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, I did my part. You lost and owed me money,&#34; Christina said coolly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan let out a sharp laugh. &#34;And if we don&#39;t pay? What&#39;re you gonna do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah!&#34; Katie chimed in, smirking. &#34;What can you possibly do,you psycho?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina...&#34; Yolanda said softly, once again managing to paint Christina as a villain. &#34;Please be reasonable. You can&#39;t just shake people down like this. It&#39;s not right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina rolled her eyes. &#34;If I weren&#39;t reasonable,you&#39;d all be buried out back by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out a tablet and played a video,holding it out for them to see. &#34;Here&#39;s proof. The bet, the win, the miracle cure-all caught on camera. Try stiffing me. I&#39;ll post this online and let the world decide.&#34; Her voice was steady, each word sharp and sure. Not a hint of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group paled as they watched the footage.The audio was crystal clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, Finnegan snatched the tablet from Christina&#39;s hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief swept through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha!&#34; Finnegan shouted. &#34;No proof now, genius!Good luck getting a dime out of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed. &#34;What&#39;ll you post now? Your imaginary win?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t even blink. &#34;Smash that tablet all you want. My security system auto-uploads everything-multiple backups.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned, locking eyes with Finnegan just as he reached for the security camera overhead,ready to destroy it. She drawled, &#34;And by the way -trying to destroy that camera? That&#39;s just more evidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her fingers like a gun and aimed at him with a smirk. &#34;You&#39;re in deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Sheila crept up behind Christina,gripping a glass, her eyes burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina&#39;s senses were razor-sharp. Her hearing, especially, was deadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Sheila raised the glass, Christina sidestepped and spun, gripping Sheila&#39;s wrist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila cried out in pain, &#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glass slipped from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina caught the glass just before it hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; Yolanda shouted,lunging forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Christina&#39;s glare froze Yolanda in place.Her grip tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Sheila cried again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, please,&#34; Yolanda pleaded, eyes red.&#34;Let her go. She didn&#39;t mean any harm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave a cold laugh. &#34;No harm? If this glass had hit me, l&#39;d be bleeding-or dead.You call that harmless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina raised an eyebrow. &#34;Tell you what-why don&#39;t I try the same thing on you, and you tell me how it feels?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yolanda, stop begging her!&#34; Katie barked. &#34;We didn&#39;t do anything wrong! This is my brother&#39;s house-we can throw her out if we want!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice turned ice-cold. &#34;This house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Part of my divorce settlement. It belongs to me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>now,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Says who?&#34; a voice cut in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned. Her eyes narrowed. It was Brendon. He stood there, face hard, a bandage on his head, and a storm brewing behind his eyes.She frowned slightly.He was hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You promised me this house. It&#39;s in the agreement,&#34; Christina said calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The agreement says a seaside property. Not this one.And since the papers aren&#39;t finalized, it&#39;s still mine,&#34; Brendon replied coldly. He could still feel the sting-Christina ignoring his calls, climbing into that luxury car without a word of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you said this one was mine,&#34; Christina said,looking into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verbal promises don&#39;t count. I&#39;ve changed my mind. It&#39;s Yolanda&#39;s now,&#34; Brendon said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stared at him for a long moment.&#34;Brendon... Going back on your word-What kind of man does that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your approval to be a man. You think too highly of yourself, Christina,&#34; Brendon sneered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina stood there, stunned, eyes flicking to the others. Their faces were full of smug delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so clever, right? With all those men you&#39;ve been charming, I&#39;m sure one of them can buy you a fancy new house,&#34; Brendon added with a smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina said nothing. She had long stopped expecting anything from him. But his words stil cut deep. Every cruel syllable jabbed like a needle, turning her past sacrifices into one long,bitter joke.</p>
