                <p>Christina sat in the corner, still as stone, her eyes locked on the bloodied bodies scattered across the floor.Damn... Dylan wasn&#39;t one to waste time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan caught her dazed look and traced her line of sight. The carnage wasn&#39;t subtle-twisted limbs, lifeless faces, blood pooling beneath them like ink spilled from a shattered bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mistook her stillness for fear, and something unfamiliar twisted in his chest-sympathy and maybe even regret for letting her witness such a scene. His brow creased. Quietly, he crouched beside her. Without a word, his calloused palm moved to gently cover her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be afraid...&#34; The edge in his voice was gone, replaced by something softer. &#34;I&#39;m here.You&#39;re safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With delicate insistence, he turned her face away from the bodies, guiding her gaze to him,shielding her from the worst of it. &#34;Don&#39;t look,&#34; he whispered. &#34;Just thinkof it like a bad dream, one you&#39;ll wake up from soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes-dark,burning, unwavering-held hers in a quiet command, pulling her back from the brink.The usual frost in his eyes had thawed-scorched away by something unseen-leaving behind an unfamiliar warmth. Something almost gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited, unmoving, until Christina gave a soft,shaky &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he allow himself a silent breath-one he hadn&#39;t realized he was holding. She was still fighting. That was a good sign. He tucked the thought away like a mission directive: Therapist.Tomorrow. No exceptions. Unaddressed,trauma wasn&#39;t a wound-it was a ticking time bomb.It crept in as nightmares turning shadows into monsters. This wasn&#39;t a fender bender or some close call. Christina had walked through hell&#39;s front door and barely made it back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened as he reached for the ropes,fingers steady but his mind storming. Then, he saw them. The deep, angry ridges across her wrists and ankles-skin rubbed raw, welts etched like curses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something inside him detonated. His eyes went dark, a dangerous shift rolling through him like thunder before a downpour. The Terrell family.They didn&#39;t deserve mercy. They didn&#39;t even</p>
                
                
                
                <p>deserve fear. They deserved to die miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does it hurt?&#34; His voice came out low-rough like gravel, but carrying a strange softness underneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina shook her head.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accepted his help, but as soon as her feet touched the floor, her knees betrayed her. Her legs folded, weak and trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan caught her in a flash-arms steel-tight around her, instincts faster than thought. For the first time, his iron composure had cracked. A flicker of flush-real and raw-flashed across his face like lightning slashing through stormclouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They froze. Her chest close to his, eyes locked,breath tangled in the sudden quiet. The air between them shifted, thick with an unspoken pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed before reality reassembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m fine,&#34; Christina blurted, trying to wriggle free. But then her knee brushed a scrape, and the pain hit sharply. She hissed softly, breath catching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dylan didn&#39;t let go. His gaze dropped to her swollen ankle. His frown deepened into</p>
                
                
                
                <p>something lethal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me.&#34; Without waiting, he slid one arm beneath her knees and lifted her effortlessly into his arms. Reflex kicked in-her arms snapped around his neck, her cheeks flushing with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, I&#39;m fine-it&#39;s just a scratch! You&#39;re overreacting,&#34; she muttered, flustered. To her,these minor scrapes barely registered-they weren&#39;t worth a bandage, let alone anyone fussing over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A scratch is still an injury. I&#39;m not overreacting,&#34;Dylan said, his voice steady and unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something fragile and unfamiliar stirred in Christina&#39;s chest. Her grip on his shoulder tightened, as if holding on might keep the feeling from slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once given everything she had to the Dawson family. To Brendon. Time, devotion,love -poured out like water into a cracked vessel that never held a drop. And what did she get in return?Not even the ghost of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could still recall that day in the kitchen-how the knife had slipped, the sharp sting followed by a rush of blood spilling across her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon had shot her a cold, indifferent glance,instructed a servant to fetch the first-aid kit, and walked off without a backward look. Not once did he ask how she was-not in that moment, not ever. It was almost cruel, the contrast. Even a stranger might&#39;ve asked if she was okay. But Brendon, her husband at that time, hadn&#39;t even blinked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, she&#39;d seen the way Brendon looked at Yolanda. Gentle hands brushing hair from her face. Soft words dipped in honey. He was capable of warmth-just not for her. Maybe that was the simple difference-love cared, indifference didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull ache bloomed in Christina&#39;s chest.She had loved fiercely.Given without keeping score. And in the end, she hadn&#39;t even been worth a moment of kindness.</p>
