                <p>Christina&#39;s voice dripped with icy sarcasm. Her tone alone made everyone&#39;s blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie practically vibrated with rage. &#34;Enough with that attitude! Apologize properly, pay for the medical bills, and maybe-maybe-we&#39;ll let this go.If not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina tilted her head, her smile cool and effortless. &#34;If not,what? You&#39;ll cry louder?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s eyes blazed. &#34;We&#39;ll press charges! You&#39;ll be arrested for assault. Hope you enjoy jail food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina widened her eyes in mock fear, clasping her hands to her chest. &#34;Oh no, not that.Please don&#39;t call the police... I might be able to heal that old man myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie scoffed, her tone cutting.&#34;Heal Finnegan?You? Don&#39;t make me laugh-you&#39;re not even a real doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Yolanda&#39;s voice wavered, choked with theatrical tears. &#34;Christina, how can you stil refuse to acknowledge your misdeeds? If you&#39;re angry, take it out on me-not on my father. He&#39;s</p>
                
                
                
                <p>not in the best health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not in the best health?&#34; Christina&#39;s smile was razor-sharp. &#34;Perfect. Not only can I heal him-I&#39;ll have him doing cartwheels by next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina!&#34; Yolanda&#39;s voice cracked as if it were a plea, her eyes shimmering with fake tears. &#34;How can you joke like this? Have you no heart at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you really heal Finnegan? And make him fit as a fiddle?&#34; Katie folded her arms, practically salivating at the chance to spring her trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Christina replied, her voice cool and unwavering, laced with an infuriating calm that only made Katie itch to humiliate her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good!&#34; Katie leaned forward, eyes gleaming with anticipation. &#34;Let&#39;s make it interesting. If you pull it off, I&#39;ll give you five million. If not-you owe me five million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie couldn&#39;t believe how easily Christina had walked into her trap. What an idiot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Deal.&#34; Christina&#39;s answer came without hesitation, her confidence unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sheila, who had remained quiet until now, chimed in with a smile that didn&#39;t reach her eyes,&#34;Why don&#39;t we all get in on this? We&#39;ll eaach put up one</p>
                
                
                
                <p>million. If you fail, you owe each of us a million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie hesitated, lips pursed-but with everyone watching, backing down wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finnegan lay perfectly still, struggling to suppress a grin. With his feigning to be seriously wounded on the floor, his family would win three million? It felt like the heavens themselves had wired him a personal jackpot. He wasn&#39;t just after the three million-he also planned to squeeze every last penny from Christina for &#34;medical expenses.&#34; If he played this right, she&#39;d be paying for everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, excuse me for a moment.&#34; Christina turned on her heel and disappeared into the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she returned, gasps rippled through the room. She was holding a massive syringe-thick,gleaming, and absurdly oversized. It looked like it belonged in a veterinary clinic for sedating lions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What... What is that?&#34; Sheila&#39;s voice trembled,recoiling instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda blinked, stunned. &#34;Christina, you&#39;re not seriously going to use that on my dad,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34; Katie barked, eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bulging as she took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn&#39;s jaw dropped. &#34;You... You&#39;re not going to kill him, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kill him?&#34; Christina scoffed, a mischievous glint in her eye. &#34;Please. I&#39;m saving his life.&#34; She held the syringe aloft like it was a magic wand. &#34;Relax.I have plenty of experience with this sort of thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Experience?&#34; Yolanda echoed skeptically. &#34;Since when have you ever studied medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t,&#34; Christina answered cheerfully. &#34;But I am a vet, so that&#39;s close enough. Besides, don&#39;t be dramatic. A body&#39;s a body. One shot from this,and he&#39;ll be doing jumping jacks before lunch.&#34;</p>
