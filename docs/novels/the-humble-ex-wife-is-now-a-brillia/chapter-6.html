                <p>As the white mask was torn away, Christina&#39;s breathtaking face was revealed. Graceful features framed her face-so striking that it was impossible not to stare. The contradictory qualities of allure and innocence coexisted on her face without the slightest discord, blending seamlessly into a unique charm that no one could replicate. She exuded an enchanting glow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina?&#34; Brendon stood rooted to the spot,his brain struggling to process this unexpected revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s jaw dropped as her eyes locked on Christina,disbelief washing over her like a slap.The idea that Christina-of all people-had just won the shooting match felt absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Katie nor Brendon could reconcile with the fact that the woman who once folded laundry and made grocery lists had just emerged victorious in the shooting competition. How could a woman, cast aside and overlooked for the past three years, pull off breathtakingly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>difficult blind shots with that kind of precision and grace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally finding her voice, Katie scowled and stepped forward. &#34;What the hell are you doing here,Christina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t flinch. Her smile was razor-sharp,her expression unreadable. &#34;I could ask you the same thing. And why wouldn&#39;t I be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon retorted, his voice sharp and loud,&#34;This isn&#39;t a place for someone like you. You&#39;re not cut out for this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Christina cocked her head, her smile now dripping with mockery. &#34;Where I choose to be is none of your concern. And since when do pathetic people like you get to decide what I&#39;m allowed to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitch!&#34; Katie, burning with fury, lunged forward with her hand raised, ready to strike Christina across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even blinking, Christina caught Katie&#39;s wrist mid-air. Her grip was steady. Unflinching.Cold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie gasped as pressure clamped down on her bones. &#34;Ah!&#34; she cried out, her voice cracking in pain. She was mildly surprised. That grip wasn&#39;t normal. That strength didn&#39;t belong to the fragile woman they thought they knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina Jones!&#34; Brendon charged forward, his face dark with fury as he seized Christina&#39;s wrist.&#34;Let go of Katie. Now,&#34; he said through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments like this had played out before countless times. Every time things got ugly between Christina and his family, Brendon chose his blood over her without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina gave him a sharp look and a mocking smile before her fingers loosened. Katie stumbled back, cradling her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t release Katie because of Brendon. The truth was, she had no desire to engage with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after Christina let go, Brendon refused to release her. His grip stayed firm, as if trying to stake some last claim. &#34;Let go of me,&#34; Christina said, her voice low and sharp, her patience thinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sell me the King&#39;s treatment opportunity. I&#39;ll pay whatever it takes&#34; Instead of backing off,Brendon tightened his hold</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina met his gaze with a sneer, her eyes brimming with contempt. &#34;Anything lask for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything,&#34; Brendon said without hesitation &#34;Just don&#39;t ask for my heart or the position of my wife</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Brendon&#39;s mind, Christina was shallow enough to jump at the right offer Money, he assumed,was all it would take He saw no difference between his offer and the choice she&#39;d made when she supposedly hit the bar for a sugar daddy the other night</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s eyes locked onto his. They were sharp. Unforgiving. &#34;Then give me your life in return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The demand hit him hard. His expression darkened, and for a moment, he was completely thrown. His life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t push it, Christina Jones!&#34; Katie snapped,her voice shrill with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yolanda&#39;s brows pulled together as she spoke up, her voice weak, much like most expected</p>
                
                
                
                <p>from a patient. &#34;Christina, I know you can&#39;t stand me since Brendon chose me over you and never loved you If you&#39;re angry, aim it at me Brendon doesn&#39;t deserve your bitterness All he ever wanted was to marry me, the woman he truly loves-is that so unforgivable? If you still want to be with him, I won&#39;t stand in your way I&#39;ll step back But if I do, Brendon will be heartbroken Can you really bear to see him live the rest of his life in pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina turned her gaze to Yolanda, noticing the shimmer of unshed tears clinging to the edges of her eyes. Yolanda&#39;s performance was hard to stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina had to admit Yolanda was a master of manipulative tricks, each word dripped with apparent concern for Brendon and blatant accusations of her being selfish and unreasonable, thus painting herself as an angel with a golden heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of light caught Christina&#39;s eye-Yolanda&#39;s necklace, a cruel reminder of her own past naivety. Back at the third anniversary of their marriage, she had believed that the necklace was a heartfeIt gesture from Brendon.She&#39;d deluded herself that maybe, just maybe,he had finally warmed up to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the truth hadn&#39;t just hurt It had wrecked her His harsh words-a gift specially prepared for Yolanda&#39;s return-had shattered the last illusion she clung to She&#39;d learned the hard way that love forced into existence only left scars behind.Some things, no matter how tightly held, simply weren&#39;t meant to be</p>
