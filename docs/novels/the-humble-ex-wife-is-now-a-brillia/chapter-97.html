                <p>Initially, Lauretta suspected Christina&#39;s hesitation stemmed from dissatisfaction with the sum offered, prompting her to consider a higher amount. But who would have guessed that Christina was asking for her help with something instead? Declining a generous five-million offer in exchange for help signaled that the favor Christina needed was no trivial matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta leaned back slightly, cautious. &#34;WVhat exactly do you want from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina noticed the wariness in Lauretta&#39;s voice and gave a calm smile. &#34;I need your help to uncover information about Woodfort. I&#39;m prepared to compensate you accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina recognized that Lauretta was no ordinary person. Lauretta&#39;s grandfather had once commanded troops, and her younger</p>
                
                
                
                <p>brother was already a major general. Their family wielded power that outshone even the most elite circles. With such a background,Lauretta had grown up sharp, observant, and always on alert. Naturally, she didn&#39;t trust easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta paused, caught off guard by how simple Christina&#39;s request was-just help digging up information on Woodfort. &#34;What do you need Woodfort for?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s expression turned serious. &#34;It&#39;s for Dylan&#39;s sister. She&#39;s being treated by Dr.King-the famous healer-but her treatment is missing one final ingredient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woodfort was derived from a rare plant notorious for its toxicity, yet its root possessed remarkable healing properties. Given the plant&#39;s scarcity and the difficulty involved in harvesting its root, obtaining it was an extraordinary challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean Chloe is sick?&#34; Lauretta asked, her tone changing. Having only just returned to the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>country, she hadn&#39;t been privy to this detait, A condition severe enough to warrant the King&#39;s attention must be grave indeed. But it surprised her that the Scott family had actually brought someone like King on board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Christina confirmed with a nod.&#34;That&#39;s why I need your help to find Woodfort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta hesitated, her expression troubled. &#34;lf this were a few years ago, I&#39;d have helped you in a heartbeat. But now...&#34; She gave a faint, bitter smile. &#34;I don&#39;t have those kinds of connections anymore. I left my family five years ago and moved overseas. I haven&#39;t spoken to any of them since. All I have now is money-not influence.I&#39;m really sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina looked slightly surprised but then nodded with understanding. &#34;That&#39;s alright. If you happen to come across anything, just let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well, I&#39;ll keep watch for you,&#34; Lauretta said gently, sliding the bank card toward Christina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should keep this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Christina could respond, Calvin&#39;s voice interrupted the moment. &#34;Lauretta, you should go back and visit your family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin sighed quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta&#39;s expression shifted. &#34;Mr. Emmett, can we not talk about that right now?&#34; she said,clearly uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin exhaled. &#34;I&#39;m only saying this because I&#39;m worried you&#39;ll regret it someday. Did you know your father is unwell? I intended to travel to Lorbridge to perform surgery on him, but chance led me to cross paths with you instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta&#39;s body stiffened, and her hand holding the fork visibly trembled. Slowly, she shifted her gaze to meet Calvin&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His condition isn&#39;t good,&#34; Calvin continued, his voice heavy. &#34;Honestly, I can&#39;t guarantee he&#39;ll even make it through the operation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t being dramatic-he truly wasn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>confident about the outcome. But if Christina got to perform the surgery, the chances would improve significantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauretta&#39;s fingers tightened around the fork.Her mind raced with memories of her father.A deep bitterness began to well up inside her. She felt like she&#39;d failed as a daughter. It had been years since she last contacted her family. Pride had built an invisible barrier, preventing her from reaching out. She had naively hoped that time alone might heal the fractures between them, but she had never considered the possibility of unforeseen circumstances. The mere thought of losing her father without one last farewell tightened a painful knot inside her heart,leaving her restless and unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Even you are not confident about the surgery?&#34;Lauretta asked, her eyes searching Calvin&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly shook his head. &#34;Yes. But if King did the surgery, there&#39;d be a better chance. Maybe an eighty percent success rate. Still not a</p>
                
                
                
                <p>guarantee-but much better odds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hope stirred within Lauretta. &#34;lf |help King acquire Woodfort, could I persuade King to undertake the case?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin cast a discreet glance at Christina. &#34;It&#39;s hard to say. King doesn&#39;t care about power or money. No one really knows what motivates King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calvin knew full well that Christina wouldn&#39;t be swayed under any circumstances, and her consent only came willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina, who had been quietly listening, finally spoke up. &#34;King will be in touch with me soon.How about I ask if King is on board?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? King will reach out to you?&#34; Lauretta&#39;s eyes sparkled with hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Christina nodded and then briefly &#34;explained&#34; how she had secured King&#39;s help for Chloe&#39;s treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| see,&#34; Lauretta said with a nod. &#34;I&#39;ll do</p>
                
                
                
                <p>everything I can to find Woodfort. If I succeed,I&#39;ll offer it in exchange for King to perform the surgery on my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina nodded thoughtfully. &#34;I&#39;ll make sure King hears your request.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Lauretta said sincerely, lifting her glass in a quiet toast of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Lauretta walked Christina out of Morfort Restaurant, the sky had darkened,and the evening air had cooled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle breeze brushed against Christina&#39;s face, tugging loose strands of her hair. Beneath the streetlamp&#39;s glow, her silhouette shimmered softly, her presence quietly commanding attention despite the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a sleek black Maybach rolled up to the curb. Christina assumed the driver had arrived and moved to greet him, but then a tall figure in a tailored black suit stepped out,radiating an air of effortless elegance. It was Dylan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina widened her eyes slightly. She had only called for the driver. What was Dylan doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly intoxicated from the wine, Christina smiled warmly as she closed the distance between them. &#34;You-&#34; Her words cut short as her high heel unexpectedly caught on the uneven pavement, sending her staggering forward in an unsteady falter.</p>
