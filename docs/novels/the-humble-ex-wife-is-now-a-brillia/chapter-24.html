                <p>The slap was a breath away from Christina&#39;s cheek, but in a flash, she pivoted, dodging cleanly. Her hand shot up, catching the attacker&#39;s wrist midair and wrenching it in one fluid,brutal motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Ouch,ouch, ouch!&#34; Joselyn Dawson,Katie and Brendon&#39;s mother, cried out, her face twisting in agony, pain etched deep into her furrowed brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom!&#34; Katie and Brendon shouted at once,panic lacing their voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, let go!&#34; Brendon barked, lunging in and yanking at her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie hurried to intervene, reaching to pry Christina&#39;s fingers away, but she didn&#39;t need to.Christina had already released her hold, cold and calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn cradled her wrist,stunned and trembling.Had no one stepped in, there was no doubt in her mind-Christina would&#39;ve broken it clean.Ruthless didn&#39;t even begin to cover it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disrespecting your elders is one thing,&#34; Joselyn snapped, her voice razor-sharp as her glare bore into Christina, &#34;but now you&#39;ve pushed Bethel into a hospital bed with your theatrics-what do you have to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joselyn&#39;s dislike for Christina ran deep. To her,this woman was unworthy of her son-no pedigree, no influence, no place in their world.If Bethel hadn&#39;t insisted on that godforsaken marriage, Christina would&#39;ve never gotten to marry into the Dawson family. Her son deserved better. Someone like Yolanda-refined, well-connected, useful. Not Christina, who was nothing but a liability, dead weight dragging him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no right to accuse me of anything,&#34;Christina replied, voice calm but cold, her chin lifting with unshakable defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That expression-it drove Joselyn mad. The arrogance. The nerve. The way this nobody stood there like she owned the room, like she belonged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No right?&#34; Joselyn hissed. &#34;Bethel is my mother-in-law! And you are the reason she&#39;s lying in that hospital bed! If she dies-I&#39;ll see to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it you rot in jail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver. &#34;All I did was break the news of the divorce. Your precious son is accountable. He argued with her and raised his voice,insisting that he marry Yolanda. He&#39;s the one who pushed Bethel over the edge. Not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina&#39;s voice cut like tempered steel. Yes,maybe she&#39;d played a role in Bethel&#39;s collapse -but Brendon lit the fuse. He&#39;d stoked the fire.Without him, Bethel might have been upset-but she wouldn&#39;t have collapsed in that chair,gasping and pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina wasn&#39;t about to lie-but she sure as hell wasn&#39;t taking the fall for all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Christina, you bear undeniable responsibility in this,&#34; Brendon said, his brow furrowed with exaggerated gravity. &#34;If you hadn&#39;t brought up the divorce, none of this would&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina let out a sharp, humorless laugh. &#34;Did you really think you could keep it a secret forever? Not everyone&#39;s as clueless as you seem to hope. And newsflash-the divorce is real.I have every right to speak the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie&#39;s voice exploded like a grenade. &#34;Grandma</p>
                
                
                
                <p>was perfectly fine until you showed up! The minute you stepped into that house, she ended up in a hospital bed. This is all on you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly!&#34; Joselyn snapped,her voice like venom.&#34;If anything happens to her, you&#39;ll pay dearly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon pounced, seizing the moment like a vulture. &#34;Christina, let&#39;s not make this harder than it is. You&#39;re not blameless, and you know it.Give up your treatment slot for my grandma,and we&#39;ll move forward-no grudges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never,&#34; Christina replied, her tone flat, final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brendon&#39;s frown deepened, twisting into disappointment. &#34;Christina, how could you be this heartless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie threw up her hands. &#34;See, Brendon? I told you she was vile! After everything our grandma did for her-this is how she repays her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trash. That&#39;s all she ever was!&#34; Joselyn snarled furiously. &#34;A gutter rat clinging to scraps of power she doesn&#39;t deserve. Bethel must&#39;ve gone mad,wasting all that affection on such a woman instead of her own blood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina remained stone-faced. &#34;I&#39;ll get Bethel</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a surgeon. If she has the operation and proper post-op care, she&#39;ll recover fully. That&#39;s what matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katie burst out laughing, cruel and shrill. &#34;You?Don&#39;t make me laugh! You couldn&#39;t even book an appointment with a half-decent doctor, let alone someone reputable. Just admit it-you want her dead. You&#39;d hand her off to a back-alley butcher and call it &#39;help&#39;. My grandma gave everything to you, and you repay her with betrayal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Christina didn&#39;t flinch. Her next words cut through the chaos like a blade. &#34;I&#39;m bringing in Dr. Calvin Emmett.&#34;</p>
