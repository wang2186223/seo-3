                <p>&#34;Perfect timing, Boss, Ms.Marsh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan wasn&#39;t shocked to see Jasper appearing with Evelina closely at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His immediate focus, however, was elsewhere. &#34;Ms. Marsh, what are your plans for this woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting quietly and almost unnoticed outside the operating room, Aurora felt a deep jolt of disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had accompanied Jasper to numerous high-profile events, dreaming endlessly of holding his arm-but he never permitted even a casual touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d sooner allow Florrie to cling affectionately than tolerate Aurora&#39;s slightest contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now,he showed no resistance to Evelina at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora had thoroughly investigated; Evelina and Cary might have signed divorce papers, but their separation wasn&#39;t officially finalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme,&#34; Evelina called out clearly. &#34;You haven&#39;t forgotten about our bet, haveyou?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her name, Esme visibly flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the entire four and a half hours of Florrie&#39;s operation, the Russell family&#39;s guards had confined Esme in an empty operating room. She had desperately sought an escape route, only to realize that neither Evelina nor the Russells would show her mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Elora started aggressively, only to falter under lan&#39;s sharp, warning stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her arrogance remained undiminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the reminder-I nearly forgot,&#34; she sneered. &#34;The agreement was clear. If Esme successfully performed the surgery, you&#39;d publicly admit your mistake and apologize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even stepped aside mockingly, creating a space before Esme. &#34;Now, apologize and make it quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, stay away from my son forever, or the consequences will be severe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian arrogantly gestured toward Evelina, adding, &#34;Hurry up and confess. My sister is forgiving-she might spare you further embarrassment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Cary quietly protested, saying, &#34;Evelina was wrong, but isn&#39;t a public apology too much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re divorced,&#34; Elora retorted fiercely. &#34;Why are you still defending her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She insisted, glaring hatefully at Evelina, &#34;The agreement explicitly called for a public apology. We&#39;ve even been kind enough to exclude media coverage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina smiled mockingly, her voice steady. &#34;If a public apology is what everyone desires, I&#39;ll gladly involve the media.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning a cold stare toward Esme, she added, &#34;Name a date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme frantically sought escape but found none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora stared skeptically, her voice rising. &#34;Evelina, are you insane? We&#39;re asking for your apology now-not later with media!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Elora completely, Evelina said firmly to Esme, &#34;Let&#39;s schedule it in half a month-after Florrie&#39;s recovery. I&#39;ll travel to lreah myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Landen Mitchell&#39;s grave rested on the southern outskirts of Ireah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please-no, l-I can&#39;t do it,&#34; Esme pleaded tearfully, pressing herself against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Cary&#39;s view had been partially obscured by Jasper&#39;s bodyguards. Only now did he notice Evelina being supported by that handsome young man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through him, and he shouted, &#34;Have you no shame? Always flaunting this man around! Look at Esme-she&#39;s still willing to spare you from humiliation. How could you ever compare?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina restrained Jasper, signaling subtly that this was her matter to handle personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme,&#34; Evelina said coldly. &#34;Have you clarified to everyone who really performed Miss Russell&#39;s surgery?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Addressed directly, Esme remained fearfully silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora seized the moment, gleefully saying, &#34;Speak up, Esme! Tell everyone loud and clear-it was your successful operation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina gave a nod, and the bodyguards activated a recording on the large screen, clearly displaying footage from the recent surgery. &#34;Watch carefully-recognize who&#39;s truly operating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina?It was you!&#34; Cary shouted in shocked recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A whirlwind of shock, shame, and humiliation overwhelmed him, exposing how deeply he&#39;d been deceived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora stubbornly replied, &#34;They all wore masks-it&#39;s impossible to identify clearly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina countered coldly, &#34;I also possess recordings from Cary&#39;s four vision-restoration surgeries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning directly to Cary, she responded coldly, &#34;By the way, payment for those four operations remains outstanding.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made it clear without hesitation. &#34;Prepare yourself for legal action.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you possibly be Landen&#39;s student? You never even attended university! You&#39;re lying.&#34; Elora desperately refused to accept reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth-that the person she despised most had become a revered medical genius-was too humiliating to accept.</p>
