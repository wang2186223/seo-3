                <p>Jasper instructed his team to escort Aurora back to her quarters to recuperate, assigning a physician to accompany her-both to safeguard her fragile state and ensure Evelina wasn&#39;t held accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m the type to dwell on grudges or seek petty vengeance, do you,Jasper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had no intention of concealing her true self from him. She believed in living boldly and authentically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I someone you&#39;d descríbe as heartless or cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Jasper wrapped up his sentence, the two shared a smile-subtle yet deeply in tune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were kindred spirits-loyal to their loved ones, yet merciless when facing threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell, urgent update! While we were distracted for a split second, all four suspects took their own lives with poison.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of Jasper&#39;s men rushed in, clearly distressed.&#34;They had capsules hidden in artificial teeth. By the time we realized it, they were gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their trail suddenly going cold, the only information they uncovered was that the group operated internationally,targeting elites through intricate schemes and demanding exorbitant ransoms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll go inspect the bodies and see if anything new turns up,&#34; Evelina offered immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go ahead. I&#39;ll reach out to Interpol-maybe they can shed light on their identities,&#34; Jasper responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They split up to handle their individual missions and regrouped after about thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, take a look at this-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had indeed uncovered something noteworthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pointed toward one of the corpses&#39; ankles. &#34;They each have the same symbol: a black cloud with the word Gods inked.in red underneath.&#34; Jasper&#39;s eyes narrowed. &#34;They&#39;re part of the Sons of the Wind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not taking his eyes off Evelina, hecontinued, &#34;They&#39;re an arm of a notorious global criminal network-the Children of the Gods. They believe they&#39;re divine descendants and carry out heinous acts worldwide.The ones we just apprehended are only one unit-the Sons of the Wind faction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Children of the Gods?&#34; Evelina&#39;s breath caught. The name hit close to home. She had once crossed paths with their members when she rescued Kristina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, she&#39;d barely survived, and the ordeal had forged a deep friendship between her and Kristina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is serious, Jasper. We&#39;ve stirred a hornet&#39;s nest. You need to stay vigilant. They won&#39;t back off so easily,&#34; Evelina warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper scoffed, &#34;You think the Russell family trembles at the feet of a criminal cult?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Children of the Gods dared challenge him, they&#39;d be dragging the entire Russell clan into battle. In essence, they were digging their own graves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Jasper was more worried about Evelina&#39;s safety.&#34;Let me assign you some security personnel,&#34; he offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Evelina had always valued her independence, and the thought of guards trailing her around felt suffocating.She declined respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper didn&#39;t argue, though he quietly arranged for a team of elite operatives to watch her from a distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once everything.was settled in Eastmere, lan and two family guards stayed behind to coordinate with local law enforcement, while Jasper whisked Evelina away in a helicopter bound for lreah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, uninvited but determined, declared she was coming too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was far too rattled to attend the upcoming finance event and just wanted to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No space left,&#34; Jasper said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, ever gracious, made a gesture. &#34;Miss Marsh, you can share my seat if you&#39;re okay with the squeeze.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although visibly displeased, Aurora climbed in quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper shot Evelina a questioning look, clearly puzzled by her offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina glanced at Aurora&#39;s ankle, then said with a knowing tone, &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise to take me to the hot springs tonight? Kristina&#39;s meeting us there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were in swimwear, it&#39;d be easy to spot any telling tattoos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper smirked, barely holding back a laugh. Evelina always had a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before the doors closed, Cary appeared out of nowhere and began forcing his way in, dramatically exclaiming, &#34;Darling, we nearly died back there! You can&#39;t just leave mes If I vanish, what will my grandmother say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Evelina could react, Aurora stepped in and offered her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Mr. Gibson. Sit with her. You two are still legally bound, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved aside to let Cary sit next to Evelina, and was about to position herself beside Jasper.</p>
