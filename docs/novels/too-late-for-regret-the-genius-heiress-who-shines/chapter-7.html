                <p>Evelina hadn&#39;t yet reached the hotel when Kristina&#39;s eager voice came through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? Did you get a glimpse of Jasper Russell? Is he really as ridiculously attractive as everyone says?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, no,&#34; Evelina replied, her tone lightly teasing. She knew exactly what Kristina wanted-juicy gossip. &#34;The man who appeared today was probably just an assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she&#39;d never met Jasper face-to-face, Evelina immediately recognized that today&#39;s visitor, impressive though he was, lacked the unmistakable aura of someone who wielded absolute authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she wouldn&#39;t dream of sharing this piece of gossip with Margot. Better to let that fool chase shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Margot truly dared pursue Jasper, she&#39;d drag the entire Gibson family into a spectacular downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Predictable!&#34; Kristina&#39;s curiosity vanished in an instant.&#34;The Gibsons should feel honored an assistant even bothered with them. Margot genuinely believes she&#39;ll marry into the Russell family? Please! Does she even know what happened to the last woman who dared chase after Jasper? Her entire family disappeared from Ireah&#39;s elite overnight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Born into the powerful Anderson family, Kristina had always steered clear of Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was notoriously ruthless, viewing the world through a stark lens of allies versus enemies. Romance or sentimentality held no meaning to him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of his exceptional physique, undeniable charm, or striking appearance, Kristina stayed well away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On another note, my Queen.&#34; Kristina swiftly changed topics. &#34;I&#39;ve signed some promising new talent. Mind coming by to take a look?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her family&#39;s dominance in luxury hotels globally, Kristina had chosen a different path entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Launching her own entertainment company had become her passion, and scouting handsome young talents from around the globe her specialty. Once refined, she&#39;d thrust them confidently into stardom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina possessed an uncanny instinct for recognizing genuine star power-two of her selections had already risen to immense fame. Naturally, Kristina always sought her input.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure.&#34; Evelina accepted without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, not far away, Jasper sat quietly in the back seat of another vehicle, his phone pressed to his ear as lan Payne, his assistant,relayed details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, Esme Barton is definitely hiding something. But Cary Gibson&#39;s soon-to-be ex-wife, Evelina Marsh...she seems intriguing. Almost as if she&#39;s certain that Esme is a fraud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon-to-be ex-wife?&#34; Jasper&#39;s smooth voice held a subtle intensity. &#34;They&#39;re getting a divorce?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, in progress,&#34; lan explained quickly. &#34;But Cary is openly flaunting his relationship with Esme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Disgusting.&#34; The single word dripped with cold disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Renowned for his composure and cold demeanor,Jasper rarely showed emotion openly. Thus, when he spat out the word &#34;Disgusting,&#34; lan immediately recognized the subtle shift in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All of Cary&#39;s eye surgeries occurred after his marriage to Evelina,&#34; lan continued thoughtfully. &#34;Recovery periods, postoperative care-she was there through everything. Evelina must be closely connected to the genuine Sight Weaver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before even setting foot in Aglonard, Jasper had meticulously investigated everyone tied to Cary.Overlooking details simply wasn&#39;t in his nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep a close watch on her,&#34; Jasper instructed coldly.&#34;And find whatever means necessary to unearth the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the Gibson Mansion...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot had been sobbing dramatically for over thirty minutes straight. &#34;We&#39;re still influential-why shouldn&#39;t I have a shot at him? Why does everyone treat me like I&#39;m not good enough?&#34; she cried out. 4</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely infuriated, Elora and Cary had long since abandoned Margot to her tantrum and gone for their meal. Esme, however, lingered patiently, soothing Margot&#39;s wounded ego. &#34;Margot, can&#39;t you see what&#39;s really happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme paused deliberately, sighing gently as she cupped Margot&#39;s chin, forcing their eyes to meet. &#34;Do you really think Evelina showed up today dressed like that just to irritate Cary?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot immediately perked up, suspicion flashing in her eyes. &#34;Esme, did you notice something strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playing her role expertly, Esme softly explained, &#34;It&#39;s quite possible the butler tipped Evelina off about Mr. Russell&#39;s visit today...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean-she&#39;s after Jasper?&#34; Margot&#39;s eyes blazed,her expression contorted in jealousy. &#34;How dare that tramp try to seduce another man right under our noses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme patted Margot&#39;s shoulder affectionately, like a concerned older sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s exactly like her. Realizing she lost Cary to me,she&#39;s desperately looking for her next target,&#34; Esme whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; Margot sneered dismissively, &#34;Mr. Russell wouldn&#39;t glance twice at a nobody like her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Certainly not,&#34; Esme replied smoothly. &#34;Compared to an elegant and refined lady like yourself, she&#39;s insignificant. But some men are easily tempted by those bold women. While Mr. Russell would never marry someone like her, it won&#39;t stop her from attempting to seduce him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34; Margot practically screamed,cheeks blazing with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margot, sometimes it only takes one night,&#34; Esme murmured slyly. &#34;If Evelina manages that, she&#39;ll be set for life financially. Isn&#39;t that temptation strong enough for someone like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that single remark, Esme cleverly transformed Evelina from mere annoyance to grave competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot trembled violently,fury consuming her entirely.Seizing the perfect moment, Esme casually teased her, &#34;Didn&#39;t Hayden Reid mention his contacts-those hired thugs he&#39;s friends with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot&#39;s eyes widened eagerly, and she instantly grabbed her phone to dial Hayden&#39;s number. &#34;Hayden?Remember how you&#39;ve been begging me for a date?Do one thing for me first-get rid of someone. Then I&#39;ll gladly accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Margot, Esme&#39;s lips curled into a cold, satisfied smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare Evelina humiliate her in front of the Russell family? Esme wouldn&#39;t rest until Evelina was permanently out of her way.</p>
