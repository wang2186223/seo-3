                <p>Evelina and Florrie were seated in an unmarked corporate car in the parking lot outside the pawnshop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper rarely allowed Florrie to accompany Evelina on outings, which made Florrie exceptionally excited today!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think Esme will pawn those earrings? They&#39;re quite famous and unique,&#34; Florrie asked with a hint of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She personally would have sacrificed two villas before letting go of such precious earrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Designed by the illustrious Kristine Carpenter, who only crafted one jewelry piece per year for a predestined owner, those earrings were highly coveted worldwide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Collectors globally vied for Carpenter&#39;s creations, fully aware that their value would only appreciate significantly/over time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded with certainty, &#34;Yes, she will. I&#39;ve asked for a hundred million to perform your eye surgery.Esme is desperate not to be discovered, and she&#39;ll surely scramble to assemble the funds.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s family business overseas wasn&#39;t substantial enough to free up a hundred million quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother Sebastian had tied up his assets in the stock market, rendering him unable to assist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with the Gibson Group currently embroiled in severe financial woes, Esme was left with no choice but to liquidate her most prized possession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Russell family&#39;s bodyguard leaned in and whispered, &#34;Ms. Marsh, she&#39;sarrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina observed Esme walking into the pawnshop, Sebastian by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About thirty minutes later, the pawnshop owner called Evelina to confirm that the transaction was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,Esme and Sebastian exited the pawnshop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, astonished, asked, &#34;Evelina, how did you know Esme would come to this pawnshop? There are many in Aglonard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded with a smile, &#34;This pawnshop is the only one in town capable of handling a hundred million in cash, and I gave her an interest rate that&#39;s half of what others offered. How could she resist?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this pawnshop yours?&#34; Florrie asked,impressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While many heiresses Florrie knew depended on their family&#39;s influence and wealth, Evelina had carved out her own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we go in and have a closer look? You&#39;ve always admired those Starry Nlight earrings, haven&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina took Florrie&#39;s hand, and they exited the car, with the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards trailing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Florrie&#39;s vision had faded, she had once seen the earrings and had always cherished that memory,though she had never touched them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private viewing suite of the pawnshop, Evelina not only allowed Florrie to handle the earrings but also helped her try them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Idris&#39;s daughter has a birthday next month. You can wear these until then, just make sure not to lose them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious, Evelina?&#34; Florrie couldn&#39;t contain her excitement. &#34;Please, take plenty of pictures for me.I want to see them all once I can see properly again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina laughed warmly. &#34;It seems you&#39;ve really taken a liking to these earrings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s not only the earrings,&#34; Florrie quickly added, her enthusiasm undimmed. &#34;The Ocean of Stars sapphire necklace is breathtaking too. I&#39;ve only ever seen it in photos, but it&#39;s magnificent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah,that necklace is also my favorite,&#34; Evelina replied, thrilled to discover their shared taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kristine crafted that three years ago, didn&#39;t she? Since then, she hasn&#39;t produced anything new. Maybe she&#39;s lost her muse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This remark resonated deeply with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent the last three years focused on her duties as a wife and daughter-in-law, healing Cary&#39;s vision, which had caused her to neglect her own desires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name Kristine had almost slipped from her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s tragic, considering Kristine&#39;s stature as a world-renowned designer,&#34; Florrie said sadly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t stop creating,&#34; Evelina said, looking into Florrie&#39;s earnest eyes, which sparked a renewed sense of inspiration within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grinned mischievously. &#34;I predict Kristine will reveal a new sapphire necklace this year, named Angel&#39;s Eye!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie pouted slightly, playful suspicion in her tone. &#34;You&#39;re just poulling my leg, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was no longer a child; did Evelina really think she could be tricked with fantasies?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we place a bet then?&#34; Evelina suggested, her tone playful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had taken Florrie out today not just for fun, but also to lighten her spirits before her important surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here&#39;s the deal: if Kristine releases that necklace, it&#39;s yours-as long as you promise to follow through with your surgery without fuss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s eyes lit up, and she nodded vigorously.&#34;Deal! But what happens if Kristine doesn&#39;t come up with anything new this year?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In response, Evelina smiled warmly. &#34;Then, Florrie, I owe you one wish-anything you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The joy in Florrie&#39;s eyes was unmistaable. She briefly contemplated the endless possibilities, then blurted out, &#34;If that happens, then you have to marry Uncle Jasper-that&#39;s my wish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was momentarily speechless, caught off guard by Florrie&#39;s cheeky demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing together, they made their way back to Morningstar Villas, unaware that they were about to encounter someone unexpected waiting for them at home.</p>
