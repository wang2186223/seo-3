                <p>Evelina shot Aurora a look laced with scorn, igniting a fiery mix of humiliation and rage in the latter&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one but Aurora understood the lengths she&#39;d gone to in order to win Jasper&#39;s affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething, she locked eyes with Mara, who raised the grip of her weapon, poised to strike Evelina once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, Evelina was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite having her arms bound behind her, she launched her head forward, crashing it into Mara&#39;s face before the blow could land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The collision was brutal and took Mara by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood spilled fromn her nostrils, and the world spun around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby captors cursed under their breath, stepping in to make Evelina pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she met their threats with defiance and a smirk. &#34;Half a billion is riding on my safety. Who among you is bold enough to touch me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any harm to her, and that fortune would be lost forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan felt a mix of admiration and frustration-why antagonize them now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he had to intervene. &#34;Mara, you know Mr. Russell doesn&#39;t forgive. If Evelina gets hurt, you&#39;re finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper was obsessively territorial. Anything that once belonged to him remained off-limits-even if he&#39;d let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Evelina had been the first to truly spark his desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what? If he&#39;s so powerful, let him show up and save her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although her bleeding had stopped, Mara&#39;s fury had only grown. She leveled the gun at Evelina&#39;s face, growling, &#34;Jasper, if you&#39;re so brave, come out now-or I&#39;ll end her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the threat was real. Her expression was murder itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Evelina felt a wave of dread, as if death were brushing against her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Jasper&#39;s voice rang out, clear and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared without warning, like a force of nature, and Aurora&#39;s envy ignited like dry tinder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What spell had Evelina woven around him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he seriously risking everything for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay back, or she dies!&#34; Mara&#39;s confidence cracked the moment she locked eyes with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Set her free, and I&#39;ll grant you a clean end,&#34; Jasper warned, his tone glacial and unrelenting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara&#39;s grip faltered as she asked, &#34;Where are your men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kept count-Jasper had arrived with lan and four guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she held lan and one of them. But where were the others?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you guess?&#34; Jasper answered coolly. At that moment, two masked figures staggered in, bringing with them a wounded man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bullet had torn through his forehead; his mask lay shattered, and life was slipping from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Mara&#39;s cousin. Their eyes met one final time before his went dim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Angelo! No! Wake up!&#34; she screamed, her voice breaking, tears flowing uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ones who brought him in pointed accusing fingers at Jasper. &#34;It was him! The Russell family&#39;s bodyguards killed Angelo and freed the captives in the kitchen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by grief and fury, Mara aimed at Jasper. &#34;I&#39;ll shoot you myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, three crimson dots marked her forehead-snipers had her in their sights. Mara froze, unable to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let them go,&#34; Jasper commanded, glancing coldly at Angelo&#39;s corpse. &#34;Or you&#39;ll share his fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move!&#34; barked another kidnapper, gun trained on lan and the remaining guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest followed suit, weapons drawn on Cary and the other high-profile hostages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension thickened-neither side dared to act first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll release them,&#34; Mara said coldly, shattering the silence as she shoved Evelina and Aurora toward Jasper. &#34;Two lives on the line-you get to save just one. Choose now, and the other one dies on the spot!&#34;Her unhinged laughter rang out like a warning bell. &#34;Well, Mr. Russell, who&#39;s it going to be?&#34;</p>
