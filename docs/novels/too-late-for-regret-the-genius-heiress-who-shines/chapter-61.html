                <p>Esme left the director&#39;s office in a rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was about to exit, the door burst open from the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, imposing air swept through the doorwNay,instantly quelling her rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes met Jasper&#39;s, who stood framed by his vigilant bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who do you intend to dismiss?&#34; Jasper demanded,his presence making Esme involuntarily step back in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice softened significantly when he addressed Evelina.&#34;Are you alright? Is everything okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, reassuring him with a nod, inquired, &#34;What brought you here?&#34; Jasper offered only a smile in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina immediately understood Jasper&#39;s reasons for appearing;he was worried about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bright smile dissipated his concern,transforming his anxious expression into one of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Esme was forcibly escorted away by the bodyguards of the Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she had shown bravado in front of Evelina,in Jasper&#39;s presence, her confidence dissolved into sheer terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Kamryn arrived with the lease transfer documents in hand. Without hesitation, Esme signed them, her hand shaking slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina completed the transaction, ensuring the lease rights for Petal Creek Orphanage were securely under her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn eagerly took the documents to finalize all related procedures. In Jasper&#39;s intimidating presence, Esme hesitantly reminded Evelina. &#34;Ms. Marsh, please remember your promise to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1 never break my promises.&#34; Evelina assured her calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was committed to honoring the three conditions Esme had set, though she gave Esme a stern warning, &#34;Make sure you lead an honest life from now on. If you attempt any manipulations against me, I&#39;ll confront you about past and future issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, visibly scared, nodded her head vigorously in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Jasper&#39;s suspicion was not appeased.&#34;Who put you up to targeting the orphanage?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell, if I reveal everything, will you let me go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme had just hastily ended a call with Aurora&#39;s personal assistant when Jasper arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper disliked negotiating and, with a stern look,said,&#34;Talk now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme nearly collapsed in fear, her legs buckling as she hastily named Aurora&#39;s personal assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, caught off guard, asked, &#34;It was not Aurora herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme pleaded earnestly, &#34;Iswear on everything, it wasn&#39;t her. I wouldn&#39;t lie to you about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly showed Evelina the call log on her phone as proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All the details about the orphanage came from that assistant.I assure you, Aurora was not involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme believed if Aurora had directly intervened, she wouldn&#39;t have been put at such risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced they had all the information, Evelina nodded to Jasper, signaling it was okay/ to release Esme. &#34;But can we be certain Aurora didn&#39;t orchestrate this through her assistant?&#34; Evelina still doubted Aurora&#39;s innocence and shared her suspicions openly with Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper was pleased that Evelina trusted him enough to share her doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;I&#39;ve looked into Margot&#39;s situation. She was kept in custody because she assaulted someone,provoked by someone paid by Aurora&#39;s assistant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clues consistently led back to the assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, trust that I will resolve this matter thoroughly.&#34; Jasper assured her with a firm promise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would dare challenge Evelina or threaten those dear to her as long as Jasper was by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A comforting warmth spread through Evelina as she gazed at the man beside her, the impulse to rely on him growing stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for everything today. The kids have put together a little show to express their gratitude.&#34; Kamryn appeared, full of excitement, leading them down to the playground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina blushed slightly. &#34;Oh, Kamryn, that&#39;s really not necessary. This place is like home to me; I&#39;ll always protect it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper chimed in, &#34;No need for formalities. I consider Evelina&#39;s concerns as my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm smile, Kamryn paused before adding,&#34;Evelina, I heard about your divorce. I was concerned it might weigh on you, but it looks like my fears were unfounded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter filled the air. &#34;So,is this Mr. Russell your new boyfriend?&#34;</p>
