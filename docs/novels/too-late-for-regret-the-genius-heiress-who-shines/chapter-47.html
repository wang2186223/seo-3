                <p>Evelina hesitated when Jasper mentionedthen realized he was talking about Aurora. She nodded in understanding.&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So why didn&#39;t she seem happy? She didn&#39;t even bother coming down for dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could delve deeper into his questions, Jasper checked himself, recognizing it wasn&#39;t his place to probe too deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;My family and the Marsh family have to keep up appearances, despite the complexities.That&#39;s why/ I couldn&#39;t just send her away, even though I wanted to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s unexpected presence irked him, yet societal norms required him to maintain a facade of politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina reassured him. &#34;It&#39;s alright, Jasper. No need for theatrics on my account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was puzzled, though, by his need to elaborate so thoroughly as if she might have misconstrued his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s smile showed his relief. &#34;Thank you. Try to rest now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to leave when his phone interrupted with a call from the hospital. &#34;Is this a relative of Aurora&#39;s? You&#39;re listed as her emergency contact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just a friend; what&#39;s happened?&#34; Jasper&#39;s expression turned grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The situation is she&#39;s developed acute gastroenteritis and needs to be admitted immediately,&#34; the caller explained, then disconnected after providing the necessary information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, I have to go to the hospital,&#34; Jasper said, his reluctance clear despite the necessity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s unexpected visit to Aglonard placed Jasper in a difficult position; her well-being was now-his responsibility, complicating matters with her infJuential family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure, take care. I&#39;ll be fine here with Florrie.&#34; Evelina reassured him, sensing his concern was more about leaving Florrie unattended than his own reluctance to visit the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must leave now.&#34; Jasper&#39;s discomfort grew as Evelina made no move to retain him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive safely,&#34; she called out casually as he depated. Barely a moment later, she yawned and retreated to the guest room for some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper departed with a mix of emotions, accompanied by the butler and two maids to maintain proper protocol at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He informed Aurora, &#34;I&#39;ve informed your family. They will make arrangements for your care. These maids will assist you in the meantime. If there&#39;s anything you need, the butler is at your disposal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora lay feeble on the hospital bed, scanning his face for any sign of personal concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression remained impassive, devoid of the concern she so desperately sought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper always maintained a cool demeanor around women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when it came to Evelina, his eyes softened,which puzzled everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under her blanket, Aurora&#39;s grip tightened, jealousy bubbling within her as she struggled to maintain composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize, Jasper. I didn&#39;t mean to complicate things upon my arrival,&#34; she said with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. Our families have long been allies, and it&#39;s natural for us to support one another. Focus on your recovery and try not to worry.&#34; Jasper reassured her without a hint of sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking with her doctor, Jasper confirmed that Aurora&#39;s condition was manageable. He quickly set everything in order and was ready to depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Aurora was desperate to keep him there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had ingested the medicine deliberately to induce her illness, seeking to prevent Jasper from returning to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need to rush back because of Evelina?&#34; Aurora asked. Then she added quickly, &#34;I&#39;m sorry for the trouble. She must be bothered by this, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s expression tightened visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He often wondered if women thought their manipulations went unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie&#39;s surgery is approaching. You&#39;re not involved, so, understandably, you don&#39;t grasp the severity of my concern,&#34; Jasper replied, deliberately omitting any mention of Evelina to prevent Aurora from viewing her as competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s irritation was evident. Even though she knew perfectly well that her frail health made her unfit for traveling, she still came all the way here unannounced. Her presence in Aglonard had only complicated matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Jasper, please, you misunderstand...&#34; Aurora, taken aback, quickly tried to clarify her position.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps I spoke too sternly. Forgive me. It&#39;s commendable that you visited Florre, though she&#39;s not your family,&#34; Jasper replied, his tone softening slightly but his stance remaining firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His remarks made it clear that there was no future for him and Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite this, Aurora persisted, clinging to a connection. &#34;Florrie has always been likea sister to me...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, uninterested in her feigned sentimnents, interjected briskly, &#34;It&#39;s been a long day. Rest now. I&#39;ll visit again tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he departed swiftly, leaving no room for her to detain him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, wait...&#34; Aurora called after him futilely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was burning with hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had crossed a line by encroaching on her territory. Aurora vowed to exact revenge on her.</p>
