                <p>Surgery On Your Behalf</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, I&#39;m the Sight Weaver.&#34; Esme hesitantly took the surgery bill, guilt flashing briefly across her eyes as she scrambled for an explanation. &#34;It seems there might&#39;ve been a mix-up with my lawyer. Perhaps he sent this by mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief filled Cary&#39;s eyes. &#34;Not just a bill-the lawyer included a letter, too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the letter, if the twenty million wasn&#39;t settled within three days, the Sight Weaver intended to sue Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s pulse quickened, yet she managed to maintain her facade. &#34;I distinctly told my lawyer otherwise.How could such an error occur?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing anxiously at the contact number listed below,she reassured him swiftly. &#34;Relax, Cary. I&#39;ll clarify this immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing she couldn&#39;t risk making the call in front of him, Esme discreetly stepped away to a secluded corner before dialing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Caleb&#39;s phone rang. Noting Esme&#39;s caller ID, he promptly handed the phone over to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Activating her voice changer, Evelina answered indifferently, &#34;Yes, who&#39;s speaking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfamiliar with the altered voice, Esme cleared her throat politely and adopted an ingratiating tone.&#34;Good day. I&#39;m Esme Barton-| studied under Professor Landen Mitchell and was a junior to the Sight Weaver. Could you connect me with her directly,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Esme&#39;s sweet tone, Caleb visibly shuddered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman changed personas with unsettling ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is the Sight Weaver,&#34; Evelina said, prompting an enthusiastic squeal from Esme on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello! I&#39;m thrilled to finally make your acquaintance after hearinng so much about you.&#34; Esme greeted with an unusual deference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Evelina remained skeptical.&#34;There was no one by the name of Esme Barton among my mentor&#39;s students.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s cheeks turned red with shame. &#34;Well, I wasn&#39;t formally enrolled, but I did attend some of Professor Mitchell&#39;s lectures. I&#39;m technically your junior-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina interjected sharply, &#34;Let&#39;s skip the pretenses.What do you need?&#34;-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately, Esme said, &#34;There&#39;s an ophthalmology surgery I need help with in three days. Could you possibly oversee my work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laid on her charm thickly, much like she did with her male acquaintances,hoping it would sway Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded firmly and disgustedly, &#34;I&#39;m not available for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme asked, &#34;What if I compensate you generously?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina retorted, &#34;I&#39;m not interested in your money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But surely, everyone has a price,&#34; Esme insisted,trying to bait her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing her final offer, Esme said through clenched teeth, &#34;What if Ioffer six million for a session? Would that change your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina couldn&#39;t hide her disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme was backed into a corner and raised her bid.&#34;Seven million...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina answered with nothing more than a chilly scoff. Esme clenched her jaw. &#34;Ten million-that&#39;s seriously everything I&#39;ve got.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You charged the Russell family fifty million for that surgery on Miss Russell,&#34; Evelina said,knowing well the stakes involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beaded on Esme&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, she had quoted fifty million, conditional on the success of the surgery and Miss Russell&#39;s recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At present, her advance payment was merely ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a fabrication! I never-&#34; Esme stammered, but Evelina cut off the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina instructed Caleb, &#34;Ignore any calls from Esme.She needs time to think over her actions before the operation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme had overstepped by impersonating her and misusing her mentor&#39;s respected name, and now she faced the repercussions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, we&#39;ll leave her to ponder her situation. But Evelina,&#34; Caleb interjected with a change of subject.&#34;Isn&#39;t today your day for shooting practice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, caught off guard, responded, &#34;Shooting practice? Why would I do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s words startled Evelna&#39;s memory. &#34;You set up a shooting contest with Idris from the Ghost Market to trace your biological parents,remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his reminder, the years Evelina had spent seeking her origins came flooding back. Finding her biological parents wasn&#39;t about reunion; it was about understanding her beginnings and the reasons behind her abandonment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout her nationwide search, she had uncovered no leads, pushing her to enlist help from the elusive Ghost Market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors circulated that the Ghost Market&#39;s leader had connections deep enough to find any secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Navigating the market&#39;s unique rules had been challenging, but eventually, Evelina managed to establish contact with Idris Cortez, a key confidant of the market&#39;s boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Idris&#39;s resources, the possibility of locating her parents seemed finally within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When is this contest happening?&#34; Evelina had assumed she had more time to prepare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s expression turned grim. &#34;It&#39;sset for tomorrow.Idris is an acclaimed marksman. You&#39;ll need to outshoot him to gain his assistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This news caught Evelina completely off guard.</p>
