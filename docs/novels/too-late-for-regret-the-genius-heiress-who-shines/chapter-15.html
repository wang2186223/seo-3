                <p>The two girls huddled together behind a tree,clutching their ears tightly and counting loudly, saying,&#34;One,two, three...&#34; Yet, despite their efforts, the eerie sounds of screams still reached them, sending shivers down their spines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears threatened to spill from Florrie&#39;s eyes as she thought of Evelina&#39;s danger, but recalling her stern warning, she bit her lip hard to stop them and continued counting, &#34;Fifty... fifty-one...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the dark, Evelina&#39;s commanding voice echoed, &#34;Still want to fight?&#34; She was standing amid a scene of defeat, iron bar in hand, directing it towards Hayden Reid. The girls&#39; count was nearing ninety-seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden,confronted with his downed crew, stumbled backward,his voice trembling with fear.&#34;N-No more,I swear! Please, have mercy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a decisive swing, Evelina knocked Hayden unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her actions had been swift and fierce, leaving no room for mercy as she expended every bit of her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the adrenaline faded, Evelina felt the toll of the fight. Her muscles ached, her breath was short, and she gestured to the girls. &#34;Let&#39;s go. Time to get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Evelina sway slightly, one girl quickly moved to her side to offer support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Florrie stumbled toward Evelina, her expression filled with concern. &#34;Are you okay, Miss?Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s when Evelina finally felt the sharp sting of a wound across her back-a blow she hadn&#39;t noticed amidst the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina managed a forced smile through clenched teeth. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Let&#39;s move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She harbored a deep mistrust that Hayden might have called for reinforcements. If they were to encounter another attack, their chances were slim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girls flanked her, supporting her as they made their way to an old van parked nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the girls, her eyes filled with tears of gratitude,whispered, &#34;Thank you so much for saving us. I&#39;m Eloise Patel. What about you two?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that the immediate danger seemed over, it seemed right to exchange names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina nodded in acknowledgment. &#34;Evelina Marsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was about to introduce herself excitedly.&#34;Oh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Florrie could reveal her name, the sudden sound of roaring engines cut her off. Several black vehicles sped down the road towards them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re back! The bad guys are back!&#34; The terror was evident in both girls&#39; voices as they screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in the van!&#34; instructed Evelina, using the last reserves of her energy to push them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could pull Evelina into the van,dozens of men dressed in black poured out from the vehicles,quickly encircling them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, sharp knife touched Evelina&#39;s throat. She slowly raised her hands in surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave the girls alone,&#34; she said with forced calmness. &#34;I was the one who fought those men. Take me if you need someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her priority remained their safety, even in such dire circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the van, the girls were crying. &#34;Don&#39;t harm her, you monsters!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir, we&#39;ve located her!&#34; shouted one of the men dressed in black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the group parted, creating a clear path through the middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man, tall and imposing with a cold handsomeness,walked through the divided crowd. Evelina recognized him at once. &#34;The rising star?&#34; she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this not the trainee Kristina had hired? What was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he approached, Jasper RusselI&#39;s jaw clenched, a clear sign of annoyance. This was the woman who had mistaken him for someone less than respectable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ten roses,&#34; he said coldly. &#34;It seems we meet again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill coursed through Evelina; the situation was dire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle!&#34; Florrie&#39;s voice broke through the tension as she recognized Jasper&#39;s familiar tone and rushed out of the van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly moved to embrace his niece. &#34;It&#39;s okay,I&#39;m here now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears were rolling down her face as she clung to him,  sobbing. &#34;You&#39;re so late. There were so many bad people... I thought I was going to die...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Florrie,&#34; Jasper responded with uncharacteristic softness, cradling her gently.&#34;I should have been here sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you had been any later, you might not have found me alive! They were about to kill us-if Evelina hadn&#39;t been there...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping away her tears, Florrie suddenly remembered her manners and turned to introduce her uncle.&#34;Evelina, Eloise, this is my uncle. He&#39;s here now, so there&#39;s nothing to fear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet fear was precisely what Evelina felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing before her was none other than Jasper Russell, and the girl she had rescued was Florrie Russell, the heiress of the Russell family, who had traveled from lreah to Aglonard for eye treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina spotted lan approaching swiftly with a medical team in tow, the wickedness of the situation dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization hit her hard. She had not only mistaken the formidable Jasper Russell for a naive, rookie idol,but she had also flirted with him while intoxicated,armed with a bouquet of roses. Her knees felt weak;she nearly collapsed from the overwhelming  embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Florrie, ever inquisitive, chimed in,&#34;Uncle,have you met Evelina before? You mentioned &#39;Rising Star&#39; and &#39;Ten Roses.&#39; Is that some kind of code?&#34;</p>
