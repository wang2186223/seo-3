                <p>Kristina, impressed from the back seat, exclaimed,&#34;Wow, Mr. Russell controls everything from his seat!His assistant only needed one sentence to take down the mistress. That&#39;s what you call influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie quickly added with pride, &#34;He&#39;s got real power. My uncle is truly unmatched.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the car was filled with their voices,Evelina was quiet,her gaze lost through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina noticed her friend&#39;s distant expression and asked with concern, &#34;Evi,everything alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Evelina&#39;s return, Kristina could sense a weird dynamic between her and Jasper; one enthusiastic,the other cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina managed a weak smile. &#34;I&#39;mn alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, trying to lighten the mood, leaned closer with a playful smile. &#34;What&#39;s on your mind then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina paused, then chose to open up. &#34;Well, your first surgery went well, which is great. But the next one requires a longer interval. My staying at Morningstar might not be necessary anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Florrie&#39;s smile disappeared immediately taken aback by the implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really leaving?&#34; Jasper was quick to respond, clearly anxious about Evelina&#39;s potential departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Evelina replied, attempting to maintain a light tone. &#34;I need to sort out some personal matters,and with Kristina here, it makes more sense for me to stay at a hotel with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie gripped her hand, her expression one of dismay. &#34;But it&#39;s also convenient here, isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t want you to leave, Evi. You&#39;re my closest friend in Aglonard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina softened. &#34;I cherish our time together too,Florrie. But eventually, we have to resume our own lives, don&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She inhaled deeply, steadying her voice. &#34;Plus, your recovery is going well. It&#39;s time for you to think about going back to lreah to continue with your routines.The procedure for the next surgery is straightforward. I can easily come to Ireah to perform it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper now saw the bigger picture- it wNasn&#39;t just about distance; she was distancing herself from the entire Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, struggling with the thought, pleaded, &#34;I&#39;m not ready to go back to lreah. I want you here with me,Evi.&#34; Her voice breaking slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie had everything planned out in advance.When she returned home, she would bring Evelina along so that her parents and grandfather could thank Evelina properly. Evelina would also have the chance to pay her respects at Landen&#39;s grave in lreah, where Esme was expected to make her public apology. &#34;Sweet girl, staying by your side forever isn&#39;t possible,&#34; Evelina said as she softly stroked Florrie&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you can stay!&#34; Tears welled up in Florrie&#39;s eyes.&#34;Marry my uncle, and we&#39;ll never have to part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began streaming down her face, and neither Evelina nor Kristina could console her despite their gentle efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, Jasper was the one who managed to calm his niece. &#34;Evelina is encouraging you to return to Ireah because she cares deeply about you.Remember how you&#39;ve missed your parents and your grandpa? They&#39;re eagerly waiting for you back home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tousled her hair affectionately, addling with patience, &#34;And don&#39;t worry, I will need to finalize a few business matters here in Aglonard later.I&#39;ll bring you along, and you&#39;ll have more time to spend with Evelina every day,won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding up her finger, Florrie managed a tearful smile and asked, &#34;Pinky promise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper linked his pinky with hers, replying, &#34;Pinky promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the dinner that was meant to be joyful and filled with laughter felt empty instead. Quietly, after the meal, Evelina packed her belongings and left the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie walked all the way to the front gate with her.&#34;You&#39;ll visit me often, won&#39;t you, Evi?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the car vanished from view that Florrie collapsed into Jasper&#39;s arms, her tears flowing freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking through the rearview mirror, Kristina saw not only Florrie&#39;s tears but also the sorrow Jasper was attempting to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she couldn&#39;t keep her concerns to herself any longer. &#34;Hey, Evi... did something happen between you and Mr. Russell?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her persistence finally broke through Evelina&#39;s silence. That was the moment Kristina found out about the death of Aurora&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a steady tone, Evelina said, &#34;The day Aurora took her assistant&#39;s body from the hospital, she visited me. She claimed it was to apologize, but her true intent was to warn me. She told me Jasper and I are from different worlds.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s words still echoed in her memory. &#34;Evelina,those born into powerful families can&#39;t choose their loves. Even if Jasper cares for you, his family will obstruct any marriage plans. Think about it, how genuine can his love be? Heed my advice-leave now before the pain grows. You and he are not destined to be together. If not me, he will end up marrying someone deemed suitable by his family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina interjected sharply, &#34;Oh, hell no. She dared to spout that nonsense at you? An adopted daughter of the Marsh family, pretending she&#39;s royalty? It&#39;s clear she&#39;s just bitter because she couldn&#39;t have Jasper, and now she&#39;s trying to prevent anyone else from having him too.&#34; Her eyes quickly darted to Evelina. &#34;Hold on-you&#39;re not actually thinking of giving up on such a good man just because of what she said, are you?&#34; It seemed out of character for Evelina to be swayed so easily.</p>
