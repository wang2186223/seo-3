                <p>Caleb intended to ask about what rumors Aurora had been spreading that caused misunderstandings within the Marsh family regarding his relationship with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, Evelina interrupted decisively, naming her terms boldly, &#34;Alright, one billion!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One billion? You&#39;ve lost your mind!&#34; Damien&#39;s recently settled temper erupted again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You asked me for a price. Unless, of course, Caleb isn&#39;t even worth that much to your family?&#34; Evelina retorted mockingly. &#34;How about this-I&#39;ll use the billion to buy shares in your law firm and gift them directly to Caleb.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina might not rank among the richest globally, but when challenged financially, she never hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Damien was utterly taken aback, stunned speechless for a moment. His voice trembled angrily.&#34;You&#39;ll regret this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damien,listen carefully. You pressured Caleb to apologize to Aurora, who&#39;s clearly pretending to faint, all because of your mother&#39;s situation. Aurora&#39;s behavior is the issue, yet you&#39;re meddling in Caleb&#39;s personal life.&#34; Evelina pointedly criticized. &#34;I thought Caleb rejoined your family seeking warmth and acceptance.Clearly, I was mistaken-you&#39;re hardly real family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing her firm declaration, Evelina confidently ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb stared at her, eyes sparkling with admiration, gripping her arm enthusiastically. &#34;You&#39;re incredible,Evelina! Wait, are you seriously gifting me a billion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had anticipated possible career obstacles for Caleb. Ever since his internship at Starry Law Firm began, she had quietly invested in acquiring substantial shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the amount hadn&#39;t reached a full billion yet, it was quickly approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Caleb planned to marry, she&#39;d have enough for this grand gesture. However, revealing her plans Evelina playfully poked Caleb&#39;s forehead, shaking her head. &#34;Stop dreaming.Go apologize now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what about you?&#34; Caleb hesitated, reluctant to leave her alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prioritize your family situation first. Apologize now so Ady won&#39;t have further reasons to torment your aunt,&#34; Evelina instructed gently. &#34;I&#39;Il handle the issue at the police station. If I need help, I&#39;ll contact you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; Caleb sighed, leaving with obvious reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Evelina drove away from the hospital, Jasper completed the discharge paperwork for Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned to find Florrie pouting, visibly upset. &#34;Uncle Jasper, Ady is outrageous! Aurora clearly faked her fainting, yet Ady has the nerve to complain to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To preserve the family&#39;s public image, the Russells had Florrie apologize to Aurora, though purely for appearances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, it&#39;s unfair.&#34; Jasper consoled his niece gently, stroking her hair comfortingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately afterward, Jasper dialed Ady. &#34;Mrs. Marsh, Jasper speaking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, Jasper,&#34; Ady replied, assuming an apology was forthcoming and responded generously,&#34;Aurora clarified-she fainted purely from exhaustion, not due to your family...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Glad we understand each other,&#34; Jasper interjected coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He showed no restraint. &#34;Otherwise, Mrs. Marsh, I&#39;d advise keeping your delicate granddaughter home rather than letting her create unnecessary disturbánces. Florrie just regained her vision and needs calm, not drama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady replied angrily, &#34;How dare you? Aurora fainted because of your family, and you&#39;re blaming her instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper remained unfazed by her seniority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know better than anyone if Aurora truly fainted or not. I&#39;d have stayed silent, but if she insists on spreading false engagement rumors involving me, I&#39;ll clarify the matter myself. Please remind her-I choose who I marry,not her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you!&#34; A crash echoed through the phone as Ady presumably shattered something in anger. &#34;You disrespectful brat! Even your father wouldn&#39;t dare speak to me this way-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father is tolerant; unfortunately, I am not.&#34; A cold intensity radiated from Jasper. &#34;Keep Aurora under control, or I&#39;ll ensure she regrets it deeply.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34; Ady&#39;s voice strained with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora is merely adopted. Would the Marsh family risk alienating the Russells over someone who isn&#39;t even blood-related? Is it worth the price?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper ended the call decisively, leaving Florrie in utter awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across Ireah, who dared disrespect Ady openly? Only Jasper possessed the audacity to confront her without hesitation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen Evelina?&#34; Jasper attempted calling her, only to find her line consistently busy, deepening his concern.</p>
