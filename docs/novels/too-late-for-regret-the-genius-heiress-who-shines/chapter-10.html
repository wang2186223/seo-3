                <p>The music on the club&#39;s first floor had come to a sudden halt, signaling the end of the talent show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina and the owner of Dusk Lounge, were escorted to the largest VIP suite upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper occupied a spot on the leather couch,his face a mask of cold indifference. Arrayed before him on the table were ten bright red roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing nervously like a troubled schoolgirl, Kristina shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. She mustered up some courage and said, &#34;Mr. Russell, I can explain...This isn&#39;t at all what it seems-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interrupting her, lan&#39;s voice cut through the tension like a knife. &#34;MAs. Anderson, since you seem to recognize the owner of these roses, I suggest you bring them forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While his boss had stepped out for a brief bathroom break, a misunderstanding occurred. In those fleeting moments, he was mistaken for a new trainee and ended up with the roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper Russell was not the type to let such an  embarrassment slide without consequence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s try to ease the atmosphere, Mr. Russell,&#34; Kristina pleaded, her hands joined as if in prayer, begging for leniency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selling out Evelina was not an option for her, not unless they drove her to the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan threatened, &#34;Don&#39;t make us go hard on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though lan would never physically intimidate a well-to -do heiress directly, a simple gesture towards the stern female bodyguard was enough to imply the threat clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mere suggestion made Kristina go rigid with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Kristina could respond, the strain became too much for the owner of Dusk Lounge.He blurted out,&#34;I&#39;lI tell you! The roses were meant for Ms. Anderson&#39;s friend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Kristina glared at him fiercely. The owner was about to reveal Evelina Marsh&#39;s name when Jasper&#39;s phone interrupted the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; In a flash, Jasper was on his feet, his eyes blazing with intensity. He stormed out with lan and the bodyguards in tow,not once looking back at Kristina or the owner of the club.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door of the suite slammed shut, the owner crumpled to the ground,mopping his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled sharply, bewildered. &#34;What just unfolded here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sinking into the couch, Kristina let out a breath as if she had narrowly escaped disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a moment to drink some water and gather her thoughts, she answered, &#34;It&#39;s clear, isn&#39;t it?Something urgent must have cropped up concerning Jasper&#39;s family. He wouldn&#39;t have dashed off otherwise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something urgent?&#34; The owner&#39;s thoughts whirled in disbelief. &#34;What could possibly overshadow his recent embarrassment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina&#39;s gaze fell upon the table where ten red roses lay-a vibrant and yet seemingly accusing presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn Evelina. Had she really tried to charm Jasper Russell with roses? What was the next step?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Anderson? What&#39;s our plan? What if he returns for us?&#34; The owner&#39;s hands trembled once more. He regretted ever agreeing to host this event, knowing now it would spiral into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing out heavily, Kristina reassured him. &#34;Stay calm. My family won&#39;t leave you hanging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her words of comfort, she was already reaching for her phone. Evelina must have been over the limit tonight, confusing Jasper Russell for a new recruit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was urgent she contact her. Immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Evelina wasn&#39;t just anyone; she was the Sight Weaver. If anyone could handle Jasper&#39;s wrath,it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina attempted a call. &#34;The number you&#39;ve dialed is currently unavailable...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distant response from her phone sent a cold through Kristina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she contacted the hotel&#39;s front desk. &#34;Has Evelina made it back to my suite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their negative response propelled Kristina out of the club, she redialed Evelina&#39;s number persistently as she went. Suddenly, a familiar ringtone sounded fromn the flower bed near the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached quickly, finding Evelina&#39;s phone amidst the blooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no.</p>
