            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>&#34;My education was completed abroad using a credit-based system. The faster you earn credits, the sooner you graduate,&#34; Evelina explained calmly, utterly shattering Elora&#39;s final defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speechless, Elora opened her mouth to argue but found herself without words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced with a whirlwind of panic, anger, and disbelief, horrified by Esme&#39;s dangerous deception toward the powerful Russell family. Did this foolish girl not realize the consequences?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread surged through Elora, intensifying with each passing second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing sideways, she spotted Esme cowering against the wall, sobbing hysterically. Without hesitation,Elora lunged forward, grabbing Esme by her hair and striking her repeatedly. &#34;You disgraceful liar! Explain yourself! Your parents are respectable people-how did they raise such a shameless cheat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian remained frozen in shock, barely processing the revelation that Cary&#39;s former wife was, in fact,the legendary Sight Weaver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped to attention only upon hearing Esme&#39;s screams, finally intervening weakly,&#34;Stop hitting her!What&#39;s gotten into you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora refused to relent, gripping Esme&#39;s hair tighter. &#34;She deserves worse! Of all families to deceive, she chose the Russells! Let her bear the consequences alone-don&#39;t drag our family down! We had nothing to do with her lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to show their innocence, Elora continued her furious assault, hoping to win favor from the Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian,helplessly ineffective, turned to Cary. &#34;Your mother has completely lost it. Aren&#39;t you going to stop her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Cary&#39;s attention was entirely focused on Evelina, feeling deeply betrayed and manipulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, let&#39;s leave,&#34; Evelina said softly, uninterested in the chaos unfolding. She was exhausted and simply wanted to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they moved to exit, Esme suddenly wrenched free from Elora&#39;s grip and lunged toward Evelina, only to be promptly knocked down by a Russell family bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lying breathless on the ground, Esme screamed in frustration, pounding the floor. &#34;Why are you only targeting me, Evelina? So many others pretend to be you-why am I the only one paying the price?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Others are impersonating me?&#34; Evelina asked sharply, frowning deeply. &#34;Who else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, lost in self-pity, ignored her question. &#34;You think humiliating me will win Cary back? I won&#39;t let you succeed-he&#39;s mine! I&#39;ve lost him before, and it won&#39;t happen again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wicked girl! You&#39;re using my son as a pawn?&#34; Elora screamed, pouncing on Esme once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Sebastian nor Cary could manage to restrain her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,icy water drenched the fighting women, abruptly silencing the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea stood sternly with the now-empty bucket, glaring furiously. &#34;Have you no dignity? This is a hospital, not a battleground! Keep this up, and I&#39;ll throw every one of you out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After giving them a piece of her mind, she turned and walked away with the empty bucket in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards standing nearby, both the Gibsons and the Bartons stared at her receding back, not daring to protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina turned a cold glare toward Esme, who was shivering on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina said,&#34;Keep Cary all to yourself-but don&#39;t disgust me with your games. My issue isn&#39;t with him but your deceit in my mentor&#39;s name!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank you for letting me know about the others pretending to be me-none of them will escape punishment.Start thinking about your apology at Professor Mitchell&#39;s grave, and don&#39;t even think of escaping. Your malpractice is enough to land you behind bars!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s face turned ashen, and she promptly fainted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Esme entirely, Cary ran after Evelina, blocking her path as she prepared to get in the car. &#34;Don&#39;t you owe me some kind of explanation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I explain exactly?&#34; Evelina retorted coldly.&#34;Would you have believed me if I had told you earlier that I restored your sight, before Esme was exposed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Cary knew deep down he wouldn&#39;t have, he stubbornly insisted, &#34;You still should&#39;ve told me sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1Fyou&#39;re looking for explanations, ask Demi why she also kept it a secret, you fool01:11Evelina retorted sharply,stepping into the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jasper joined Evelina in the car, Cary angrily grabbed the door, confronting her again, saying, &#34;Forget all that-how can you shamelessly associate with this gigolo in public?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Evelina interrupted, finally losing patience. &#34;Gigolo? He&#39;s the actual Jasper Russell!&#34;</p>
