                <p>Jasper,caught off guard,questioned, &#34;What fiancee?&#34;But then, he suddenly grasped why Evelina&#39;s performance had faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His feelings were a mix of delight and irritation. He was pleased because her concern for him had impacted her focus, but he was annoyed by her lack of faith in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she really accepted those rumors about his supposed fiancee without seeking his confirmation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell, aren&#39;t you engaged to Ms. Aurora Marsh from the Marsh family in lreah? It&#39;s a lifelong agreement known since childhood, isn&#39;t it? I may be an outsider,but I&#39;m well aware,&#34; Idris said, appearing to hold all the insider knowledge. His business thrived on trading secrets no one else could access.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, slicing through the implications, asked pointedly, &#34;Did Aurora start this rumor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His disdain for underhanded tactics was evident.He didn&#39;t care to preserve Aurora&#39;s image. &#34;Aurora is merely an adoptee in the Marsh family. The true heiress, Jazmine, has been missing for years. The engagement they talk about was never serious-it was just an old people&#39;s joke. Neither our family nor the Marshes have ever considered it binding. Yet here you are,broadcasting it as if it&#39;s a settled matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s explanations were intended to keep Evelina from worrying unnecessarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself frustrated by her own reactions.Had she really overlooked that Florrie would not have been pushing for her and Jasper if he was engaged?And certainly, Margot wouldn&#39;t have the audacity to challenge an heiress like the Marsh family&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just blabbering, really! I have a terrible habit of speaking without thinking...&#34; Idris, recognizing his misstep, began slapping his own face, hoping to appease Jasper with this gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try to be a bit more persuasive with your self-punishment,&#34; Jasper replied dryly, unimpressed with Idris&#39;s dramatics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing an opportunity to soften Jasper&#39;s stance, Idris turned to Evelina. &#34;Could you perhaps put in a good word for me with Mr. Russell? I assure you, there won&#39;t be any more careless talk from my side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well.&#34; Evelina gave Jasper a knowing look and nodded. &#34;Jasper will dictate the terms for the next matchup.&#34; Jasper decided to escalate the challenge. &#34;Let&#39;s add a twist-blindfolded, we&#39;ll disassemble our guns, put them back together, and then fire three shots at stationary targets to see who truly excels.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Idris and his bodyguard&#39;s faces upon hearing the new challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The task of assembling a gun while blindfolded was daunting enough, let alone aiming accurately at fixed targets without being able to see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell, this is too much for me. Please, can we have something a bit less extreme?&#34; Idris pleaded, his earlier boldness fading as he realized the full extent of Jasper&#39;s support for Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Evelina intervened on Idris&#39;s behalf.&#34;Jasper, perhaps we could ease up just a bit for ldris?&#34;she suggested, her voice carrying a hint of sympathy.Idris quickly nodded his appreciation, hands together in a gesture of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, if that&#39;s what you want, Evelina,&#34; Jasper replied smoothly. &#34;We&#39;ll skip the blindfolds and go for moving targets instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With confident ease, Jasper aimed his pistol and executed three rapid shots at the targets darting across the range.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spectators from the viewing area were astounded.&#34;Did you see that? The targets were darting back and forth like swallows!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the announcer said, &#34;Perfect score-ten rings each for all three shots. Ms. Marsh&#39;s final tally stands at fifty-four rings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers and applause filled the viewing area as the crowd celebrated the impressive display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper demonstrated the skills of an elite sharpshooter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind Florrie, a woman&#39;s voice rang out,exclaiming, &#34;What a show! He&#39;s truly a spectacle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie couldn&#39;t hide her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s performance today was undeniably compelling, likely leaving a lasting impression on Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Idris&#39;s bodyguard was drenched in sweat,while Idris frantically searched for a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, with a smirk, mentioned he had been using his left hand. &#34;Don&#39;t accuse me of unfair play,&#34; he said,implying his ease at the challenge, compelling Idris to reluctantly let his bodyguard take over. The results were as expected. The bodyguard, clearly not adept at hitting moving targets and crumbling under the pressure, only managed to score four rings,one ring, and missed entirely on the last attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Idris had notched up twenty-eight rings in the initial round, his bodyguard&#39;s meager tally of five rings in the subsequent attempt starkly highlighted their combined shortfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through Jasper&#39;s strategic play, he had adeptly made up for the four-ring deficit Evelina had earlier conceded to ldris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper &#34;consoled&#34; Idris with encouraging words, saying,&#34;You were only twenty-one rings short. Just a bit more practice needed for next time,&#34; clearly pleased with their decisive win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, unable to hide his irritation, twitched a forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, glowing in her triumph, reminded him. &#34;Idris,you remember our agreement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris responded, &#34;Fine!&#34; His reluctance was evident,yet he couldn&#39;t back out with Jasper watching.He then added a sly condition,&#34;I&#39;ll assist in locating your parents, but in return, I ask for the Starry Night earrings.&#34;Those earrings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina recalled them instantly-the same ones Cary bought for Esme, costing three hundred million.</p>
