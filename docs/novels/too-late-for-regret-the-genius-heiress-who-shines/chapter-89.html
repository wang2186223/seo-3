                <p>&#34;Jasper, what&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Aurora asked, her voice trembling, hurt flashing across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly what you heard. Do I need to spell it out?&#34; How could Jasper not question her intentions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d assured him they were nothing more than friends, that she would respect that boundary. HHe had taken her at her word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she&#39;d gone behind his back and stirred up trouble with Evelina, who was still emotionally fragile, causing her to believe Jasper was cruel and unfeeling. They&#39;d only just patched things up earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now I understand.&#34; Aurora&#39;s eyes shimmered as she looked between Jasper and Evelina, then addressed her bodyguard. &#34;Mara, we&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Marsh, where do you plan to go? All accommodations nearby are full,&#34; Mara replied anxiously, holding Aurora&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned to Jasper and quickly tried to explain. &#34;Mr. Russell, this is a huge miscommunication. Miss Marsh had a scheduled meeting in lcewell, and we were en route to Newmoor for a finance event. But the vehicle broke down midway, and we couldn&#39;t secure a replacement. Nightfall came, and we had no alternative but to seek shelter here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Icewell, a major hub, indeed hosted several Marsh family enterprises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yes,there was a financial event slated in Newmoor the following afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The path from Icewell to Newmoor led through Eastmere. Everything checked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Jasper&#39;s demeanor remained distant. &#34;Your vehicle broke down? How incredibly convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s complexion turned pale as she turned to leave once more, only for Mara to halt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing close, Mara said in a hushed, urgent tone, &#34;Truthfully, our vehicle didn&#39;t just break down-it was sabotaged.I believe someone wanted us trapped here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze darted subtly toward Evelina, the unspoken accusation hanging in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s expression turned steely. &#34;You believe? Where&#39;s your evidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bodyguard, emboldened by her connection to Ady, clearly had no qualms about confronting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing tension rising, Aurora stepped forward to diffuse the situation. &#34;She&#39;s only speculating. She wasn&#39;t pointing fingers at Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A convenient clarification-but the implication had already landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, unbothered, met their eyes with cool detachment. &#34;Maybe the better question is-who had access to Aurora&#39;s travel plans? Worth investigating. Internal betrayal is far more dangerous than any external threat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara went pale. &#34;Are you calling me a traitor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina gave a thin smile. &#34;Just thinking out loud. But your reaction... interesting. Did I touch a nerve?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara&#39;s fists tightened, ready to retaliate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throwing around wild claims just makes you look ridiculous,&#34; Jasper warned, his eyes sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara backed down, humiliated but still fuming inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the chaos, Jasper agreed to let Aurora stay, assigning her a spot in the luxurious suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara insisted on remaining close, offering to sleep on the bedroom floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan scoffed. &#34;Who do you think you are, suggesting something so inappropriate? Should I assign bodyguards to Mr. Russell and Miss Evelina too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara had no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no available rooms, she was relegated to the staff quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as they stepped into the lavish suite, Aurora wasted no time and immediately laid claim to the grandest bedroom-without so much as a word to anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened to be the room Jasper had specifically arranged for Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Jasper&#39;s patience wore thin, Aurora put on a pitiful face and murmured, &#34;I&#39;m really sorry, but my skin is extremely sensitive. I can&#39;t stay in regular rooms... would it be alright if I took this one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina offered a calm, almost amused smile. &#34;You&#39;re awfully fragile. Perhaps it&#39;s best you stayed in the comfort of your home instead of putting yourself through all this hardship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Aurora another glance, she gently linked her arm through Jasper&#39;s. &#34;Come on, Jasper.Since there are only two rooms in this suite, looks like we&#39;ll have to bunk together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Aurora&#39;s face twisted further in disbelief. &#34;You&#39;re telling me the two of you are sharing a room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was stunned. The upscale suites she had visited always had multiple bedrooms. How had thigs escalated to Evelina and Jasper ending up in the same one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shameless woman! She&#39;d stop at nothing to get Jasper&#39;s attention!</p>
