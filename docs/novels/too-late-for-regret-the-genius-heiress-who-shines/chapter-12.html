                <p>As soon as the sack enveloped her head,Evelina&#39;s senses sharpened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had faced hardships from a young age, often targeted by bullies in the orphanage due to her slight build. Determined, she immersed herself in combat training,eventually becoming a champion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Handling a couple of minor thugs was hardly a challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, a comment they made while seizing her piqued her interest. &#34;Didn&#39;t expect her to be hotter than her picture. It&#39;s our lucky night, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evident that the attack was planned. Someone had provided her photo to these thugs; someone was plotting her disappearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, Evelina ceased her struggles. It was crucial to discover who was bold enough to target her in this small community.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shoved her into a battered old van and drove off, the ride dragging on for what felt like thirty minutes. From the movements of the van, she could tell they&#39;d left the heart of the city and headed straight for the outskirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her familiarity with the local roads, honed by countless grocery trips in a feeble vehicle while caring for Cary, served her well now. she knew the city&#39;s roads like the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the journey, she meticulously tracked each maneuver and pause at the traffic lights. When the vehicle ceased moving, she had deduced a probable location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assailants dragged her from the van and secured her wrists behind her. She adopted a facade of fear,her voice quivering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P-please, where have you taken me? What is the reason for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s gaze swiftly surveyed the area, strategizing her quickest route to freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, there&#39;s no need to fear,&#34; said one of the thugs, his lips curling into a smirk as he licked them.&#34;We&#39;re escorting you to a delightful place-it&#39;ll have you shouting for joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grimy hands gripped her shoulders, pushing her forward toward a desolate, crumbling factory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed her way through the tall, tangled weeds, still keeping up the act.&#34;Please, spare me! If ransom is what you desire,my wealthy husband will satisfy any demand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thugs only chuckled dismissively. &#34;We&#39;re not here for your money. We want you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Undeterred, Evelina replied, &#34;Consider this-I&#39;m pregnant. A pregnant woman won&#39;t command a high price. However, my husband would pay handsomely for my safe return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This information caused them to hesitate. &#34;Damn,&#34;one muttered. &#34;Mr. Reid didn&#39;t mention she was pregnant. What&#39;s our next move?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina seized on the mention of a name. &#34;Mr. Reid? Is he someone significant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Believing Evelina&#39;s fate was sealed, the thugs dropped their guard. &#34;You&#39;ve never heard of Mr. Reid?&#34; one mocked. &#34;He&#39;s the sole son of the Reid family heir from the west side of Aglonard-a bigwig. He&#39;s also tight with Miss Margot Gibson. You upset a person you shouldn&#39;thave, sweetheart. To cross her of all people...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the thugs laughed softly. &#34;Miss Gibson wants you gone permanently. But we? We&#39;re not as heartless. We don&#39;t like the idea of ending you like that...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot Gibson was behind this? Shock seized Evelina&#39;s breath. The revelation was almost too much to grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past three years, she had loyally served the Gibson household-as a devoted wife, a compliant daughter-in-law,and a respectful sister-in-law. She had fulfilled every expectation flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always perceived Margot as merely a sharp-tongued, petty, and spoiled individual. But a desire to see her dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s hands slowly balled into fists. Alright then. If this was the battle to be fought,she was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve arrived!&#34; exclaimed another thug. He pushed her towards a decaying doorway, the foul odor assaulting her senses first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the rusted metal door stood another man,keychain clinking as he appraised Evelina with a lascivious gaze,his eyes lingering greedily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, tonight&#39;s catch is exceptional. Each woman is more attractive than the last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on. Evelina&#39;s gaze sharpened. There were more victims?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been gearing up to confront them head-on -yet,she hesitated at this new information. The man who had manhandled her kicked the doorman sharply. &#34;Stop staring. This one&#39;s pregnant Let Mr. Reid figure out her fate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorman scoffed. &#34;So? Her being pregnant doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t provide some entertainment.&#34;He smirked, unlocking the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was pushed through the door with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as she entered, a chorus of terrified screams greeted her. The room, dimly lit by a flickering yellow bulb, revealed two young women cowering in the corner, their wrists secured behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both appeared no older than twenty, and strikingly beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One girl glanced up at Evelina, her expression vacant and distant-she was blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough noise!&#34; the guard shouted from behind them &#34;You&#39;ll have plenty of time to scream later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a loud clang, he secured the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, their laughter was harsh and mocking. &#34;I&#39;ve picked the most attractive one. That waist, that figure -she&#39;s going to be unforgettable. The blind girl is for Pockmark. And you, Big Nose, you get what&#39;s left.Hahaha!&#34;</p>
