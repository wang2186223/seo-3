                <p>&#34;Is that what you want? For me to beg?&#34; Evelina&#39;s tone was cold as she stared down her former husband,recalling the three years she had dedicated to him.Her words fell with a cold clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary and Elora, misinterpreting her resolve as submission, shared looks of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s expression was particularly disgusting, filled with arrogance. &#34;You need to kneel and beg for forgiveness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan&#39;s hands balled into fists, his restraint was evident.He thought that the Gibson family should be grateful that his boss had not attended in person, for the consequences for the Gibsons would have been terrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. You&#39;ve brought this upon yourself.&#34;Without another word, Evelina swung her hand,landing a sharp slap on Cary&#39;s complacent face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact turned Cary&#39;s head sharply, his cheek rapidly swelling and turning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora shouted, &#34;Evelina, how dare you strike-&#34;&#34;Utter another word, and he gets another,&#34; Evelina retorted, her fury undiminished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora,typically/a bully towards the weak but cowering before the strong, was cowed by Evelina&#39;s ferocity and chose silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina stepped closer, seizing Cary by the collar.&#34;Was I too kind to you? Have you forgotten the scorn you faced during your blindness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During Cary&#39;s period of blindness, Elora had merely wept and lamented, offering no support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot was equally useless, criticizing Cary for his incapacity,while Demi abandoned him, seeking a new leader for the Gibson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the turmoil, Cary&#39;s uncle took advantage of the chaos and assumed leadership of the Gibson Group.His reign was marked by the frequent degradation of Cary,Elora,and Margot, making their lives a misery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina became the pillar of the family,urging Cary to patiently wait for the right moment while orchestrating the restoration of his sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Utilizing her extensive network and assets, Evelina cleared a path for Cary to regain his role as CEO of the Gibson Group. Her investment vitalized the company, elevating it to its current prosperity Could Cary truly believe that all of their success stemmed solely from his abilities?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After scolding Cary, Evelina brushed past him and made her way to visit Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by the slap, Cary touched his cheek, his senses slowly returning.Anger boiled within him as he longed to retaliate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan intervened, placing a calming hand on Cary&#39;s shoulder. &#34;Haven&#39;t you grasped that without Ms.Marsh&#39;s intervention, you&#39;d have been powerless against your uncle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary blinked in confusion. &#34;How could a housewife contribute to my success?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan shook his head in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to such a naive man, his former wife controlled six major corporations and owned more than twenty mines. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering Demi&#39;s room, Evelina&#39;s anxiety eased at the sight of Demi suffering only from a cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She softly warned Demi, &#34;Don&#39;t take a cold lightly. At you age, and with the seasons shifting, it&#39;s crucial to stay warm and steer clear of cold dishes.&#34; Evelina prescribed medicine to Demi and meticulously instructed the household staff on signs of concern to monitor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grasping Evelina&#39;s hand firmly, Demi expressed her gratitude. &#34;You truly look after me like no one else in this family does.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora, unable to contain her displeasure, interjected sharply, &#34;Demi, don&#39;t be fooled by her facade! She&#39;s not who you think she is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had restrained herself from discussing Margot&#39;s predicament at Cary&#39;s request and out of concern for Demi&#39;s fragile health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the day&#39;s events-Evelina slapping Cary and forcing Elora to apologize-had pushed her to her limnit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She Landed MMargot in police custody, and she still hasn&#39;t been released!&#34; Elora&#39;s voice shot up into a dramatic wail as she burst into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, tears in her voice, &#34;Margot, who grew up in comfort, is suffering like never before. How did I ever deserve such a terrible daughter-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by the news, Demi asked anxiously,&#34;What&#39;s this about Margot at the police station? What happened?&#34; Evelina, noticing Demi&#39;s distress, quickly provided a pill to calm her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Elora persisted in maligning Evelina,regardless of Demi&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margot&#39;s just a child; what could she possibly have done wrong? It&#39;s all Evelina&#39;s doing-she accused Margot of orchestrating a kidnapping when in fact Evelina herself probably got tangled up with criminals _&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan finally lost his patience and interjected, &#34;Mrs.Gibson! Today has been eye-opening indeed.Hayden Reid and his crew have all confirmed that it was Margot who told them to abduct Ms. Marsh. That&#39;s the reason she&#39;s been arrested. How can you stand there and lie to Demi?&#34;</p>
