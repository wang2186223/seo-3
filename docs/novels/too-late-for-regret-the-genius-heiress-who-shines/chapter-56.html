                <p>Aurora&#39;s gaze instinctively flicked to Jasper, silently pleading, but he remained unmoved, offering no defense on her behalf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation surged through her, draining the color from her cheeks and causing her knees to tremble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb, maybe you&#39;re unaware-being new to the Marsh family-but there&#39;s long been a pact tying the Marsh and Russell bloodlines. With Jazmine no longer around, I&#39;m the sole remaining daughter. It falls on me to honor that pact.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to salvage her pride, Aurora clung to the verbal agreement once exchanged by the families&#39;elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s anger flared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his fists, he retorted, &#34;Who claimed Jazmine&#39;s gone? You&#39;re adopted into the Marsh name. Are you just hoping they never find their real daughter? Let me make it clear: forget it! I was missing for years and still got brought home. Jazmine will come back too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s face lost all color as Caleb&#39;s words hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes. &#34;T-That&#39;s not what I meant. Of course, I truly hope Jazmine comes back soon...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb sneered, &#34;Cut the act. You don&#39;t need to pretend-your grandmother isn&#39;t here to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora.&#34; Jasper&#39;s voice was laced with ice as he finally broke his silence. &#34;That so-called marriage vow? It was nothing but idle talk between elders. Stop shackling yourself to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s tears fell instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she&#39;d learned of thie arrangement, she&#39;d worked tirelessly to be the perfect partner for Jasper.And now he dismissed it as nonsense? Adelusion she&#39;d forced on herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right, Aurora,&#34; Florrie added gently. &#34;You&#39;re brilliant and stunning-you deserve someone who truly sees your worth. My uncle simpoly isn&#39;t that person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Florrie could sense the incompatibility between Aurora and Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They clearly weren&#39;t meant to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was best for Aurora to release her grip on a one-sided hope before things soured further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m to blame! I should never have...&#34; Aurora gasped, clutching her chest before collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina moved to help, but Aurora&#39;s bodyguard was quicker, lifting her into his arms with a sharp look at everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s brows furrowed in guilt. &#34;Was that my fault? Did I say something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does this have to do with you?&#34; Caleb sneered. &#34;She&#39;s putting on an act. Gave her grandmother a kidney, has such a supporter wrapped around her finger, and now pulls the sympathy card whenever it suits her. When she wants someone out of the picture, she pretends to pass out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, sharp as ever, had already picked up on the connection between Caleb and Aurora based on their exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease crept in. &#34;Is Aurora trying to push you out of the Marsh household?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb was unfazed. &#34;Does she even hold that kind of influence? My aunt is Vivienne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina&#39;s her real objective.&#34; Jasper quickly grasped Aurora&#39;s scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Caleb&#39;s aunt and three cousins shielding him, even Ady found it difficult to confront him directly.But Evelina? She was far more vulnerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Caleb&#39;s expression shifted. &#34;She wouldn&#39;t dare! If anyone lays a finger on her, they&#39;ll have to deal with me-wait a second!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden thought struck him, and he jabbed a finger at Jasper. &#34;The friction between Aurora and Evelina-it all started because of you and your messy love life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper paid no mind to Caleb&#39;s bluntness. He turned to Evelina, voice soft. &#34;You don&#39;t have to be afraid.I won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve got me too, Evelina,&#34; Florrie said, clutching her arm. &#34;I&#39;ll stand by you. Actually, I should tell my mom, dad, and grandpa that you helped restore my vision!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie wasn&#39;t just offering support-she was ready to rally the entire Russell clan to keep Evelina safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You smart lady.&#34; Jasper couldn&#39;t helpo but be fond of such a warm-hearted niece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Evelina&#39;s phone began to buzz.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Demi. &#34;Evelina, Margot still isn&#39;t back... Is something wrong?&#34;</p>
