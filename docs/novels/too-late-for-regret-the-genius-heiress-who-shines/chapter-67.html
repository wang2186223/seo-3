                <p>&#34;If my feelings for you hadn&#39;t clouded my judgment,I wouldn&#39;t have been envious of Evelina. That envy led my assistant to make a reckless decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears marked her cheeks as she said, &#34;The world is full of decent men, not just in Ireah. Why did I fixate on you? If my assistant suffers, what becomes of her young sister? She&#39;s just a child. How will she cope without her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Jasper exited, Caleb remained vigilant, keeping a watchful eye on Aurora to ensure she didn&#39;t stir up further issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she just sat there, lost in her despair, making no further moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s heart softened slightly towards her. Aurora had always been a master of pretense, yet she lacked the cold ruthlessness of Ady. &#34;Stop your tears,&#34; Caleb said as he extended a handful of tissues to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she ignored the gesture, he pressed the tissues into her hands forcefully. &#34;You&#39;re a Marsh.Shouldn&#39;t you at least try to maintain your dignity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is maintaining appearances going to bring her back?&#34; Aurora replied, her voice cracking, followed by a coughing fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a moment to compose herself. &#34;She made a mistake, but did she deserve such a harsh fate? Why did you have to press her so relentlessly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora, you shouldn&#39;t have been dragged into this mess. I regret that it reached this point,&#34; Jasper said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was taken aback by Aurora&#39;s disheveled appearance. It was a stark contrast from the meticulous image she always maintained, and it stirred a pang of pity in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve done nothing wrong, Jasper. Wat could I possibly hold against you? I know it was just your deep concern for Evelina that made you lose your calm,&#34; Aurora said, her voice tinged with a mix of resignation and a lingering hope that Jasper might contradict her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Jasper said nothing, his silence serving as an admission to his feelings for Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you saying she&#39;s innocent?&#34; Caleb&#39;s surprise was evident, his previous understanding flipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The control over the assistant&#39;s sister doesn&#39;t lie with her.&#34; Jasper relayed the findings from the Russell family&#39;s thorough investigation. They were known for their accuracy and wouldn&#39;t be wrong on such a critical matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on Caleb at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Aurora wasn&#39;t the one manipulating events, then the true manipulator had to be Ady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization that the assistant would rather face death than expose Ady suggested the terrifying extent of Ady&#39;s influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora, we&#39;re doing everything possible to save your assistant, and I believe she will survive.However,her actions were grave, and they cannot be overlooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper never left room for debate when it came to protecting the people he cared about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora understood he wasn&#39;t asking-he was telling her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she kept pleading, hoping he&#39;d bend the rules for her just this once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, I will personally apologize to Evelina. From here on, I assure you, my regard for you will be strictly platonic. Please, would you consider sparing her? Her little sister depends solely on her; the little girl cannot afford to be without a guardian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s denial came swiftly, answering, &#34;No.&#34; He was resolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despair washed over Aurora instantly, a feeling of finality that seemed to crush any remaining hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s tone then shifted slightly, more gentle and assured. &#34;However, I assure you that once her sentence is served, she will be in a position to resume her responsibilities to her sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the start, Jasper had only intended to issue a stern warning to the manipulator behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered in Aurora&#39;s eyes as she suddenly brighten up. &#34;Jasper, I believe in you. Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words of gratitude were abruptly interrupted by a nurse who burst into the room, shouting, &#34;Terrible news! Ms. Marsh, I&#39;m sorry, but your assistant didn&#39;t make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Shock contorted Aurora&#39;s face as she demanded an explanation, asking, &#34;How is that possible? She was perfectly healthy; how could she just die?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The assistant suffered from undiagnosed hypertension and other hidden ailments.Unfortunately, attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse, visibly saddened and still young, tried to offer some consolation to Aurora. &#34;I&#39;m truly sorry for your loss, Ms. Marsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed by the news, Aurora&#39;s body gave way,and she fainted, collapsing onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper and Caleb, caught off guard, glanced at each other, each hesitating, mistakenly thinking the other would react to catch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb eventually lifted Aurora from the floor and gently laid her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the nurse called a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Jasper&#39;s watchful eye, the doctor delivered a straightforward diagnosis. &#34;Ms. Marsh has collapsed from acute stress, but she should recover fully with some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb observed wryly. &#34;She&#39;s faked fainting before,but this time it&#39;s genuine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he felt a pang of sympathy, he also thought Aurora was merely reaping what she had sown. As the situation grew more complex, Caleb turned to Jasper and voiced his concern, saying, &#34;Now that Aurora has genuinely fainted and someone has died,what&#39;s our next step?&#34;</p>
