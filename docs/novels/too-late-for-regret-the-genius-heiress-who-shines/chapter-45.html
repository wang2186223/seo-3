                <p>That was a pretty woman, about the same age as Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her appearance might not immediately draw the eye, but the ensemble of her features created an undeniable allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth emanated from her; when Florrie walked through the door, she greeted Florrie with a smile that was both gentle and inviting, saying, &#34;Florrie, you&#39;re back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This greeting, simple yet heartfelt, conveyed deep affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To an outsider, she could easily pass as Florrie&#39;s older sister due to her mature charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing the voice, Florrie expressed her surprise. &#34;Aurora, what a surprise! What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Florrie was not displeased to see her, she was taken aback, knowing Aurora&#39;s typically hectic schedule. She added, &#34;Your visit must have been quite the effort; Aglonard is not just around the corner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora replied with concern, &#34;With your surgery upcoming, I felt it was important to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved towards them gracefully, her eyes quickly flicking to Evelina before she took Florrie&#39;s hands in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gesture subtly implied that she saw Evelina as just a helper, even though it was delicately done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, asserting her preference, said, &#34;I appreciate it, but Evelina&#39;s support is all I need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to Evelina&#39;s hand, her comfort visibly anchored in the latter&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning her attention to Evelina, Aurora asked politely, &#34;And who might this be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie proudly responded, &#34;This is Evelina Marsh, invincible and revered by all-a true gem.&#34; She was enthusiastic in her praise, ensuring Aurora recognized Evelina&#39;s importance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora had never heard such praise from Florrie, and a flicker of envy was evident in her eyes upon hearing Florrie&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been secretly impressed by Evelina&#39;s beauty even before the latter entered the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s appearance was distinctly commanding, a rare type of beauty that even the elite of lreah would acknowledge as exceptional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety surged within Aurora. Jasper had left Ireah just days ago, and already a woman of such allure was by his side?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Evelina. Isn&#39;t it interesting that we both carry the Marsh surname?&#34; Aurora maintained a gentle smile,but her words were tinged with subtle implications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was, after all, from the illustrious Marsh family of Ireah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, it&#39;s nice to meet you,&#34; Evelina replied, maintaining politeness but with a reserved tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora represented herself as Jasper&#39;s fiancee from the Marsh family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Jasper&#39;s apparent disinterest, Aurora had set her sights on securing their marriage, a fact well-known to Florrie who had observed her consistent efforts to win him over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina chose not to linger around Aurora, particularly with the surgery impending. Any distraction could prove costly, akin to the stakes at the shooting range.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In high-stakes surgery, unlike a shooting contest, there is no room for error.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning exhaustion, Evelina said, &#34;I think I&#39;ll head to my room for a bath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you staying here in the villa?&#34; Aurora demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had arrived loaded wih her travel bags, only to learn from the housekeeper that during this sensitive time, visitors were not permitted to stay overnight-an explicit directive from Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So how come Evelina was exempt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, Evelina stays as my personal physician to monitor my health,&#34; Florrie explained, hoping her response would also deter Aurora from considering an extended stay. Yet Aurora insisted, &#34;Florrie, I&#39;d like to stay with you as well. After such a long journey, it feels unsafe to seek accommodations elsewhere...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie found herself unable to reject the request, and Evelina didn&#39;t feel it was her place to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll check with Uncle Jasper,&#34; Florrie said, her youthful indecisiveness leading her to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the doorway, Jasper&#39;s authoritative voice interrupted, &#34;No need for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just wrapped up some urgent business at the Russell Group&#39;s local office and walked in just as Aurora expressed her desire to stay over. He quickly dismissed the idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears formed in Aurora&#39;s eyes as she looked at him imploringly. &#34;Jasper, why can&#39;t I stay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper glanced at Evelina, relieved to see she appeared unaffected by the situation before he allowed himself a subtle sigh of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To prevent any potential misunderstandings,&#34; he explained crisply, his voice reflecting a hint of annoyance.&#34;You understand, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
