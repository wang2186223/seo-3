                <p>Esme visibly recoiled under Demi&#39;s demanding glare,her palms suddenly slick with nervous perspiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately, she stammered an excuse. &#34;There have been countless surgeries... I honestly can&#39;t recall each one clearly-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>surgeon who forgets the procedures she has performed?&#34; Evelina smoothly interrupted, her voice tinged with mockery. &#34;It seems you&#39;re nothing but an imposter. Care to prove me wrong with a little wager?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot burst out indignantly. &#34;Who are you to challenge Esme like that?&#34; But she instantly fell silent when Elora silenced her sharply, reminding her of decency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unfazed, Evelina&#39;s eyes sparkled with quiet defiance as she addressed Esme again, saying,&#34;Miss Barton, if your claims are legitimate, surely this won&#39;t faze you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! I accept your ridiculous bet.&#34; Esme tightened her grip around Cary&#39;s arm, convinced she saw right through Evelina&#39;s game. &#34;You&#39;re clearly desperate to win Cary back, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pathetic,&#34; Elora sneered disdainfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Elora,wealth equaled respectability. Those lacking it deserved neither acknowledgment nor courtesy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to be provoked, Evelina coolly fixed her gaze on Esme, her tone deceptively gentle. &#34;Here&#39;s the bet -prove you can restore Florrie Russell&#39;s sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of your slander!&#34; Cary growled angrily.&#34;Esme reviewed Florrie&#39;s medical records herself and assured me she can treat it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Cary had handed Esme the detailed medical reports sent by the Russell family. She had confidently declared Florrie&#39;s condition manageable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Privately, Esme cursed Cary&#39;s gullibility. She&#39;d made those promises purely to sound impressive, not expecting they&#39;d be seriously tested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful,&#34; Evelina responded calmly. &#34;Then let&#39;s be clear-if you fail, you&#39;ll apologize publicly at Professor Mitchell&#39;s grave and confess your deception to the global media.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked forward to seeing Esme squirm her way out of that scenario.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re shameless,&#34; Cary scoffed dismissively. &#34;You&#39;ll do anything to tarnish Esme&#39;s reputation. What if she succeeds-what then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without skipping a beat, Evelina responded confidently, &#34;Then I&#39;ll openly admit my error for everyone to see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not good enough!&#34; Margot interjected fiercely. &#34;If Esme wins, you&#39;ll vanish from my brother&#39;s life forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Agreed,&#34; Evelina affirmed without hesitation. Her eyes scanned the room thoughtfully before settling deliberately on one individual. &#34;Would you witness our bet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up to meet her unwavering, clear gaze,the distinguished man hesitated briefly, then agreed simply, &#34;Certainly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashing an effortless, radiant smile, Evelina replied confidently, &#34;Good. With a credible witness present,no one can wriggle out of this later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly defensive, Esme retorted bitterly, &#34;Who exactly are you accusing, Evelina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; Demi&#39;s voice thundered decisively,silencing the room immediately. &#34;Esme, remember your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This impostor dared present herself as the legendary Sight Weaver in front of the prestigious Russell family?She risked dragging the entire Gibson lineage through disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratefulness washed over Demi as she realized Evelina&#39;s presence was their only saving grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina leaned close to Demi, whispering reassuringly,&#34;Leave Miss Russell&#39;s treatment to me-but it will be the final favor I ever grant the Gibson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quiet resolve, Evelina turned gracefully and exited without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was done wasting her time in this toxic environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora rejoiced at her departure. Worried the Russells might confuse Evelina for family, she loudly called after her, &#34;Cary will handle the divorce papers first thing tomorrow. Don&#39;t you dare delay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intently, the handsome man observed Evelina&#39;s departure, his thoughtful eyes narrowed with intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware, Elora pivoted to him with exaggerated politeness. &#34;Mr. Russell, please stay for lunch-my daughter has prepared a special performance in your honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely acknowledged her offer, dismissing it curtly.&#34;No,I have other matters to attend to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing Esme with a steely, unreadable gaze, he continued evenly, &#34;Miss Barton, since you&#39;ve confidently claimed you can treat my niece, I expect you to be fully prepared. The first operation is scheduled in one week&#39;s time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one week?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic surged through Esme immediately. &#34;I-I might need more preparation time-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s your concern, not mine,&#34; he replied coldly.&#34;You&#39;ll have top-tier equipment and a skilled medical team at your disposal. Just ensure your success. State your fee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t expecting miracles instantly-but if she couldn&#39;t even begin the procedure, her deception would be blatantly clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned away, Margot hurried forward, eager to accompany him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a few steps, the bodyguards swiftly redirected her, sending her back in embarrassment. Angrily,she stomped her foot, sobbing dramatically as she rushed to Cary and Elora for comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi leveled a stern glare in Margot&#39;s direction.&#34;The Russells are beyond your reach-accept it.And you-&#34;She turned sharply on Elora. &#34;Teach your daughter some dignity.&#34;</p>
