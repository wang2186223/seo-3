                <p>In a panic, Sebastian searched for his phone, only to realize he hadn&#39;t secured the contact details of the stock genius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed himself for his oversight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had delivered a goldmine right into his hands,and he had failed to secure it properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid his growing anxiety, his phone buzzed to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, he answered the call, and Esme&#39;s worried voice filled his ear. &#34;Sebastian, where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience worn thin, Sebastian retorted sharply,&#34;Where do you think I am? There&#39;s only one place I could be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sebastian!&#34; Esme&#39;s voice cracked with emotion, her tears evident. She was well aware her brother was embroiled in his stock endeavors again. &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise to accompany me to lreah today? Have you forgotten?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite Evelina&#39;s resilience, she now needed to travel to lreah&#39;s southern suburbs to make amends at Landen&#39;s grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian had vowed not to let her undertake this alone, yet he had allowed the promise to slip from his mind completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does that even matter? Leave me alone!&#34;Frustrated by his sister&#39;s persistent sobbing,Sebastian ended the call abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Esme persisted, her calls flooding in one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Sebastian&#39;s mind raced as he tried to devise a way to reconnect with the elusive stock genius.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian repeatedly ended calls from Esme until he finally said, &#34;Stop it, Esme! Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy with actual work? I don&#39;t have time to constantly cater to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he spat out those words, he realized he hadn&#39;t recognized the number he&#39;d answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the unmistakable voice of the stock market maven emerged from the phone. &#34;Sebby, why all the fuss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Sebastian&#39;s tone shifted fromn annoyance to sycophantic charm. &#34;Where have you been? I&#39;ve been scouring the stock exchange for you-l was afraid you&#39;d left me. What would I do without you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Evelina nearly choked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she maintained her role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it me who called? You&#39;re such afaithful soul -I couldn&#39;t possibly abandon you. Listen, I have an urgent matter that requires me to leave Aglonard for a few days. Use this number to reach me going forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian was indifferent to her reasons; his focus remained solely on the benefits she brought him from the stock market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He promptly asked, &#34;Now that you&#39;re leaving, will you be trading online during these next few days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a subtly mischievous smile, Evelina set her strategy in motion. &#34;Sadly, my vision isn&#39;t what it should be. Staring at a computer screen for too long is too taxing, so no online trading for me. Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do-l&#39;ll let you use my VIP trading suite. You take over my trading duties while I&#39;m away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian was ecstatic, exactly what he had hoped for. Still, he feigned reluctance. &#34;Doesn&#39;t this feel a bit improper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina quickly squashed any objections. &#34;It&#39;s settled then. We&#39;re friends; let&#39;s keep it simple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian beamed, unable to hide his enthusiasm.&#34;Of course! I&#39;ll do exactly as you say. Teaming up with you is like winning the lottery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then detailed a list of stocks for him to monitor,instructing him to buy them aggressively once their prices hit her specified level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, she handed over her stock market account credentials, instructing him to take good care of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delighted by her trust, Sebastian pledged to handle it with utmost care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her flight was called over the airport loudspeaker,Evelina quickly replied, &#34;I have to head out now. Get in touch if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Safe travels,&#34; Sebastian said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after ending the call, Sebastian, reveling in his newfound status, started requesting the luxurious amenities of the VIP room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was all set to dive into the luxurious lifestyle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, he was relishing a selection of fine imported fruits and enjoying the services of a massage therapist. Sebastian felt so at ease, he almost lost track of his surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When another call from Esme interrupted his peace,he swiftly moved to add her number to the block list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he was going to accompany his sister to lreah and face potential embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His plan was to stay put, manage the affairs of the stock market savant, and accumulate vast wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the airport lounge, Esme was seething with anger to the point of tears after finding out Sebastian had blocked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Cary being too preoccupied to escort her to Ireah was somewhat forgivable, her brother&#39;s outright abandonment was not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t realize was that Cary had already boarded his flight to lreah in first class.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had orchestrated a minor disruption at the airport via a friend, ensuring Kristina would miss her flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All these maneuvers were crafted to facilitate an unplanned meeting with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina approached her seat, Cary cheerfully initiated a conversation from the seat beside hers.&#34;What a coincidence!&#34; he said with a smile.</p>
