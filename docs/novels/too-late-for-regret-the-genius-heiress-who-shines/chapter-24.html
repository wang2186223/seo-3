                <p>Evelina raised an eyebrow, unable to suppress a smirk.&#34;Really? I had no idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to Esme,Evelina habitually reserved the more expensive Platinum Suite, which explained her ignorance of the Gold Suite&#39;s relatively modest price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme,unaware of Evelina&#39;s usual preferences,flashed a victorious grin. &#34;It&#39;s understandable that you wouldn&#39;t know. Such places aren&#39;t common knowledge among housewives. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll catch on to the finer things in life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina couldn&#39;t help but find the situation comically absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb,meanwhile,bristled visibly, his temper on the verge of erupting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the previously dismissive receptionist transformed, her demeanor becoming obsequiously sweet as she addressed Esme. &#34;A guest for the Gold Suite? That&#39;s exceedingly rare. We hardly ever have those occupied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deferential bow, she continued, &#34;You must be Mrs. Gibson, right? Mr. Gibson is a fortunate man-having a wife who is both beautiful and sophisticated.&#34;She ushered Esme forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, soaking in the flattery, shot Evelina a triumphant glance that seemed to say, &#34;Clearly, I&#39;m the rightful Mrs. Gibson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her head high, she replied, &#34;Cary really wanted to reserve the Platinum Suite, but unfortunately, it&#39;s off-limits to the general public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist nodded eagerly in agreement.&#34;Exactly, the Platinum Suite is reserved exclusively for our major shareholders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;In my three months here, I&#39;ve only seen it opened for one of Aglonard&#39;s top magnates, a person of immense wealth and influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme paused in her tracks, then swiveled back towards Evelina, her tone thick with feigned kindness.&#34;Don&#39;t be shy, Miss Marsh. Join us for dinner.Cary and I would love your company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded with a measured smile. &#34;|appreciate the offer, but I&#39;ll decline.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Esme&#39;s face contorted slightly.&#34;I was just being polite...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist interjected sharply, &#34;Don&#39;t insult our  guests. With that attitude, you&#39;re hardly fitting for our establishment. You&#39;re lowering our standards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She signaled to security. &#34;Please escort these troublemakers out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb moved protectively in front of Evelina, his gaze steely. &#34;I suggest you fetch your manager.Immediately.&#34; 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The security team paused, uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the receptionist insisted, &#34;And who might you be to demand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop,&#34; a commanding voice interrupted. The manager approached, his expression grave. &#34;Move away,&#34; he instructed his employee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina deftly retrieved her sleek Platinum membership card from her purse and presented it.&#34;We&#39;ll be dining in the Platinum Suite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, one moment please.&#34; The manager respectfully accepted the card and hurried off to confirm its validity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muttering quietly, the receptionist scoffed, &#34;That&#39;s definitely a counterfeit. She doesn&#39;t look like someone who could own a Platinum Card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme adopted a concerned expression. &#34;Ms. Marsh, this is Aglonard&#39;s top dining venue. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s out of your budget, but trying to pass off a fake card is quite inappropriate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As more crowd turned their attention towards the scene,Esme amplified her voice for the benefit of the restaurant manager. &#34;I apologize for any confusion caused. I&#39;m certain Ms. Marsh had no intention of causing a scene-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager returned, his face stricken with embarrassment, but not towards Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With utmost respect, he bowed slightly to Evelina.&#34;Ms. Marsh,please accept my apologies.Your Platinum Suite is prepared. Allow me to escort you and your guest personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s facade crumbled visibly, as if she had been struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Incredulity marked her features. How could Evelina,merely a housewife, an orphan, possess a Platinum Card?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb chuckled softly. &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve never actually seen a Platinum Card, Ms. Barton. No hard feelings though; you&#39;ll grow accustomed to finer settings in time.&#34; His words mirrored her own earlier condescension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s jaw was clenched so tightly that it seemed her   teeth might shatter. Her smile faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina casually flicked the card between her fingers and said sweetly, &#34;I&#39;m afraid you and Cary won&#39;t be joining us tonight. My friend might be tough, but even he can&#39;t digest a meal with a cheater and his mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Esme&#39;s forced smile finally fell away, her eyes began to brim with tears.&#34;Cary and I love each other     _1	1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina interrupted her sharply, &#34;Then you should probably urge him to finalize our divorce. You&#39;re not doing any favors to your so-called &#39;virtue&#39; by hanging onto a still-married man. Whatever good name you thought you had, you&#39;re shredding it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers swept through the onlookers. &#34;She&#39;s the mistress? Unbelievable.How shameful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re despicable!&#34; Esme burst into tears, covering her face as she rushed out, presumably to complain to Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina watched her go without a flicker of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist turned pale and approached hurriedly,stammering, &#34;Ms. Marsh-I-I had no idea you were Mrs.Gibson.Please forgive my error. I didn&#39;t intend-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perhaps it&#39;s best you find a different role,&#34; Evelina responded coldly, directing her gaze to the manager. &#34;If she&#39;s incapable of proper guest recognition,why is she even employed here? The person who recommended her should reconsider their position as well.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely, Ms. Marsh,&#34; the manager replied,nodding earnestly. His career was too important to jeopardize over a misjudgment.</p>
