                <p>&#34;Florrie, well done,&#34; Jasper said, affectionately patting his niece on the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, beaming with pride, replied, &#34;It&#39;s my responsibility to protect Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper mistook Evelina&#39;s cool demeanor for simple distress from her eye injury and the disturbances caused by Cary and his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly made a phone call. &#34;Seems like Cary has too much free time on his hands. Let&#39;s find him a distraction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, a string of misfortunes struck the Gibson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confronted with rising costs from suppliers and downward pressure on prices from clients, the company&#39;s finances were nearly breaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, harmful rumors began spreading internally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors that Cary was ungrateful and disloyal,embroiled in a nasty divorce, dominated the talk,damaging his reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the news went public, the Gibson Group&#39;s stock prices started to free fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his office, Cary asked, &#34;Who&#39;s behind these rumors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Esme setting out a homemade meal, he accused her impulsively, saying, &#34;Esme, was this your doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, interrupted while laying out the lunch,froze,her eyes filling with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really see me that way? Do you think I&#39;d cause problems now, of all times?&#34; she retorted,visibly upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, who was assisting, couldn&#39;t help but feel compassion for Esme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Margot had been released from detention due to Esme&#39;s intervention, she had become fiercely loyal to her, treating her almost like family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cary, have you forgotten already?&#34; Margot asked.&#34;Esme was the one who handed you fifty million when the company was struggling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot was right; her words rang with the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To secure her place within the Gibson family,Esme had not only saved Margot but had also drained her savings to pull Cary out of a financial mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on her sacrifices, Cary&#39;s rage cooled.&#34;Esme, I apologize. I&#39;ve been under a lot of pressure.It was wrong of me to snap at you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay.&#34; Esme simply nodded, her eyes downcast as she discreetly wiped away a tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Margot&#39;s sympathy deepened. &#34;Cary you&#39;ve got to see what you&#39;re doing to her. Out of al the people in the world, Esme is the one who truly loves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She comforted Esme with a gentle pat on the back before turning her anger towards Evelina. &#34;And it&#39;s clear who&#39;s spreading rumors about your divorce-it&#39;s Evelina! She&#39;s after your money. Do you really believe she&#39;d let you go without a fight? She&#39;s manipulating public perception to force you to show unity. Evelina&#39;s tactics are devious and desperate;she&#39;ll do anything to maintain her grip on the Gibson fortune!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing Margot&#39;s accusations, Cary could no longer contain himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed to confront Evelina directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, Evelina was scheduled to leave the hospital, and her discharge was a joyful occasion.Jasper and Florrie were organizing a welcome back celebration at Morningstar Villas, and Kristina had flown back from lreah to manage the formalities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, cherished by those around her, was about to step out of the hospital when Cary appeared, visibly furious. &#34;Evelina, what have you done to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated before launching another accusation.&#34;It was you, wasn&#39;t it? You hired that lawyer to file for divorce, and then you sabotaged the Gibson Group&#39;s stock price!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina emerged, fully recovered, the first thing she saw was Cary&#39;s enraged face, which immediately soured her mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cary Gibson, if your brain&#39;s messed up, go see a neurologist or get a rabies shot. Stop biting people every time you open your mouth!&#34; Kristina had been fed up with Cary for ages. Now she finally exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary retorted angrily, &#34;Who the hell are you calling a rabid dog?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s you I&#39;m talking about, you fool!&#34; Kristina responded, hands on her hips and full of disdain.&#34;Who else but you has been ungrateful after having their sight restored? Who else had an affair with their old flame while married, and now seeks a divorce to leave their spouse with nothing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s cheeks flushed with indignation, his posture  lacking any real confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, he stubbornly retorted, &#34;This is a private issue. It should not have been leaked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you even hear yourself? Evelina was injured and temporarily blinded. Do you think she had the energy or desire to gossip about your shameful history?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina jabbed a finger towards Cary. &#34;Who do you think you are? You&#39;re nothing but a shameful</p>
