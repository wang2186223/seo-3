                <p>The sight of a looming thundercloud typically instilled fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This feeling was heightened as a passenger&#39;s cry of despair echoed through the cabin, followed by a lightning strike hitting the plane&#39;s right side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the damage was minor, the aircraft swayed briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cabin erupted into chaos!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the best efforts of the purser and the flight attendants to restore order, passengers were overwhelmed with panic, pushing their way toward the cockpit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some pleaded to turn back, others demanded an immediate landing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A handful, clueless about flying, confronted the captain directly, seeking someone to blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One particularly desperate passenger even requested a parachute from the purser, intent on escaping the perceived doomed flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Infuriated, the purser said, &#34;Do you even know how to operate a parachute? Can you open it? The aircraft is under control. Please, take your seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The passenger was left speechless, realizing he had no knowledge of parachutes beyond movie scenes,where jumping from a troubled plane seemed customary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the chaos, Evelina remained calm, pressing her face against the window to study the thunderclouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Navigating through this intense cloud layer was challenging, yet not completely unfeasible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the chaos ensued, Jasper had already begun using his professional equipment to measure the cloud density and check the plane&#39;s status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper!&#34; Evelina abruptly pointed out an important finding. &#34;Look, there&#39;s an opening in the clouds.lt might be possible for us to go through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34; Jasper quickly identified the same opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was taken aback. His training in the military and access to advanced gear typically gave him an edge in such situations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Evelina had noticed it first with just her eyesight,despite the challenging conditions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, exactly there,&#34; Evelina answered, peering at the instrument readings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reviewing the data, she said, &#34;Sadly, the opening is quite narrow. It would require remarkable piloting skills to maneuver through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper agreed with a nod. &#34;True. I&#39;ve handled similar challenges before. It might not be too tough. I can help guide the pilot.&#34; Evelina was surprised to learn that Jasper was not only an expert marksman but also possessed piloting skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;I&#39;ve only ever been a co-pilot under my mentor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While her flying abilities were competent, she had never handled the controls alone under such grave conditions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, visibly impressed, complimented her.&#34;You know how to fly too, Evelina? That&#39;s remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He playfully tousled her hair and then stood, his expression earnest. &#34;Do you trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely!&#34; Evelina rose swiftly, her expression one of resolve. &#34;You&#39;ll manage to bring us down safely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would all make it out of this safely, including themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a confident nod and a smile, Jasper asked,&#34;After we land, might I ask you over to my place?&#34; &#34;I must. Florrie expects me,&#34; Evelina replied,attempting to muster a cheerful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s settled then.&#34; Jasper aimed to keep the goodbye light, not wanting it to sound too grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought lingered-what if? What if something catastrophic happened during the flight? He didn&#39;t want to have any regrets. Evelina needed to know his feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was perceptive; surely, she would understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s settled,&#34; Evelina replied, gripping Jasper&#39;s hand tightly in a gesture of solidarity, offering him both strength and support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, to Cary, who had just observed this exchange, it appeared as though Evelina was overtly flirting with Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had finally extricated himself from lan amidst the turmoiI, only to find Evelina apparently in a meeting with Jasper! Esme and Margot had earlier suggested there was something going on between them, but Cary had dismissed those claims.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had convinced himself that a man as distinguished as Jasper would never seriously consider Evelina, a woman who was already married.Cary thought Jasper&#39;s interest would be fleeting at best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here was Evelina, seemingly having won Jasper&#39;s heart by leveraging her medical expertise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, Cary shouted, &#34;Evelina, where is your decency? We&#39;re not even divorced, and you&#39;re already seeking a new partner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Control your words!&#34; Jasper retorted angrily. &#34;Or l might just throw you out of this plane myself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a flash of lightning momentarily lit up the sky, causing Cary&#39;s legs to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, the purser&#39;s announcement crackled through the speakers. &#34;We need medical assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our co-pilot has injured his arm and requires immediate care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically, even skilled professionals hesitate to step forward in such tense moments, fearing the repercussions of their involvement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless, Evelina boldly said, &#34;I&#39;m a doctor.Let me help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary tried to hold her back. &#34;Are you insane? What if they blame you-ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His protest was abruptly silenced as Jasper forcefully dislocated his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s agonized screams echoed through the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper gave him a severe warning, &#34;Evelina belongs to me. Stay away fromn her, or the consequences will be severe next time!&#34;</p>
