                <p>&#34;Why am I still breathing?&#34; Evelina&#39;s mouth curved into an unsettling smirk. &#34;Because I haven&#39;t finished eliminating all of you yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four kidnappers quaked, panic visible in their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security personnel from the Russell household arrived promptly, restraining the attackers with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper gave instructions for an in-depth investigation to identify their identities and the mastermind behind the ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, are you alright? Did you get hurt? I was really terrified...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora walked toward him, her steps elegant, voice coated in concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found her presence draining but kept his reaction subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given what she&#39;d just endured, she was understandably shaken. If she fainted again, he&#39;d be forced to deal with the aftermath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shot whizzed past Aurora&#39;s face, grazing her skin and striking the artwork behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood frozen, paralyzed with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The canvas clattered to the floor with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she snap out of it, turning her head in slow motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to murder me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stare-once full of pride and scorn-now flickered with genuine terror as it landed on Evelina. Oops, did I hurt you?&#34; Evelina cooed, her tone a perfect mockery of Aurora&#39;s usual sweetness. &#34;My bad,Miss Marsh.I thought this rifle was a replica. I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d actuallyfire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to be alarmed, she handed the weapon back to the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed a hand over her heart, feigning innocence. &#34;Goodness, that gave me a fright. Lucky no one got injured. I&#39;m sure a refined lady like you wouldn&#39;t hold a little accident against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then dashed to Jasper, playfully pouting. &#34;This sniper isn&#39;t any fun. Next time, teach me how to hit moving targets with a pistol instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her performance was so flawless, Jasper almost laughed. He patted her shoulder lightly and replied,&#34;Sure,whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora seethed quietly, furious with jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s aim had nearly ended her life-and she had the gall to pretend it was a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That insufferable woman was sending a message: come near Jasper again, and the next bullet will land between your eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jasper, who had seen everything, chose to ignore it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora, you&#39;ve had a rough night. You should lie down for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of protecting her, Jasper seemed eager to get rid of her and instructed the guards totake her back to her quarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aurora couldn&#39;t allow Evelina to tighten her grip on Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright. Let me stay and assist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper shut her down instantly. &#34;Evelina and I can handle this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He may as well have said she was irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora bit her lower lip, unwilling to back down. &#34;Mara&#39;s assigned to protect me. I need answers. Otherwise,how will I explain this to Grandmother?&#34; She dropped her grandmother&#39;s name, hoping it would earn some consideration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jasper remained unmoved. &#34;That&#39;s precisely why you shouldn&#39;t get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s expression crumpled, eyes glassy with unshed tears. &#34;Jasper...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond, and Evelina behaved as though she didn&#39;t even exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a guard returned holding a mask they&#39;d found in Mara&#39;s belongings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The material was identical to that worn by the assailants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Mara had taken a bullet, she was still alive and receiving medical care as a doctor had already come to treat her wound and put her on an IV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this yours?&#34; Evelina asked, lifting the mask to Mara&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clearly too large for her delicate features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made it that size on purpose. I wanted to aim big,&#34; Mara whispered hoarsely, justifying her choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eyes with Evelina, she asked, &#34;When did you start plotting this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plan had seemed airtight. So how had it fallen apart so completely?</p>
