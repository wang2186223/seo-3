                <p>Esme&#39;s composure shattered, revealing a brief surge of panic before she replied, &#34;You&#39;re just envious!Envious because Cary loves me instead of you! You&#39;re driving a wedge between us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly adopting the role of a sacrificial hero, she added with a sniffle, &#34;Alright! I&#39;ll leave. If my departure will save her, then that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s lingering doubts evaporated as he watched Esme&#39;s performance, his heart swelling with empathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t blame yourself, Esme.&#34; He reassured her softly,stepping in to protect her. &#34;You won&#39;t face this alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within,Esme gloated over her successful manipulation.Even if Evelina harbored suspicions about her role in inciting Margot, it mattered little. Cary&#39;s devotion was clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,she feigned concern,murmuring softly, &#34;But what will become of Margot? Evelina seems unyielding...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,fueled by a mix of concern and indignation,confronted Evelina sharply, saying, &#34;Don&#39;t you care about how this will affect my grandmother if you continue accusing Margot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina remained stoic, she retorted, &#34;If your grandmother knew the truth of Margot&#39;s actions,she&#39;d personally escort her to the police. She&#39;s no fool-unlike someone here, being manipulated by his mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury washed over Cary, his features tightening.&#34;What&#39;s your angle here? What are you after? Let&#39;s talk-everything but marriage is on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina retorted sharply, &#34;Oh, really? I&#39;ll take everything you own. Are you prepared to hand that over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s temper flared again. &#34;You&#39;re pushing your luck,Evelina. I&#39;m trying to remain civil.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold smile, Evelina set her terms. &#34;Tomorrow,8 a.m., the courthouse. Be there or Margot ends up behind bars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed her gaze directly on Cary. &#34;And don&#39;t think of asking Mr. Russell for favors. I was present during each of your eye surgeries. I know who the real Sight Weaver is-and it&#39;s definitely not Esme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme replied, desperation in her voice, &#34;You&#39;re lying!You&#39;re just a housewife, what do you know about any of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Caleb had already called the restaurant manager.Moments later, Cary and Esme were being escorted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had gone, the room fell quiet again. New dishes were served one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper offered Evelina some of the freshly served food, his voice soft but firm. &#34;You extended them mercy, and they responded with contempt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina exhaled deeply. &#34;Margot remains Demi&#39;s granddaughter,after all...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never truly intended to imprison Margot; her threat was more of a desperate attempt to instill fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she resolved, if the Gibson family targeted her once more, her patience would reach its end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, thought you were the type to strike fear in everyone&#39;s heart,&#34; Caleb said, a hint of annoyance in his tone. &#34;Shouldn&#39;t those jerks have been trembling at your presence? Next time, I&#39;m bringing the bodyguards my cousin insisted on. It would&#39;ve spared us their irritating presence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a composed demeanor, Jasper responded,&#34;Evelina sets her own plays. She signals when she wants my intervention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was silently impressed by Jasper&#39;s show of respect for her independence, a stark contrast to the notorious reputation that preceded him. Here was a man who understood limits and honored her space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb, never one to let a moment of banter slip by,asked, &#34;Getting familiar, are we? &#39;Evelina&#39; now-has she granted you that privilege?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper met his gaze steadily. &#34;You&#39;ve been calling me Jasper. Thought I&#39;d level the familiarity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interrupting Caleb&#39;s comeback, Evelina swiftly stuffed a chicken wing into his mouth. &#34;Focus on your meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then casually turned to Jasper. &#34;Join in, Jasper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evident Jasper didn&#39;t make exceptions often.Evelina wasn&#39;t about to let this unexpected openness fade.</p>
