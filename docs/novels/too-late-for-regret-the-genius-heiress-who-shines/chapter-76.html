                <p>&#34;Do you have any proof to back up your allegations,Ms.Marsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme would never confess to being the catalyst for the downturn in Gibson Group&#39;s stocks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had attempted to cast herself and Cary as long-lost lovers reunited, framing Evelina as the other woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the narrative spun out of her control,transforming Cary into an adulterer and Esme into a shameless mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was meant to unfold as a nostalgic romance spiraled into a scandal, sinking the company&#39;s shares even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme was perplexed about how her plan had so disastrously unraveled. Evelina, incensed, retorted sharply, &#34;I would like to ask you the same question. On what grounds do you accuse me? Just who do you think you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cautioned Esme, &#34;If you insist on playing the other woman, you should at least have the grace to remain unseen! Test my patience again, and I won&#39;t hold back from putting you in your place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harshness of Evelina&#39;s words cut deeper than any physical slap might have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, biting her lip and letting tears flow, was performing for Cary, hoping he might sympathize and defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s heart did twinge with sympathy for Esme,and he was nearly moved to intervene, but Kristina interrupted loudly, &#34;Really, Esme? Who&#39;s the audience for your tears? Didn&#39;t you initiate this confrontation? Evelina merely granted your wishes,so shouldn&#39;t you be grateful instead of upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina had long suppressed her revulsion for Esme,the unabashed home-wrecker. &#34;Remember this Evelina has scheduled your public apology at Landen&#39;s grave for next week. Be there on time and show some genuine remorse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s tears stopped abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately, she sought Cary&#39;s gaze, shaking her head vehemently. &#34;I can&#39;t face that...I just can&#39;t...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Already tarnished by scandal, her publc admission of impersonating the Sight Weaver would destroy her completely. The Gibson family could never embrace a daughter-in-law mired in such disgrace!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Esme, you&#39;re unbelievable,&#34; Kristina replied with evident scorn. &#34;You orchestrated the deceit,you accepted the bet-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; Cary interjected sharply, moving to Esme&#39;s side to protect her from further rebuke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grasping Cary tightly, Esme broke down, her sobs wracking her body as she sought refuge in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary, visibly annoyed, fixed Evelina with a harsh stare. &#34;She invoked your name only to assist others.Must you press her so hard?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded sharply, &#34;If I had lost the bet,would you have shown me any mercy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer was a resounding no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme and Margot would have taken full advantage of the situation to destroy her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, Miss Barton, what a pleasure to see you,&#34;lan said as he emerged from the car, opening the car door for the ladies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, observing from within the car the ongoing argument between Cary and Esme, had dispatched lan to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan spared no pleasantries for the deceitful pair,issuing a stern warning instead. &#34;As a representative of the Russell family, I witnessed the bet. I advise Miss Barton to fulfill her obligations, or face the Russell family&#39;s repercussions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implications were clear to all. With the Bartons&#39; modest ventures abroad, Jasper had the means to destroy them financially.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They risked not only bankruptcy but a perpetual burden of debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s energy seemed to vanish completely as she fell into Cary&#39;s embrace, struggling to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, nearing the car, cast one final glance at Esme, saying coldly, &#34;Expect a text with the exact time. Be punctual, Miss Barton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Esme collapsed completely to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary, in a desperate attempt, reached for Evelina as she entered the car, pleading, &#34;You&#39;re targeting Esme because of me... Evelina, we need to discuss this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away swiftly, all that remained was a cloud of exhaust in its wake.</p>
