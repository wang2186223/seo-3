                <p>Caleb has always been too talkative around Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had just left the main dining area when he couldn&#39;t hold back a chuckle. &#34;Evi, I was about to burst out laughing back there. Does that old schemer even know you&#39;ve got ownership here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was usually the epitome of chivalry, referring to every older woman as a &#34;lovely lady.&#34; That courtesy didn&#39;t extend to Esme Barton, though, who he deliberately described with an added &#34;old&#34; to emphasize his disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina simply nodded, aware of the many things Esme didn&#39;t know about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they arrived at the Platinum Suite, Caleb lingered by the door while Evelina walked in.He then whispered something to the restaurant manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager appeared uncomfortable. &#34;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s possible,sir...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb gave his shoulder a reassuring pat. &#34;Just do as l say,and I&#39;ll handle the fallout.&#34; As the manager reluctantly departed, Caleb entered the suite, a mischievous grin on his face, and moved to lock the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was trying to prevent Jasper from entering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina noticed. &#34;Caleb?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He coughed awkwardly and abandoned his scheme,opting to sit next to her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tousled his hair affectionately, a gesture from their childhood. &#34;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re too old to be playing these tricks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb couldn&#39;t help but smile broadly. &#34;No matter how old I get, I&#39;ll still be your little brother, Evi.&#34; ①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He harbored a wish to stay by Evelina&#39;s side forever,fearing the day someone might pull her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded with a tone of endearment yet assertion, &#34;Yes, you&#39;re my brother. The only one I&#39;ll ever have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That response silenced him effectively. &#34;Exactly what I needed to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from her seat, Evelina said, &#34;I&#39;m off to the restroom. Go ahead and order something light for us,will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Evelina left for the bathroom than Caleb pulled out his phone and dialed his cousin. &#34;Hey,Damien, quick thing-what&#39;s Jasper Russell&#39;s least favorite dish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently reconnected with his aunt Vivienne Marsh-Damien&#39;s mother-Caleb enjoyed the affection of the Marsh famnily, being the sole heir to Vivienne&#39;s maternal lineage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damien sounded puzzled by the inquiry. &#34;Jasper? He avoids spicy foods mostly.Why,you&#39;re dining with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his tone turned sharp. &#34;Listen, we Marshes aren&#39;t the type to back down-but even I wouldn&#39;t risk crossing Jasper Russell. That man&#39;s a storm waiting to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it were just his father they upset, maybe there would still be a way out. But messing with Jasper? That was a one-way road to nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Marsh and Russell families had long been at odds,though they maintained a show of civility in public. A direct clash between them wasn&#39;t considered worth the potential damage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, thanks, Damien,&#34; Caleb responded cheerily, ending the call. He then proceeded to fill their table with the spiciest food the menu offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the car, Jasper had just finished a phone conversation with Florrie when lan called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,concerning Caleb Quinn,&#34; lan said with caution.&#34;He presents a bit of a challenge. He&#39;s actually the long-lost nephew of Vivienne Marsh-yes,that Mrs.Marsh. For years, the Marsh family has been searching for their missing daughter, and Caleb is the only clue they have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, during a hospital visit, Vivienne and her sister-in-law each had a child with them. A fire erupted,ensuing chaos, and both children disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After many years, the Marsh family finally located Caleb and are now deploying all their resources to find the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan added, &#34;The family is extremely protective of him.They treat him like he&#39;s fragile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This explained Caleb&#39;s bold demeanor; he had powerful support behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper responded coldly, &#34;Then work out how to return him to the Marsh family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Jasper had no intention of causing Caleb harm,he preferred to keep him away from Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan paused,uncertain. &#34;Uh, sir... does this have to do with Ms. Marsh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Y</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three days,&#34; Jasper said bluntly. &#34;He goes back, or you&#39;re the one taking a flight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he disconnected the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan released a long, despairing groan.</p>
