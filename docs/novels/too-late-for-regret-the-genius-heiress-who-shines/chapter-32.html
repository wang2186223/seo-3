                <p>Evelina wasted no time in calling the Gibson family&#39;s butler to verify if Demi was truly unwell. Skipping lunch entirely, she prepared to head straight for the Gibson estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie made several attempts to stop her,but none succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Evelina reached the door,a voice rang out from behind. &#34;Evelina, where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s tone was composed, yet there was an unmistakable authority in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused momentarily. &#34;Demi isn&#39;t feeling well-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And neither are you!&#34; His words carried a mix of disapproval and concern. &#34;Your back injury hasn&#39;t fully healed,you just recovered from an illness, and you&#39;ve spent the whole morning taking care of me. Do you think you&#39;re unstoppable?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow creased slightly as he spoke in a firm voice.&#34;Sit down. Eat first. lan will take you there later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie grasped Evelina&#39;s hand. &#34;You better listen to  Uncle Jasper. He&#39;s terrifying when he&#39;s upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no alternative, Evelina returned to the table,where Jasper personally served her a bowl of soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aroma was inviting, but she had no appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Demi&#39;s condition were severe, her family would have taken her to a hospital by now. Since she&#39;s still at the estate, it&#39;s unlikely to be urgent. A short delay won&#39;t change much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s voice was steady as he placed more food onto her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat something first. If Demi sees you pale and exhausted, it&#39;ll only add to her stress, which could make her feel worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had to admit his reasoning made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she stared at the overwhelming portion before her,she looked exasperated. &#34;Jasper, this is way too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it&#39;s too much, share with me.&#34; Florrie pushed her bowl closer, pouting. &#34;Uncle Jasper only looks after you now. He doesn&#39;t even serve me food anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina felt embarrassed right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper scooped a spoonful of soup for his niece and  smirked. &#34;Even with your mouth full, you still find a way to chatter,huh?&#34;	7</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once lunch was over, Jasper stayed true to his word and had lan drive Evelina to the Gibson estate himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grew restless during the ride, and as soon as the car stopped, she hurried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, to her astonishment, the household staff blocked her path. &#34;Mrs. Gibson has made it clear-you are not welcome here. Leave now, or we&#39;ll have to throw you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina insisted they contact Asher, the butler. &#34;He&#39;ll let me in. I promise this won&#39;t cause trouble for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the servants merely sneered. &#34;Asher is busy tending to Mrs. Demi Gibson. No one has time for the likes of you, you wretched woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wretched woman? Evelina had no doubt Elora was behind this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her patience wearing thin, she narrowed her eyes and sneered, &#34;What did you just say? Care to repeat that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well said!&#34; A sharp, grating voice interrupted. Elora approached with a triumphant sneer. &#34;You had my daughter locked up, and now you dare show your face here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her arrival, the servants, who had been intimidated by Evelina&#39;s glare, instantly regained their confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina refused to lower herself to Elora&#39;s level. She kept her composure. &#34;I only came to check on Demi   1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora practically spat the words at her. &#34;Who do you think you are? You have no right to see her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands on her hips, she gave a commanding order.&#34;Bring a broom and chase her out! Let&#39;s see if she ever dares step foot here again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her signal, one of the servants lifted a broom and swung it at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Annoying,&#34; Evelina muttered, bracing herself to fight back. But before the broom could land, a swift kick sent the servant sprawling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did that? Who dares lay a hand on one of our household workers-&#34; Elora&#39;s outrage flared, but when her eyes landed on lan, her anger evaporated in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly shifted to a sickly sweet smile. &#34;Mr.Russell? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had no interest in dealing with the likes of the Gibson family, so lan was sent in his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard Demi was ill and came to visit. But it seems my presence isn&#39;t welcome,&#34; lan remarked coolly.&#34;Ms.Marsh,let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words left Elora dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head, she hurried to explain, &#34;N-no! Of course, you&#39;re always welcome here! We just don&#39;t want that troublemaker anywhere near us-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Gibson!&#34; lan&#39;s voice was sharp, cutting through her excuse. &#34;Ms. Marsh is a valued guest of the Russell family. Insulting her is the same as insulting us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cold gaze swept over Elora and the servants who had humiliated Evelina as he firmly demanded,&#34;Apologize!&#34;</p>
