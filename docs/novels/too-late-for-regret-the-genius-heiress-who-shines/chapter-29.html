                <p>Caleb was stubborn about not heading to a hotel after their dinner. Despite Evelina&#39;s logical arguments,he stood his ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing his patience, Jasper commanded, and two bodyguards immediately escorted a protesting Caleb to the car,mimicking a young child being taken to school.&#34;Evi, save me!&#34; Caleb dramatized his plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina,amused by his performance, complimented Jasper. &#34;Seems you&#39;ve got a way with handling him.It&#39;s about time someone put him in his place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging her with a subtle smile, Jasper gallantly held the car door open for her, and they both made their way back to Morningstar Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving late, they found Florrie had fallen asleep waiting for them. After ensuring she was comfortably asleep,they went to their respective rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, at precisely 7:30,while Evelina was finishing her breakfast, a distressed housemaid burst in.&#34;Ms. Marsh-urgent! Mr. Russell is very sick! Please,come quickly!&#34; she exclaimed, pulling Evelina towards Jasper&#39;s room. What&#39;s the matter with him?&#34; Evelina inquired as they hastened, but the maid could provide no specifics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was already outside Jasper&#39;s bedroom when she heard someone approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly cried out, &#34;Evi, come quick! Uncle&#39;s in a bad way. His stomach&#39;s pretty delicate, and it looks like he had something off last night. He got a fever after midnight, hasn&#39;t said much since, and it looks serious. His fever is high, but he can&#39;t take most medicines because he&#39;s allergic. We&#39;ve tried non-medical ways to cool him down, but they&#39;re not doing the trick...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Florrie. I&#39;m on it.&#34; Evelina assured her and proceeded to speak with the family doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His condition is probably due to his dietary restrictions,&#34; explained the doctor. &#34;Spicy or heavily seasoned foods don&#39;t agree with Mr. Russell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A realization dawned on Evelina, her spirits dampening.The spicy meal Caleb playfully ordered the previous evening was to blame. She knew Jasper wasn&#39;t fond of spicy food, but she hadn&#39;t understood the severity of his allergy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After assessing Jasper herself and consulting with the doctor, Evelina understood the gravity of his fever. The doctor hurriedly enumerated all the treatments and cooling methods she had applied, concerned that she might have overlooked something critical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded, &#34;You&#39;ve implemented a solid strategy, which I would have chosen myself under these circumstances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over the doctor as she released a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina continued with a thoughtful look, focusing on Jasper&#39;s feverish form. &#34;However, we may need to consider a more radical approach given the severity of his condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suggested her plan with a steady voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing the details, the doctor quickly dismissed the idea. &#34;Ms. Marsh, ths method is unknown to me. It carries too much risk. Should something go wrong with Mr. Russell...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, unsettled by the doctor&#39;s resolute stance,asked her friend, &#34;Evi, are you certain this is the right path?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had her doubts. She wasn&#39;t completely sure.Yet, she was aware that without intervention, his condition could cause lasting harm. Drawing in a deep breath, she said, &#34;Should any harm come to him, I wvill accept all responsibility. Moreover if he suffers permanent damage, I will dedicate my life to his care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to an assistant nearby and instructed,&#34;Fetch me ice and the strongest alcohol available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced by the urgency, Florrie agreed. &#34;I believe in Evi. Let&#39;s do what we can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching the bedside, Evelina started to undo Jasper&#39;s shirt buttons. &#34;Begin by taking off his shirt and pants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, Florrie said, &#34;Wait... everything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina unfastened the third button, the silky fabric of the pajama top fell open, revealing Jasper&#39;s well-defined collarbone and the sculpted contours of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight tremor touched Evelina&#39;s hands as she remembered Kristina&#39;s remarks about Jasper&#39;s dangerous allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regaining her composure, she called two male bodyguards. &#34;Ensure his arms and hands are wiped with ice. Then, dab alcohol on his chest, back, and limbs.Continue every hour until his fever subsides.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards&#39; rough handling caused Jasper,who was semi-conscious, to moan in discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, Evelina decided to take over the task herself.</p>
