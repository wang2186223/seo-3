                <p>Aurora clenched her teeth, feeling resentment flood through her. Outsiders might think she lived a charmed life as a respected daughter of the prestigious Marsh family from lreah, but the reality was quite different. Franklin, Vivienne, and their sons had never fully accepted her because she wasn&#39;t their biological child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was forever overshadowed by the memory of Jazmine, always seen as just the adopted daughter who belonged on the fringes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite enduring numerous slights within the family silently, Aurora&#39;s only true desire was to be with Jasper, a hope not supported by her adoptive family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by a deep-seated bitterness, she remembered Ady&#39;s advice to maintain patience and composure. At the moment, her best strategy was to conform to the role of the compliant daughter, so she quickly agreed with Franklin, &#34;Alright, Dad, I&#39;ll listen to your advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having recently caused a significant stir, it was crucial for her to now adopt the guise of a well-behaved daughter. &#34;I realize that you and Mom want only the best for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear,&#34; Franklin said, feeling reassured of her sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Soon, I&#39;ll take the assistant&#39;s remains back to lreah so her sister can have a final farewell. Also, howis Mom feeling these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Aurora&#39;s question about Vivienne suggested concern,she actually shared Ady&#39;s aversion towards her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivienne&#39;s continual mourning over her lost daughter and resulting illnesses were a burden Aurora wished the family could finally shed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She had a tough time again,&#34; Franklin explained with a heavy heart. &#34;When you return, bring Caleb. He seems to calmn her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was two hours later when Evelina regained consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea was there to check up on her upon waking and, relieved to see Evelina well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling much better, Evelina urged Dorothea-who&#39;d been running around all day-to head home and get some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Dorothea had left, only Florrie remained in the room with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My uncle and lan had to step out, and Mr. Quinn was urgently called-apparently, Mrs. Marsh is having a tough time,&#34; Florrie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held Evelina&#39;s hand softly, offering solace. &#34;I just spoke with my uncle; he&#39;ll be here shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks so much, Florrie,&#34; Evelina responded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s the least I can do for you,&#34; Florrie replied warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they continued talking, Florrie unintentionally revealed more. &#34;You know, Mrs. Ady Marsh was apparently worried you might be a rival for my uncle&#39;s affections, prompting her to use Aurora&#39;s assistant for her schemes. My uncle uncovered all the proof, leaving the Marsh family speechless.Aurora even came by to apologize for her grandmother while you were asleep. I didn&#39;t want to disturb you, so l asked her to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening in silence, Evelina absorbed the information, her thoughts racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady had never even seen her face to face. Why was she so intent on smoothing Aurora&#39;s way? Evelina remained convinced that it was Aurora who had instructed her assistant to take those actions, not Ady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fret, Evelina. My uncle has got your back-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s assurance was cut off by the buzz of her  phone. She picked up immediately upon seeing Franklin&#39;s name flash across the screen. &#34;Hello? Mr.Marsh, what can I do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused to listen, then turned to Evelina, muffling the phone with her hand. &#34;Evelina, it&#39;s Aurora&#39;s father. He wishes to speak with you. Should I hand over the phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let him speak,&#34; Evelina responded, her curiosity piqued about the Marsh family&#39;s intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would they demand she keep her distance from Jasper, or were they calling to confront her on behalf of Ady and Aurora?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; Florrie sympathized with Evelina&#39;s inability to see, so she activated the speakerphone and set it beside the latter&#39;s pillow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this Ms. Marsh?&#34; Franklin&#39;s tone came through the speaker, surprisingly gentle for someone known as a formidable figure in lreah, sounding instead like a considerate neighbor. Evelina was taken aback, but she kept her composure. &#34;Hello, Mr. Marsh. This is Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I deeply regret this whole situation. The incident was a failing on our part, and I am profoundly sorry for the distress it caused you. I assure you, measures will be taken to prevent such incidents in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was amazed to hear such a heartfet apology coming directly from Franklin, whom she knew to be both stern and calculating despite his usual polite demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Marsh, I would like to make amends for the trouble we&#39;ve caused you. Please let me know what you need, and I&#39;ll endeavor to meet your demands,&#34;Franklin said earnestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina felt a flicker of respect for Franklin&#39;s approach but remained cautious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked, &#34;And if my request is to take legal action against the perpetrator, would you support that decision,Mr.Marsh?&#34;</p>
