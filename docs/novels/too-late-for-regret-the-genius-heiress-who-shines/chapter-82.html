                <p>Evelina looked at Cary. A mocking scoff slipped out as the pieces suddenly fell intoplace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long before, Kristina had called to mention she&#39;d be delayed on the next flight, which had left Evelina wondering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Cary sitting where Kristina should have been,the truth wasn&#39;t hard to conclude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surprised? To me, it&#39;s simply fate,&#34; Cary replied,radiating a confidence that suggested she should be delighted by his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never made such an effort for Esme; Evelina was the first. He thought she would surely be moved by his dedication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, this is the sort of feeble attempt you think impresses people?&#34; Evelina gave him a look filled with derision and then proceeded to seek a seat change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,who had been lounging carelessly in his seat without offering any help with her luggage, abruptly stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught Evelina&#39;s wrist firmly. &#34;You&#39;re supposed to sit here. Where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t concern you,&#34; Evelina retorted, attempting to wrest her wrist from his grasp, but Cary only tightened his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t our marriage make it my business?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of disapproval circulated among the passengers as they witnessed what seemed to be a domestic dispute-clearly not suitable for the confined space of the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, however, was unfazed by the bystanders.If she was to make a scene, she intended for it to be unforgettable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So now I&#39;m your wife?&#34; she asked, her voice cutting like a knife. &#34;Where was this loyalty when you were with your mistress? Or when you slapped that divorce paper in front of me, trying to leave me penniless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice escalated with her resentment. &#34;Suddenly,because you think I have some influence with Mr.Russell, we&#39;re married again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then forcefully stomped on Cary&#39;s foot and twisted her heel deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary hunched over, wincing in agony, yet his grasp didn&#39;t falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as our divorce isn&#39;t finalized, you are still my wife!&#34; he responded; determined to maintain his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina swore quietly. Could this bastard really intend to stickto her like a parasite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she prepared to escalate the conflict, a calm voice from behind her intervened-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gibson, if your aim is to discuss an investment with my employer, harassing Ms. Marsh isn&#39;t necessary. Please, deal with me,&#34; lan said, stepping in smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan gave Evelina a reassuring nod, then quickly moved to intercept Cary, forcefully twisting his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary let out a sharp yelp of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without paying him any further attention, lan pushed Cary firmly back into his seat before turning to Evelina. &#34;My seat is right behind yours. Feel free to use it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Evelina responded promptly, eager to distance herself from Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she moved towards lan&#39;s row, a tall man rose in front of her and smoothly relieved her of her carry-on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina looked up in surprise. &#34;Jasper? Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Jasper remained in Ireah after his last trip there with Florrie, thinking only lan had been traveling between the cities. &#34;Aren&#39;t you glad to see me?&#34; Jasper inquired as he stowed her bag overhead and motioned towards the window seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s just... unexpected.&#34; Evelina felt unexpectedly vulnerable, as if he could read her every thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the seat next to hers, then faced her, his voice low and earnest. &#34;What if I said I came specifically to pick you up...would that please you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper hadn&#39;t seen Evelina for over a week. He thought he would be fine, yet the longer she was away, the deeper his longing grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was taken aback by how much he missed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina chose not to respond directly to his statement. Instead, she chuckled lightly. &#34;I suppose Florrie sent you after me, didn&#39;t she? She&#39;s always so thoughtful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was my own choice,&#34; Jasper responded softly.&#34;She didn&#39;t ask me.&#34; Evelina was momentarily at a loss for words,surprised by his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their awkward pause was fortunately interrupted by a flight attendant arriving to take their orders, giving them a brief spare from their conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the plane took off, Evelina requested a blanket and a sleep mask, promptly tilting her seat back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding conversation was her way to sidestep potential discomfort, and truthfully, she felt exhausted. Soon, she fell into a deep sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slumber was abruptly disturbed by a sudden lurch of the aircraft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, wake up. We&#39;ve encountered some turbulence,&#34; Jasper said, concern evident in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaken,Evelina found herself upright, with Jasper having adjusted her seat for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purser&#39;s voice came over the cabin speakers- steady and composed-assuring everyone it was just turbulence, nothing to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded passengers to stay seated,keep their seat belts fastened, and remain calm as the plane moved through the rough patch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, a passenger peering out the window shouted in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t just turbulence-it&#39;s a thunderstorm!We&#39;re heading right into a storm! This is the end for us!&#34; they exclaimed, their voice filled with panic.</p>
