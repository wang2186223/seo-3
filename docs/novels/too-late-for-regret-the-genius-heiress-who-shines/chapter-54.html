                <p>&#34;Hold on-he&#39;s actually Jasper Russell?&#34; Cary exclaimed, completely stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Cary could even grasp the situation, the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards coldly brushed him aside.Moments later, the car door shut decisively, and the vehicle swiftly departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Motionless, Cary stared after Evelina&#39;s retreating figure, a strange sense of loss gnawing at his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unsettling feeling washed over him, as though something incredibly precious had slipped through his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary stormed back into Gibson Mansion, his frustration bubbling as he approached Demi urgently.&#34;Have you known all along it was Evelina who restored my vision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi continued trimming her flowers, not even lifting her head. &#34;You&#39;re only realizing this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary stared. His grandmother had deliberately hidden it from him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why keep me in the dark?&#34; Cary asked, humiliation evident in his tone.&#34;Do you realize how embarrassing today was? You made me look foolish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I&#39;ve tried telling you countless times, but did you ever listen?&#34; Demi accidentally clipped off a blooming flower, tossing her scissors aside with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s righteous anger quickly diminished, replaced by defensiveness.&#34;When exactly did you mention it?I never heard anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During every surgery you underwent, I explicitly or subtly told you-without Evelina, your sight wouldn&#39;t have returned,&#34; Demi retorted bitterly. &#34;Yet,you never respected Evelina. Either you dismissed mny words or sided with your mother and sister in tormenting her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each passing sentence, Demi&#39;s disappointment deepened. &#34;Evelina tolerated you all gracefully for three years. If I were her, your sight would still be gone. Cary, Evelina owes our family nothing-we owe her an apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary lapsed into troubled silence, unconvinced by his grandmother&#39;s sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi sighed deeply, frustration clear. &#34;Let me reveal another truth-Margot returns tomorrow. Evelina intended only to teach her a small lesson, never truly harming her. Evelina&#39;s heart is gentle; she simply didn&#39;t want me worrying endlessly about my grandchildren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cary remained skeptical. &#34;Then why did she rip apart the forgiveness letter right in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi bristled angrily. &#34;It was merely an act! Evelina has never once broken her promise to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earnestly, she continued, &#34;Haven&#39;t you finally recognized Esme&#39;s true colors today? Without Evelina&#39;s protection, Esme would&#39;ve brought down the entire Gibson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary tried weaklyto defend Esme. &#34;Perhaps she had reasons-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What reasons?&#34; Demi slammed the table in anger.1fyou still consider yourself my grandson, cut ties with Esme immediately and reconcile with Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief second, Cary hesitated, his heart fluttering with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then an image of Evelina and Jasper together flashed through his mind, unsettling him deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman he&#39;d once belittled had quickly found someone superior, openly parading their closeness. He didn&#39;t want a woman like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s just ambitious! She&#39;s not nearly as wonderful as you claim,&#34; Cary stubbornly said, deeply disappointing Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi dismissed Cary with irritation, refusing even the courtesy of offering water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated and unsettled, Cary aimlessly climbed into his car, driving off without any clear destination in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed repeatedly-Esme&#39;s relentless calls-but he ignored each attempt to reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Cary shut off his phone entirely, refusing all further interruptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital, Esme panicked, abandoned by Elora after the beating, with Sebastian her sole remaining supporter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sebastian, Cary won&#39;t answer. He always picked up immediately before. Is he leaving me for Evelina?&#34; she cried in distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34; Sebastian growled angrily.&#34;After what his family did, they&#39;re not getting off lightly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly added, &#34;If Cary backs out, sue his mother for assault and get her locked up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Esme, completely distraught, ignored his advice, sobbing uncontrollably. &#34;Without Cary&#39;s protection now, I&#39;ll never survive the Russell family&#39;s wrath...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T&#39;ll deal with the Russell family for you,&#34; said a confident voice as a tall, captivating &#39;figure emerged suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; Esme and Sebastian exclaimed simultaneously, their guard instantly raised. &#34;Who exactly are you?&#34;</p>
