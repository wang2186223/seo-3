                <p>Cary had left home early-before 7:30-to steer clear of the congested streets. Waking up at this hour wasn&#39;t routine for him, and the exhaustion clung to him like a fog. By the time he made it to the courthouse,the clock read 7:50.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme had accompanied him, offering quiet reassurances as they lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the minutes stretched into hours, and 9 a.m.came and went, Evelina was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, Cary dialed her number repeatedly. His fingers burned against the heated surface of his phone,but she never answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe something urgent came up,&#34; Esme murmured,feigning sympathy while stirring his frustration. &#34;|doubt she did this on purpose-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Urgent? What could possibly be so pressing? She stays home all day!&#34; Cary snapped, hurling his phone onto the pavement. &#34;She&#39;s stalling. She never wanted this divorce in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme flinched at his outburst, instinctively stepping back. But when he didn&#39;t acknowledge her reaction-let alone soothe her-she swallowed her irritation and resumed her placating role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get worked up, Cary. Maybe... maybe this is just her true nature. You saw her last night-two men,a private VIP lounge? Looks like she&#39;s already scouting for her next option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More fuel on the fire. Then came the real suggestion.&#34;Why not let a lawyer take care of this? Cut out the headache entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d overheard from Cary&#39;s mother that Evelina had already secured a hefty sum and an apartment in the settlement. But Esme knew that land was in a redevelopment zone-just the sale could rake in a fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Altogether? Nearly eight million. There was no way she&#39;d let Evelina walk away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Legal route might be smoother,&#34; Cary muttered, jaw tight. &#34;But what about Margot? The only reason l agreed to this was to get her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave that to me,&#34; Esme assured him, slipping her arm through his. &#34;My brother&#39;s back in town. He has all the right connections. With his help, there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t get Margot released.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Evelina finally returned his call, Esme was already at the airport, welcoming her older brother,Sebastian Barton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding Cary&#39;s phone switched off, Evelina assumed he was with Esme and rang her instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, she&#39;d missed their 8 a.m. meeting-for valid reasons-but it was still on her. She had been prepared to apologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme didn&#39;t give her the opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the third attempt, she finally picked up, venom laced in her voice. &#34;You&#39;ve got some nerve calling me!Do you think your pathetic little tricks will stop this divorce? Wake up, Evelina. He&#39;s disgusted with you.He wants nothing to do with you. If you have any sense,you&#39;ll back off from Margot&#39;s case too. Demi&#39;s condition has worsened-because of you. Do you really want to be the reason she ends up in a hospital bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina dismissed Esme&#39;s words as the trash they were.Her tone turned glacial. &#34;Put Cary on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme hadn&#39;t expected such composure-it felt like swinging at air. &#34;Keep dreaming. He&#39;s never speaking to you again. You made his grandmother sick. He despises you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she ended the call and blocked Evelina&#39;s number. She turned to her brother. &#34;Think that&#39;ll do it? Will that woman finally let Margot go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word she had just spat-on speakerphone-was carefully scripted by Sebastian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did some digging,&#34; he said. &#34;She&#39;s just an orphan,raised on idealistic notions of loyalty and gratitude.Cary&#39;s grandmother was kind to her-she won&#39;t stomach the idea of that old woman suffering because of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly,&#34; Esme smirked. &#34;Girls like her... give them a shred of kindness, and they&#39;ll sacrifice everything.Pathetic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian chuckled. &#34;Not everyone is as sharp as you,dear sister. Still, a stroke of luck that the old lady&#39;s health took a dip...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme scoffed. &#34;Don&#39;t remind me. If that crone hadn&#39;t fallen ill, Cary wouldn&#39;t have rushed back. He was supposed to pick you up with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter...&#34; Sebastian waved it off. &#34;What matters is Evelina caves. Once she does, Cary will think we orchestrated everything. He&#39;ll be grateful.He&#39;ll trust you even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Esme&#39;s lips curl-a slow, calculated grin.&#34;You&#39;re a genius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Demi had caught nothing more than a mild seasonal illness. It had nothing to do with Margot&#39;s predicament.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Evelina didn&#39;t know that. And she cared too much about that old woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as she bought the lie, she&#39;d break. She&#39;d secure Margot&#39;s release. And when she did, Cary and his mother would be elated-convinced the Barton siblings had saved the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which meant, soon enough, Esme would officially become Mrs. Gibson.</p>
