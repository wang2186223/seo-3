                <p>After the airport encounter, Caleb made no effort to hide his intentions and squeezed himself into the backseat with Evelina and Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride was awkward, with Evelina feeling like a barrier between two imposing figures</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s gaze toward Caleb was cold and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite maintaining a stoic exterior, Caleb was inwardly cursing. The strength of Jasper&#39;s handshake had almost necessitated a trip to the hospital-if he hadn&#39;t let go at the last second, Caleb was certain he would have needed a cast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Caleb&#39;s resolve remained unshaken. He confidently said, &#34;I&#39;m staying wherever Evi stays. We come as a duo.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly dismissed the notion. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. Ms. Marsh will be staying at my residence,with my niece. Your presence there would be... less than ideal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward and quietly instructed the driver,&#34;Please take Mr. Quinn to the hotel.&#34; The declaration ignited Caleb&#39;s temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to let Evelina stay at Jasper&#39;s house without him, he insisted, &#34;Evi, you should come with me to the hotel tonight,&#34; while shooting Jasper a challenging look. 3</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb wasn&#39;t intimidated by Jasper Russell; after all,he worked for Damien Marsh, who was among the few capable of standing up to Jasper in Ireah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, Caleb&#39;s hidden connection as the long-lost nephew of Vivienne Marsh, Damien&#39;s mother,made him Damien&#39;s blood cousin.  Jasper&#39;s dismissive snort filled the car. &#34;Ms. Marsh has committed to helping my niece. Please, don&#39;t complicate things for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb retorted, &#34;Oh, your niece? Evelina and I have a decade&#39;s history. You just met her, what, last week?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Evelina, Caleb employed his most persuasive tone. &#34;Evi, seriously? After I&#39;ve come all this way? Are you going to leave me alone in some hotel? I&#39;m fragile, remember? Imagine if I fall ill again -you&#39;d feel terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina grimaced as Caleb dialed up his charm to maximum, his voice almost whiny now, leaving her defenseless against his pleas. Her respite came in the form of a phone call from Cary. Answering the call with one hand, she used the other to press Caleb&#39;s lips together, silencing his theatrical complaints.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper couldn&#39;t help but notice Caleb making a ridiculous face, his lips twitching with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s voice burst through the phone line, full of outrage. &#34;Evelina! Why are you only picking up now?Did you know Margot&#39;s been arrested?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity of his words was clear even without speakerphone, and both men beside her caught every detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know Margot orchestrated a kidnapping against me,right? She wanted me dead. And you&#39;re wondering why she&#39;s arrested?&#34; Evelina&#39;s response was cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary retorted, &#34;You&#39;re making that up! Margot wouldn&#39;t hurt anyone! You must be trying to trap her to squeeze something out of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His accusations were swift and harsh. &#34;My mom always said you were no good. You&#39;re just proving her point!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina retorted sharply,&#34;Oh, I&#39;m the one avoiding divorce? We were supposed to finalize everything yesterday morning. Who didn&#39;t show?&#34; Cary faltered briefly. &#34;Esme was ill, I couldn&#39;t just leave her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina scoffed, &#34;That&#39;s rich, considering | was attacked with a steel pipe and ended up in the hospital. Let&#39;s revisit this conversation about your saintly sister after I&#39;m out of the hospital, shall we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina quickly ended the call and switched off her phone,cutting off any furtherdiscussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb was seething. &#34;How can he be so entitled?Holding his sister longer might make him see sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right,&#34; Evelina replied, unfazed. &#34;He needs a little more time to understand the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grrrrr-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a growl interrupted their conversation-not from Caleb, but his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suggested they head to his hotel for a meal, but Jasper wanted Evelina back at the villa for dinner with Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the men nearly started arguing, Evelina intervened and chose a local eatery known for its specialties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina and Caleb entered the restaurant first to get a table, while Jasper remained outside, consoling an  angry Florrie over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, Florrie couldn&#39;t believe they had left to dine without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon approaching the host stand, they were met with a cold reception. &#34;I apologize,but we are fully booked for the evening,&#34; the receptionist said, maintaining a forced smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina,undeterred, inquired, &#34;Isn&#39;t there a VIP lounge available for platinum members?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Evelina could show her membership card, a familiar voice came from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina Marsh, trying to dine without a reservation?That&#39;s a bit embarrassing,&#34; Esme said,her voice laced with sarcasm. &#34;But don&#39;t worry, you can join us if you&#39;d like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smirk widened as she continued, &#34;Cary secured the best private suite for us tonight-the Gold Suite.Perhaps it&#39;s new to you? Just so you know, it has a starting minimum of a hundred thousand.&#34;</p>
