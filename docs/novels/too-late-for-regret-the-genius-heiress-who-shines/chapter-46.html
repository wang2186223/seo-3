            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s fist tightened unseen within the folds of her sleeve, her nails inadvertently piercing her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was acutely aware of Jasper&#39;s implications. Previously, she had declared herself his fiancee without his protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,why this sudden concern for misunderstandings?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it Evelina he was protecting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Aurora&#39;s disdain for Evelina intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,she quietly wiped away her tears and agreed with a nod. &#34;I&#39;ll respect your decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper merely grunted, his indifference clear; this was the correct course of action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa&#39;s butler, sensing tension, attempted to mitigate the situation. &#34;Mr. Russell has arranged for Ms.Aurora Marsh to stay at a nearby hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attempt to lighten the mood backfired, drawing a sharp glance from Jasper. &#34;Enough,&#34; Jasper scolded softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler withdrew to the kitchen, his presence no longer required in the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, troubled by the arrangement, wondered why a nearby hotel would feel so distant compared to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s favoritism towards Evelina baffled her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time for dinner, Evelina remained in her bath in the guest room, absent from the dinner table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora thought that Evelina had realized her place and chosen not to join them at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She prepared some of her best recipes herself. Florrie couldn&#39;t help but compliment, saying, &#34;Aurora, your cooking is amazing. The person who ends up with you is lucky indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleased by the compliment, Aurora cheerfully dished out more food for Florrie and Jasper. &#34;If you enjoy it,I&#39;m happy to cook like this every day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cooking daily? That&#39;s a role typically reserved for someone in the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regretting her earlier enthusiasm, Florrie quickly declined. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t have to cook every day, Aurora.Someone with your gifts should be doing much more significant things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This made Aurora even more delighted. &#34;Making money doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t enjoy cooking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To dodge further complications, Florrie concentrated on her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing quickly, Jasper said, &#34;I&#39;m done. Enjoy the rest of your meal.&#34; He had been quiet throughout dinner and seemed eager to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you eating much, Jasper? Is something wrong?&#34; Aurora asked, looking concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to join a video conference,&#34; Jasper replied curtly, headed straight to the study, eager to escape Aurora&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Evelina was around, it was completely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper found it hard not to smile when he watched Evelina eat, her cheeks stuffed, reminding him of a chipmunk, which always improved his own appetite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie, was it wrong of me to come? Jasper seems so distant when he sees me,&#34; Aurora said aloud, her voice tinged with sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could that be? Aurora, don&#39;t think like that. Uncle Jasper is probably just preoccupied with my upcoming surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora had once given a kidney to help her adoptive grandmother, compromising her own health, and Florrie hated seeing her distressed. She searched for the right words to ease Aurora&#39;s worries. &#34;I&#39;ll prepare some of Jasper&#39;s favorite treats tomorrow, maybe that will brighten his mood,&#34; Aurora responded,regaining her composure as she continued to dine with Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, even as the butler eventually escorted Aurora to her hotel, Jasper did not return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, do you really have such a low opinion of me now? You weren&#39;t always like this,&#34; she murmured to herself, puzzled by his change of attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora glared at the study&#39;s glowing window, her thoughts souring as she considered Evelina the root of all her troubles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was convinced Evelina was bewitching Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the solitude of her hotel room, she urgently made a call, saying, &#34;Dig up everything you can on Evelina!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, no one else was worthy of being at Jasper&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Evelina, fueled by a burst of creativity during her bath, hardly touched her dinner, too excited to begin sketching her new jewelry design, the Angel&#39;s Eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having completed a preliminary sketch, her hunger finally caught up with her, prompting her to head to the kitchen. Upon entering, she was greeted by the delicious smell wafting through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kitchen prepared a special snack for Mr. Russell since he worked late,&#34; the butler said as Evelina entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out Jasper had a specially prepared late-night snack waiting for him. Evelina realized there wasn&#39;t much to spare and felt a bit dejected, reaching for&#39;a pack of crackers instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could open it, Jasper intervened, taking the crackers from her hand, &#34;Those aren&#39;t very filling.Join me for some proper food instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his usual avoidance of late-night meals to keep fit, Jasper had ensured that there were dishes prepared for Evelina, especially since she hadn&#39;t eaten much of her dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Won&#39;t we run short, Jasper?&#34; Evelina asked, just as a servant appeared, laden with dishes that soon covered half the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will this suffice?&#34; Jasper asked, smiling at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The table was now overflowing with food, far more than they could possibly eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s enjoyment of the meal seemed to inspire Jasper&#39;s appetite, and he found himself eating more than he planned.</p>
