                <p>As darkness enveloped Aglonard, the city pulsed vibrantly under the glow of neon lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling up sharply in front of the dazzling Dusk Lounge,Kristina flashed Evelina a triumphant grin. &#34;Your Majesty, we&#39;ve arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping onto the bustling sidewalk, Evelina raised an eyebrow skeptically. &#34;I thought we were scouting talent tonight. What&#39;s with the infamous venue choice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just any nightclub-Dusk Lounge was the hottest, most notorious destination in the city,notably a favorite haunt of Cary&#39;s after his eyesight had been restored,mainly to avoid returning home to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly where I scout my fresh faces,&#34; Kristina replied breezily, looping Evelina&#39;s arm firmly with her own and pulling her through the vibrant entrance. &#34;I&#39;ve devised a fun little game tonight, and you&#39;re gonna adore it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Evelina&#39;s skeptical look, Kristina insisted enthusiastically, &#34;Don&#39;t even think about ditching me.Last time I promised you a divorce celebration, you chose sleep instead. You&#39;ve rested enough after your ordeal with the Gibsons-now we celebrate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing a lavish bundle of bright red roses from the reception counter, Kristina quickly deposited them into Evelina&#39;s confused arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina blinked, baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous smile, Kristina explained, &#34;I&#39;ve got a hundred fresh candidates performing tonight. Like someone? Toss him a rose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, Kristina continued, &#34;The others get just one pink rose each-you have ten bright red ones. Whoever catches your eye tonight receives top -tier management and resources.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina stared incredulously. &#34;Ahundred men to judge?Are you running a beauty contest or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughing delightedly, Kristina twirled and opened her arms grandly. &#34;The perks of royalty!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina sighed deeply, pressing her fingers to her temples, reconsidering the comfort of her bed back at the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relentlessly determined, Kristina practically dragged Evelina into the club&#39;s VIP section-an exclusive front -row seat with an unrivaled view of the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour passed, then the club exploded into dazzling lights, booming music, and a glittering shower of confetti.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men streamed onto the stage, performing in groups of ten, as wild screams filled the venue. &#34;He&#39;s amazing!I&#39;m in love!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Evelina remained indifferent, barely lifting her gaze from her drink, clearly uninterested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina was visibly distressed. &#34;I brought you here to unwind, not take vows of celibacy! A hundred men and you&#39;re unmoved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a little woozy from her drink, Evelina made her escape attempt. &#34;Let me freshen up. Be right back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget your roses!&#34; Kristina protested, thrusting the bouquet firmly back into Evelina&#39;s hands. &#34;You&#39;re not leaving until every rose finds a recipient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessly smiling, Evelina wandered toward the restroom with roses in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She emerged from the bathroom feeling clearer-only to run directly into Cary and Margot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot immediately wore a look of disgusted accusation. &#34;See that, Cary? I told you she&#39;s shameless-look how she&#39;s dressed, desperate for attention!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot swiftly pulled out her phone, snapping a quick series of photos capturing Evelina&#39;s appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasted no time, immediately forwarding them to Hayden with a message, saying, &#34;That&#39;s your target. No need to hold back-she&#39;s just an orphan. No one will miss her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of disgust surged through Cary as he scowled at Evelina, his voice dripping with disdain. &#34;Is this really how low you&#39;ve sunk? Coming here dressed like that -do you have no shame at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight, Evelina was worlds apart from her usual reserved elegance. Tonight, she was electrifying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vivid red lips and glossy, slightly hazy eyes,paired with the daringly cropped denim outfit, exuded an intoxicating confidence-bold, fierce, and irresistibly captivating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any man in his right mind would have been mesmerized instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiled over within Cary. The woman he&#39;d always dismissed as bland now radiated allure. Worse still-he found himself irresistibly drawn to her, making Esme&#39;s demure elegance suddenly appear dull by comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina returned his gaze, unfazed. &#34;We&#39;re no longer married, Cary-remember? You have no right to comment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering her roses confidently, Evelina began to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the vibrant crimson bouquet seemed to ignite something possessive within Cary. Grabbing her wrist,he demanded jealously, &#34;Who gave you these roses?Which man-?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without bothering to answer, Evelina sharply stomped on Cary&#39;s foot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah-damn it!&#34; Cary recoiled, stumbling in pain as he released her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cary, are you hurt?&#34; Margot hurried forward, glaring venomously at Evelina. &#34;You&#39;re insane-how dare-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She abruptly silenced herself, hastily smoothing her appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several handsome young men, contestants fresh from the stage, casually strode by, heading backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was about to vanish quietly when her eyes caught sight of someone at the tail end of the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had an exquisitely chiseled face and striking,defined features, his tall physique emanating unmistakable confidence and calm authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly the type Kristina dreamed of finding-a prime candidate destined for superstardom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps slightly older than the others, but that lent an intriguing maturity. Stardom was unquestionably within reach for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement gleamed in Evelina&#39;s eyes. Finally, a worthy candidate. Boldly, she approached him,extending the bouquet. &#34;I&#39;ve been looking for someone like you all night. These roses are yours-all ten of them. You&#39;re my choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man halted, an eyebrow arching subtly. His deep,magnetic voice was compelling. &#34;Are you certain about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper Russell&#39;s penetrating gaze assessed her, and the atmosphere in the corridor instantly grew tense.Even Cary, watching from a distance, felt a strange chill down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening here...? Who exactly was this stranger?</p>
