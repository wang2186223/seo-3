                <p>Chapter of her life,and it fascinated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart ached as he contemplated the hardships of young girl growing up without parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s resolve to defend the orphanage now made perfect sense to him. In each child she helped, he saw echoes of her own past struggles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina appeared, the children swarmed around her with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening her arms wide, Evelina welcomed them into a warm embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She affectionately tousled Susie&#39;s hair. &#34;Your braids are so pretty today, Susie. Did Kamryn do them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina then turned to Hans, giving his arm a gentle squeeze. &#34;Look at you, Hans! You&#39;re becoming so strong!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, she lifted four-year-old Minnie, showering her with kisses. &#34;Did you miss me,Minnie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew every child&#39;s name and showed genuine concern for their welfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unsurprisingly, the children revered her, seeing her part of their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn,watching this, said to Jasper, &#34;Minnie was born with a heart defect. Abandoned as an infant,many said she wouldn&#39;t make it. But Evelina wouldn&#39;t accept that. She enlisted top cardiac specialists,sparing no effort to ensure Minnie&#39;s survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn looked at Jasper with hopeful eyes, her voice trembling slightly. &#34;Mr. Russell, Evelina has faced many hardships. Love her well, if you truly care for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her belief in Jasper&#39;s character, Kamryn couldn&#39;t help but worry, fearing another heartbreak for Evelina similar to what she experienced with Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was such a treasure, deserving of the finest love one could offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve got her.&#34; The more Jasper uncovered about Evelina, the deeper his feelings grew-and all he wanted was to keep her safe,always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn, visibly relieved, wiped away a tear and beamed. &#34;Now, children, didn&#39;t you prepare something special for Evelina today? Who&#39;s ready to perform?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hans, brimming with enthusiasm, shouted, &#34;I am!Watch my dance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see it, Hans!&#34; Kamryn gestured for the other children to give Hans space to perform.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hans danced with surprising grace, demonstrating his natural talent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jasper approached Evelina, gently taking Minnie from her. &#34;Let me hold her for a bit. You must be tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina looked at him skeptically. &#34;Do you even know how to hold a child properly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie was just as small when I used to hold her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minnie seemed to take an instant liking to him, even planting a playful kiss on his cheek while he was momentarily distracted by Evelina.Her laughterfilled the air, infectious and joyful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, caught off guard, could only smile at her antics. Evelina chuckled. &#34;Minnie&#39;s got quite the spirit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a voice called out, &#34;Evelina-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina turned to see who it was, an unexpected attack came her way: a large bag of white powder aimed directly at her face!</p>
