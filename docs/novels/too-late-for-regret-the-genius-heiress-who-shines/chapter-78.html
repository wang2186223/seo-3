                <p>Evelina spoke softly, breaking the silence. &#34;There is one truth in Aurora&#39;s words, though. In families like hers, there always seems to be some dark secret just out of sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone grew somber. &#34;I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m done with the intrigues of powerful families. It&#39;s too dangerous;you never know who might be the next victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina remained quiet. She understood that Evelina had always desired nothing more than a calm,uncomplicated life. Otherwise, given her wealth, she would never have married into the Gibson family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, who could have predicted that the Gibsons,hardly a prominent family at all, would turn her three years of commitment into nothing more than a cruel joke? Back at the hotel, while Evelina reaxed in a bath,Kristina urgently called lan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a furious tone, Kristina said, &#34;That hypocrite Aurora had the nerve to visit Evelina before leaving Aglonard. She spewed all sorts of nonsense, claiming Evelina doesn&#39;t fit with the Russells.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shared everything candidly, explaining why Evelina had started pulling away from the Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier that day, lan had been berated three times already. Jasper was in a terrible mood, and his displeasure had rippled down to everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan attentively listened to Kristina&#39;s detailed account and immediately passed the information to his boss,careful not to change a single detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper responded with shock, &#34;Franklin Marsh told her about the assistant&#39;s death?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had suspected that Evelina must have found out somehow, which would explain her recent distant behavior.Despite his efforts, he hadn&#39;t been able to discover who had disclosed the information.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have thought it was Franklin, a man in another city, who had told her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, he called Florrie to his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie said with regret, &#34;&#39;I&#39;m sorry, Uncle... Evi asked me to keep it from you. She didn&#39;t want to burden you further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her head lowered, Florrie avoided his gaze,thinking she might be in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper comforted her softly. &#34;It&#39;s alright, Florrie.Just make sure in the future, you tell me everything right away, no matter the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then shifted the topic to the day Aurora left the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had been elsewhere on that particular day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s memory clicked.I remember now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb took me and Dr. Martinez out to discuss something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow fell over Jasper&#39;s face. &#34;That left Evi alone in the room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie nodded.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper scoffed coldly, &#34;Caleb actually stooped to enable Aurora&#39;s scheming? Was he naive or merely foolish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, he called the bodyguards who had been stationed outside the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They immediately acknowledged. &#34;Aurora told us she was here to apologize, and Evelina allowed her in, so we didn&#39;t stop her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper said, &#34;Evelina was still vulnerable, recovering her vision. Didn&#39;t you think Aurora could be a threat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to defend themselves, one bodyguard said,&#34;Before she entered, we searched her thoroughly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They never would have allowed her entry otherwise. They monitored the room attentively during her visit.After she departed, they made sure to check on Evelina, confirming her safety before letting Aurora leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why wasn&#39;t this incident reported afterward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until this moment, Jasper had been oblivious to the situation. Could he really trust these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, one guard said, &#34;Evelina instructed us not to say anything.&#34; His voice filled with remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, frustrated, dismissed them with a growl. &#34;Go see the butler for your punishment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to soothe his irritation, Florrie quickly brought him a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan attempted to interject, &#34;I mean, she was there to apologize. Surely she wouldn&#39;t have-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stern look from Jasper silenced him immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Florrie cautiously broached the subject again. &#34;Uncle, perhaps there&#39;s been a misunderstanding with Evi. We need to rectify this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing a spark of determination in Jasper&#39;s eyes,it was clear he was already formulating a plan to resolve the issue.</p>
