                <p>Right when Aurora was about to take her seat proudly next to Jasper, he unexpectedly reached out and invited Evelina to sit by him instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Aurora adopted a look of distress. &#34;Jasper, the two of you sitting together will surely spark rumors...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper cut her off sharply, saying, &#34;Sit down or leave. Why do you complain so much when you contribute so little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rendered speechless, Aurora could only shoot Cary a pleading look, silently imploring him to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that Cary was Evelina&#39;s husband in name, he apparently had the authority to correct her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Cary&#39;s timidity prevented him from uttering a single word in front of Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other option, Aurora begrudgingly took her seat again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the journey, she and Cary were crammed together, each simmering in their own discontent,irritating one another incessantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from them, Evelina and Jasper engaged in cheerful conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina grew weary, Jasper tenderly allowed her to lean her head on his shoulder, blatantly ignoring Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s frustration was evident, but a firm look from Jasper quickly silenced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The helicopter landed at the hot spring resort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina and Florrie greeted them,warmly linking arms with Evelina and leading her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had no choice but to trail behind the three, and Cary was even less able to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary wanted to remind Evelina of her duties as his wife, but getting close to her felt nearly impossible. Aurora looked down on his cowardice, constantly taunting him,&#34;Isn&#39;t Evelina supposed to be your wife? Will you allow her to behave so freely?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by anger and Aurora&#39;s provocations, Cary retorted, &#34;Why don&#39;t you handle it if you&#39;re so capable?You criticize so easily yet can&#39;t manage your own affairs. Why lash out at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora was so infuriated by his words that she nearly lost her composure entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the changing room, Evelina, Kristina, and Florrie laughed and chatted, their voices echoing with lighthearted conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet corner, Aurora hesitated to join the others in changing her clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware, Aurora didn&#39;t know Evelina had already messaged Kristina, plotting to find out if she had any hidden tattoos linked to the Children of the Gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment, Kristinainquired, &#34;Miss Marsh, why aren&#39;t you changing? Are you self-conscious about your body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, she boldly reached for Aurora, who quickly covered herself in defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina then crouched down and lifted the hem of Aurora&#39;s pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inspecting her ankles revealed no markings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Evelina&#39;s suspicions were misplaced?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! What are you trying to do?&#34; Sensing something was off, Aurora quickly pulled her feet away, suspicion flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gross!&#34; Kristina recoiled with exaggerated disgust. &#34;Your feet stink! Looks like the rumors were true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumors? Who spread such rumors? Ireah&#39;s elite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina cleverly masked her intrusive search as mere high society banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do us a favor and stay away from us in the hot spring-foot odor spreads, you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mocking smile, Kristina departed, hips swaying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, ever naive and unaware to the underlying tensions, noticed Aurora&#39;s distressed demeanor.Worrying she might be overwhelmed, Florrie comforted her, saying, &#34;Kristina is just teasing, she means no harm.Please, don&#39;t be upset, Aurora...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go, Florrie!&#34; Before Florrie could finish, Kristina pulled her away briskly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not Aurora was part of the Children of the Gods, one thing was clear-she was trouble. A sweet,simple girl like Florrie was better off keeping her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The changing room fell silent abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora stood there, her face pale for quite a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dare they undermine her? Determined, she resolved that Evelina and Kristina would regret their provocations.</p>
