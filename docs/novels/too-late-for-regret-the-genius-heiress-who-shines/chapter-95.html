                <p>Jasper found himself trapped in an agonizing choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His soul was tethered to Evelina, and instinctively, he wished for her survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But making that call would mean condemning Aurora to certain doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the Marsh family uncovered the truth, they would undoubtedly retaliate against the Russells-and Evelina would bear the brunt of their wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmph! Mmph!&#34; Aurora&#39;s mouth was bound, rendering her voiceless. Tears streamed down her face as she fixed pleading eyes on Jasper, silently urging him to choose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Evelina remained unsettlingly serene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure irked Mara, making everyone else appear feeble and scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing Evelina by the hair, Mara jerked her head backward. &#34;Aren&#39;t you terrified of dying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina didn&#39;t spare her a glance. Her eyes stayed locked on Jasper. &#34;If this is where I fall, will you remember me for the rest of your life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina!&#34; Jasper&#39;s usual poise had vanished; worry distorted his otherwise attractive face. &#34;I won&#39;t let you get hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Jasper,&#34; she said, arching a brow, her gaze drifting back to Aurora. &#34;If I perish today,you&#39;ll carry that guilt forever. No matter who stands beside you in the future, my place will never be replaced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deceased are often immortalized, their absence casting long shadows over the living.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially when their end is tied to someone else&#39;s survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper would never forgive Aurora-not in this lifetime. The thought of marrying her would become a distant fantasy.He&#39;d make her life unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing this, Aurora frantically tried to spit the cloth from her mouth, desperate to reveal Evelina&#39;s ploy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Evelina gave her no room to speak, her lips curled in triumph.&#34;Jasper, does this mean we&#39;re bound together forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she lunged toward a kidnapper&#39;s weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man,who had been targeting Cary, panicked and fired instinctively as Evelina crashed into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blast echoed through the space, freezing everything in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, the gunman stumbled backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina staggered before collapsing, crimson pooling around her lifeless form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s dead! Evelina&#39;s gone!&#34; Cary was the first to cry out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After threeyears of companionship, watching her fall like that was too much for him to process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following his outburst, Cary lost consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora trembled with rage, but the gag silenced her. Her eyes burned with fury as they met Mara&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, Mara turned on the shooter. &#34;You idiot! Who gave the order to fire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her shock, he dodged her furious kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something felt off. &#34;Who the hell are you?&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the lights above flickered, then snapped off completely, shrouding the lobby in darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another gunshot cracked through the silence, followed by Mara&#39;s scream as she hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic broke out among the wealthy hostages. &#34;Don&#39;t shoot! I swear I&#39;m innocent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the criminals were gripped by fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A second, then a third shot rang out-each bullet finding its mark. Chaos and confusion mounted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How were Jasper&#39;s allies able to hit targets with such precision in total darkness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the criminals was the first to react, shouting,&#34;We&#39;ve got fluorescent powder on us! Take off your jackets!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fluorescent powder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others checked their clothes and saw the faint glow of particles across their gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They realized they had been marked as targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a frenzy, they dropped their weapons, shrugged off their jackets, and searched for hiding spots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was too late for many of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the shooting finally ceased, a ghostly stillness settled over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some hostages had fainted, others crouched against the walls, terrified into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only four of the kidnappers remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They tried to slip away unnoticed, hoping the silence would fool Jasper into thinking every last kidnapper had been eliminated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as they inched toward the lobby doors, the overhead lights burst on with a blinding glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The four men froze-completely exposed under the harsh illumination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,look who itcame a calm voice. Evelina stood tall, a sniper rifle steady in her grip, aimed directly at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;You-you&#39;re still breathing? That&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet there she was-not just surviving, but radiant. Aside from the streaks of blood on her clothing, not a single wound marked her body.</p>
