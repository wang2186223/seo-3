                <p>On Evelina&#39;s request, Jasper ensured Hayden and the two thugs involved in her abduction were turned over to the authorities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina accompanied Evelina to the police station to file their reports.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they completed their statements, it was after midnight. Exhausted, Evelina fell into a brief sleep,only to be jolted awake by her alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a divorce appointment with Cary at the courthouse at 8 a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always on time, Evelina, despite her aches from the ordeal,took pain medication and made her way to the appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Cary had not appeared by 8:30.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After failing to reach him twice by phone, she discovered on the third attempt that his phone was turned off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t the late person supposed to bark like a dog?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By 9 a.m., Evelina&#39;s patience had worn thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She texted him in frustration, saying,&#34;Cary, get your ass to the courthouse.Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, there was no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She contacted his assistant to inquire about his whereabouts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an unhelpful tone likely influenced by Esme, the assistant responded, &#34;Mr. Gibson isn&#39;t in yet. He&#39;s probably with Miss Barton; she&#39;s not feeling well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, having been misled by Margot into thinking Hayden&#39;s men had succeeded, pretended to be ill to keep Cary at her place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her strategy seemed perfect-delay Cary long enough for Evelina to be dealt with, then together they could handle the aftermath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of the divorce appointment, Esme played up her symptoms when Cary attempted to leave around 8 a.m., pleading, &#34;Cary, I feel awful. Can you stay just a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s act of helplessness was convincing. Cary,ever gullible,found it impossible to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,he remained by her side throughout the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During one of his brief trips to the bathroom,Evelina&#39;s calls appeared on the phone screen. Esme, assuming these were calls from authorities about Evelina&#39;s demise, gleefully declined each one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then switched off his phone, ensuring no further disruptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the hurry? Evelina was already gone. They could take their time picking up the body</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Esme,Evelina posed no threat in life and certainly none in death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s satisfaction was evident; she envisioned a future where Cary was exclusively hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the courthouse, Evelina vented her frustration into the phone. &#34;If he&#39;s not man enough to show up for his own divorce, he&#39;ll be hearing from my attorney.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp click, she ended the call, her face set in a cold grimace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers swiftly navigated her phone contacts,selecting a rarely used number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response was immediate. &#34;Ah, the illustrious Queen Evelina graces me with a call! What command do you have for your loyal subject today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unmistakably vibrant and cheeky tone could only  belong to Lena Kendall, Evelina&#39;s go-to personal assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the top divorce attorney in the nation. Make it happen. I&#39;m through waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three long years had passed-years marked by unfulfilled commitments and emotional neglect.Evelina was ready to close this</p>
