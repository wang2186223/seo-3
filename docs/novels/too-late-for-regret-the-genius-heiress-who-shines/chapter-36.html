                <p>&#34;Even the small divorce settlement wouldn&#39;t buy you a decent handbag, and yet Cary is clawing it back?&#34;Caleb was exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he got Evelina&#39;s call, he had rushed to Morningstar Villas to strategize their next steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d always thought the Gibson family for lacking shame,yet they had outdone even his wildest notions of their greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is monstrous! Cary&#39;s actions are beyond forgiveness!&#34; Florrie exclaimed, her anger was clear as she balled her hands into fists, all set to confront Cary directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Demi still hopes that her grandson will reconcile with Ms. Marsh,&#34; lan scoffed, disbelief coloring his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan had returned from the Gibson Mansion with updates, reinforcing the notion that the Gibson family harbored ongoing schemes against Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wouldn&#39;t have a chance!&#34; Florrie and Caleb both shouted, their outrage mirroring each other&#39;s. Florrie stopped short, then quickly grabbed Evelina&#39;s arm, asserting her claim. &#34;Evelina is part of the Russell family now,and nobody else&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb,seizing Evelina&#39;s other arm, said, &#34;What are you talking about, Russell family? She&#39;s my family, and that&#39;s final.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s face scrunched up in dismay. &#34;Nonsense!Evelina is mine,all mine!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always thought Caleb was merely helping Evelina legally, not knowing he was a contender for her affection, challenging Jasper directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she finally understood why her uncle would grow tense as soon as he saw Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough, both of you,&#34; Jasper finally said, bringing calm with his voice. &#34;Florrie, remember, Evelina is still healing from her injuries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie promptly straightened up from where she had been resting her head on Evelina&#39;s shoulder,a show of her concern for Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb,noticing Florrie&#39;s change in posture, sheepishly released his grip on Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper,with a calm demeanor, turned to Evelina and inquired, &#34;What&#39;s your plan moving forward?&#34; He had always known Evelina as a woman of substance,unlikely to be rattled by the petty schemes of the Gibson family</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina offered Jasper a knowing smile. &#34;I suspect Cary&#39;s abrupt decision to strip me of everything might be Esme&#39;s handiwork.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Evelina&#39;s view, Cary had always been a puppet of his own selfish desires, now manipulated further by Esme&#39;s scheming and Elora&#39;s disdain. They thought they could leverage financial means as a weapon against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s gaze hardened as she said, &#34;Money isn&#39;t an issue for me. I can walk away without a penny,but the Gibsons will need to clear their debts. Caleb, draft a bill for Cary covering the cost of the surgeries I performed. Four surgeries, each at a minimum of five million, that&#39;s twenty million total.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb,energized by Evelina&#39;s assertive stance, clicked his fingers in agreement. &#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina wasn&#39;t finished. &#34;Moreover, inform him that I&#39;m prepared to absolve Margot and drop all criminal charges in exchange for ten million in compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb hesitated. &#34;Evelina,given your financial standing,demanding a billion from the Gibson family wouldn&#39;t be out of line.&#34; The requested amount of ten million seemed rather insignificant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really believe the Gibson Group could net a billion?&#34; Evelina asked, her tone laced with incredulity.They wouldn&#39;t fetch that much even if they liquidated the entire company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a decisive tone, Evelina instructed her assistant,Lena, over the phone, &#34;I&#39;ve met my responsibilities to the Gibson family. Moving forward, we will no longer offer them discounted raw materials.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had previously supported Cary&#39;s corporate struggles against his uncle by providing materials at half their cost. It was time to adjust those terms back to standard market rates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Furthermore, our affiliated retail brands will stop overpaying for Gibson Group products. We&#39;ll assess their offerings on par with all others, prioritizing only those that offer the best value and quality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was curious to witness how the Gibson Group would fare in the competitive market without her favorable support</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted within the Gibson Group the following day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Executives flooded Cary&#39;s office, delivering one piece of awful news after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gibson, terrible news-the cost of our raw materials has tripled overnight. Suppliers are sticking to what they claim is the current market rate, and they&#39;re not shy about giving our allotment to others if we refuse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gibson, there&#39;s more bad news-our clients are only offering to pay half of what they used to for our products, claiming that our competitors provide better quality for the same price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Gibson, there&#39;s an urgent issue-the Sight Weaver has issued us a bill demanding twenty million for medical procedures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary turned to Esme, who had just arrived to bring him lunch. &#34;A bill from the Sight Weaver? But aren&#39;t you the Sight Weaver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme,who had previously flaunted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million Cary had gifted her, was now supposedly billing for twenty million more for surgeries? This confusion deepened his frustration.</p>
