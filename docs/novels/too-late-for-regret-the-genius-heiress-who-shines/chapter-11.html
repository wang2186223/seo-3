                <p>At Morningstar Villas..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had secured the finest villa locally in advance to ensure Florrie&#39;s comfort during her treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa boasted her preferred amenities-a small garden, a swing set, and it came staffed with a maid and bodyguards for 24-hour supervision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why weren&#39;t you watching her? I instructed you to monitor her closely!How could she possibly disappear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper burst into Florrie&#39;s room, his gaze fixing on the vacant bed, his expression cold with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He searched the room himself, checking beneath the bed and behind the drapes. This disappearance wasn&#39;t a mere game of hide-and-seek; Florrie truly was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling noticeably, one of the female bodyguards stammered, &#34;She retired unusually early, sir. It all seemed so normal then. But upon our check-in... the bed was cunningly made to look occupied with just pillows under the covers. Both Miss Russell and her maid Jenny have vanished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did anyone review the surveillance footage? Have you checked outside?&#34; Panic edged Jasper&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brother and sister-in-law had entrusted him with Florrie&#39;s safety before they departed for Aglonard,stressing its importance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had embraced this duty with utmost graveness,always vigilant. Florrie, although resourceful and smart, was still a vulnerable teenager-and sightless.The thought of any harm coming to her was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir! Jenny has returned!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan rushed into the villa, escorting a distraught woman -Florrie&#39;s maid, Jenny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Jenny caught sight of Jasper, she fell to her knees, overwhelmed with tears. &#34;M-Mr. Russell...Florrie-she&#39;s been abducted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper contained the fury building within him, seized her by the arm, and hoisted her to her feet. &#34;Enough tears. Speak. Describe exactly what transpired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Struggling to regain composure, Jenny managed to recount the events. Florrie, ever the spirited and inquisitive girl, had overheard the villa staff discussing a street fair in northern Aglonard and incessantly pleaded to attend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had expressly forbidden it, citing the nighttime dangers. However, as soon as he departed for Dusk Lounge, Florrie convinced Jenny to help her escape from the bedroom balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She just hoped to explore a little and return unnoticed,&#34; Jenny explained, dabbing at her tears.&#34;But we encountered some thugs. Captivated by her beauty, they abducted her. I attempted to intervene -they assaulted me and fled. I couldn&#39;t catch them...I hurried back here to seek assistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body bore the marks of the ordeal, with bruises visible and knees bloodied from a fall, yet she did not pause for her wounds. In desperation, she pleaded,&#34;Please, Mr. Russell-we must find her quickly! If we delay, I dread to think what might happen. This is all my fault; I should never have agreed to her request...”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop. We&#39;ll address your actions later.&#34; Jasper shifted his attention to lan, signaling him with a decisive nod.lan sprang into action, mustering every member of the Russell security team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his team in place, Jasper instructed, &#34;Target the street fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,sir!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team surged forward, each member poised to scour the city if necessary. After receiving preliminary medical attention, Jenny insisted on joining them. As they prepared, she provided every detail she recalled. &#34;They used the local dialect, likely Aglonard natives... The vendors appeared terrified. It seems these thugs have dominated that area for some time. And one more thing-I heard them mention their leader, calling him &#39;Mr. Reid.&#39;&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reid?&#34; A shadow fell over Jasper&#39;s features, his tone turning cold. &#34;lan, compile a list of every individual in this city bearing the surname Reid. I want locations on all of them.&#34;</p>
