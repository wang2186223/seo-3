                <p>The bodyguards of the Russell family remained still, observing the Gibsons with an air of incredulity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, finding their antics hilarious, burst into laughter. &#34;Have you all finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora was gearing up to hurI more insults, but Evelina prevented her by brandishing a letter. &#34;I intended to free Margot today, but your behavior has changed my mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In full view of everyone, Evelina ripped the letter apart and confidently entered the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by her actions, Elora and Cary recovered too late to intercept her. The door to the operating room shut before they could reach it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan stood firm, blocking Elora and her entourage from following. Elora pounded her feet in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Russell, this is ridiculous! You should be expelling her!&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan&#39;s stare was cold as he replied, &#34;Mrs. Gibson, I don&#39;t need instructions on how to manage my responsibilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora was so scared, she didn&#39;t even dare to open her mouth again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme then stepped up to defend Elora, saying, &#34;Mr. Russell, there&#39;s been a misunderstanding! Evelina has tricked Demi with her doubtful medical skills. We were merely cautioning you against her deceit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora added quickly, &#34;She&#39;s nothing but a fraud pretending to know medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan, losing patience, shouted, &#34;Eńough! Have I not made it clear that Ms. Marsh is under the Russell family&#39;s protection? What right do you have to defame her so blatantly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme and Elora, cowering in fear, stepped back behind Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary was confused and concerned. Hadn&#39;t the Russell family been pleading with Esme to conduct~the surgery today? Yet, why was lan reacting so aggressively?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Aurora, clad in a hospital gown, who intervened and calmed the situation, persuading lan to allow Esme into the surgical area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora contemplated joining them, yet given Jasper&#39;s recent coldness, she decided against entering and remained outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon her entry into the operating room, Esme was taken aback by the sight of the changing room, the cleaning area, and the operating room entrance, which were all heavily guarded by the Russell family&#39;s armed bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anxiety mounting, she made her way into the changing room and frantically dialed the Sight Weaver&#39;s number on her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone remained silent except for a message that popped up, instructing,&#34;I&#39;m already in the operating room,come here directly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s confusion mounted. She had reached out to the Sight Weaver upon her arrival at the hospital,who was not yet present.How could she have entered the operating room before her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other options and a rising sense of desperation, Esme sent a threatening message. &#34;Don&#39;t play any tricks, or Landen&#39;s grave will suffer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She included a photo of Landen&#39;s tombstone in the message. If the Sight Weaver pushed her,Esme wouldn&#39;t think twice about splashing red paint and waste oil all over his grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Receiving no response, Esme convinced herself that her intimidation had been effective.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then completed her preparations and approached the operating room clad in her surgical gear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Florrie was already sedated, with the surgery imminent. Jasper reluctantly stepped away from his niece as the anesthesia took full effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to enter now! I&#39;m the Sight Weaver, the lead surgeon for Miss Russell,&#34; Esme said, confronting the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards who blocked her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her in.&#34; Evelina&#39;s voice rang out, striking a chord of familiarity with Esme-though she couldn&#39;t bring herself to believe Evelina was the surgeon that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Esme confidently strode towards the operating table, she failed to recognize Evelina, whose face was obscured by a surgical cap and mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She surveyed the medical staff and surgical tools arranged on the table, then noticed Florrie, already prepared on the table. &#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s demeanor suggested she was in charge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which &#39;she&#39; are you inquiring about?&#34; asked Evelina&#39;s skilled assistant, Dorothea Martinez.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The esteemed senior to whom l&#39;ve made my payments,&#34; Esme responded, clearly expecting some recognition for her financial contribution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you perhaps looking for the authentic Sight Weaver, Miss Barton?&#34; Dorothea retorted with a hint of sarcasm, puzzled by the confidence of this apparent imposter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your statements are confusing.&#34; Esme was too cunning to openly confess that she wasn&#39;t the real Sight Weaver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was my comment unclear? Very well, from this point, you&#39;ll lead the surgery. Also, be aware that this procedure is being filmed and broadcast live.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea gestured towards the camera mounted in the operating room, adding a stern warning, &#34;Mr. Russell has arranged for top ophthalmology experts to observe. Any slip-up, and you may find yourself unable to leave.Please,proceed!&#34;</p>
