                <p>Esme exchanged Cary&#39;s gifted sapphire earrings for a hundred million, but she cleverly withheld most of the funds from Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She provided Evelina with a bank certificate displaying the total amount but only wired twenty million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The restoration of Miss Russell&#39;s vision will require multiple surgeries, not just one. I&#39;ll release the remaining funds based on the results,&#34; Esme explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme then issued a stark warning to Evelina, saying, &#34;Ensure Miss Russell&#39;s full recovery if you expect to receive the entire payment. Fail, and your reputation might suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. &#34;And how exactly do you think you&#39;ll manage that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even standing face to face with Esme and declaring herself as the Sight Weaver might not convince Esme of her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the phone, Esme&#39;s laughter had a manic edge. &#34;You may hide, but I know where to find Landen&#39;s grave!&#34;Evelina,appalled by the disrespect, said, &#34;What are you planning with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep your end of the bargain with Miss Russell&#39;s eyes, and Landen&#39;s grave stays untouched,&#34; Esme replied coldly, then abruptly ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surgery day came around swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the surgical suite, Cary, Elora, and Sebastian&#39;s presence alongside Esme drew significant attention.All were impeccably attired, keen to impress the Russell family with their appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme particularly stood tall and confident, her demeanor radiating conceit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should the surgery prove successful, she envisaged herself as the benefactor to whom the Russell family would forever be indebted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Russell!&#34; Elora caught sight of lan near the operating room and quickly approached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan&#39;s duty was to ensure the surgery proceeded without disturbances, flanked by bodyguards outside the operating room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also had to maintain Jasper&#39;s facade for the Russell family during these moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the real Jasper had already accompanied Florrie to the operating room, staying by her side at Evelina&#39;s allowance until the procedure was ready to commence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Gibson,&#34; lan responded with courtesy, though he scrutinized Elora&#39;s extravagant dress with a critícal eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora, emboldened by his acknowledgment, didn&#39;t hesitate to plead, &#34;Mr. Russell, my future daughter-in-law will undoubtedly restore Miss Russell&#39;s vision. In return, could you assist in releasing mý daughter from detention? She&#39;s been held for days now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan interjected,&#34;That&#39;s feasible. Assuming Miss Barton achieves success with the surgery, we can discuss this further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s expression brightened with hope. &#34;Of course, Esme has already assured me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan interrupted sharply, &#34;But should she fail, you understand the implications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stern look in his eyes caused Elora to recoil slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nervous flutter of her hands, Elora insisted, &#34;That won&#39;t happen. Esme&#39;s record is flawless.You have nothing to worry about...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan&#39;s response was cold, curt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing further conversation was futile,Elora shifted her focus back to Esme, urging her to take extra precautions to guarantee the operation&#39;s success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Esme was caught in the middle ofa group of hospital staff and media, all eager for her comment or a photo, leaving her no chance to heed Elora&#39;s advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora, unable to express her frustration openly, was interrupted by Evelina&#39;s arrival with her surgical team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you show your face here, you wretch! You think you belong?&#34; Elora confronted Evelina, her voice filled with hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgical team, highly esteemed in their field, were taken aback by such hostility and stood ready to dismiss Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dismiss it, everyone, please proceed inside and start setting up,&#34; Evelina instructed her team toward the operating room, eager to prevent any additional disturbances before the surgery commenced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora, mistaking Evelina&#39;s composed demeanor for weakness, escalated her taunts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, who are you trying to deceive? You bastard, an orphan with no formal education, dare to enter this hospital in such attire? Are you here to cause problems? You must be terrified that Esme will successfully treat Miss Russell and win Demi&#39;s favor, leaving you out in the cold with the Gibson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words attracted the attention of Cary, Esme, and others nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,observing Evelina in her immaculate white coat, suspected her of trying to provoke him and even fantasized that she was provocatively dressed beneath it.③</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pretended to uphold moral standards, scolding Evelina, &#34;What&#39;s with this getup? This is a hospital, not a venue for your indecency.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme sneered at Evelina, &#34;Donning a white coat doesn&#39;t make you a doctor, Ms. Marsh. You look utterly preposterous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mockery led others, including uninformed staff, to laugh and point at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian was taken aback by the beauty of Cary&#39;s former wife, his envy tinged with fascination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Divorced and yet here you are, dressed provocatively to chase him down! Calling you brazen barely covers it! Such women ought to be expelled on the spot!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Supported by the crowd&#39;s reaction, Elora even demanded the Russell family&#39;s security, saying, &#34;Expel.this disruptive woman immediately!&#34;</p>
