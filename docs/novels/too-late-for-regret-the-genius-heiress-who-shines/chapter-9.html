                <p>Evelina, somewhat inebriated, failed to grasp the atmosphere,focusing instead on the unease brewing in her gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She selected a vibrant red rose from the bouquet,gently pressing its petals against the chiseled jawline of the man standing before her. &#34;Don&#39;t hold back,rising star. With your looks? You&#39;re clearly destined for the spotlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking,Evelina casually broke the stem and placed the rose in his suit pocket as if it perfectly belonged there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man, Jasper Russell, clenched his jaw, his face turning cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rising star? Did this woman genuinely mistake him for a male escort?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this now!&#34; In an attempt to defuse the situation,Cary intervened abruptly, forsaking his previous concern for Margot. He seized Evelina by the arm,steering her towards the door. &#34;My apologies, sir-she&#39;s not herself; she&#39;s had too much to drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nearly introduced her as his wife but swallowed the term at the last moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not drunk. Release me!&#34; Evelina shot him a fierce look, pulling her arm away. &#34;We&#39;re divorced,remember? Start acting like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, with no word of apology,thrust the remaining roses into Jasper&#39;s hands and made her exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,seething, hurried after her. &#34;Evelina, what on earth are you doing? Flirting with someone else right in my presence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed,Evelina continued on her path, not giving him the satisfaction of a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silence only fueled his anger. &#34;Seriously? This is what you&#39;ve come to? This is your big move to get my attention? Pathetic. You&#39;re acting like some spoiled kid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She halted, turning to face him with a weary and dismissive gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finished?&#34; Evelina asked, her voice dripping with fatigue. &#34;I&#39;m eager to get some rest. And don&#39;t flatter yourself.I&#39;ve never loved you, and I never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s expression contorted with frustration. &#34;Alright then! Tomorrow at eight, the courthouse. We finalize the divorce. Don&#39;t be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with relief. &#34;Sure,&#34; Evelina replied with a radiant smile. &#34;And if you&#39;re late, prepare to imitate a dog.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went their separate ways after the exchange; he reentered the venue, she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, as Evelina waited for her taxi, she quickly composed a message to Kristina, saying, &#34;Located your &#39;rising star.&#39; Mission accomplished. Off to bed now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to send the message, a dark figure loomed behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned sharply, only to be caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sack was thrown over her head, plunging her into darkness as her phone clattered to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two minutes later, Margot&#39;s phone vibrated with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot,having discreetly followed a group of trainees backstage, blended in unnoticed by the staff who mistook her for a crew member, allowing her to move freely behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot was indulging in the scene before her when Hayden&#39;s call interrupted her reverie. She picked up with enthusiasm. &#34;You secured her? Excellent, Hayden, this will definitely count in your favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Cary&#39;s voice interrupted from behind.&#34;Secured who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Margot ended the call abruptly. &#34;C-Cary?What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seized her wrist, pulling her from the scene. &#34;I was looking for you! This isn&#39;t a suitable place for someone of your standing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he recalled her conversation with Hayden, he warned,&#34;Keep your distance from the likes of Hayden Reid. He&#39;s bad news. Remember, you&#39;re to marry into the Russell family. It&#39;s time you behaved accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, I know...&#34; Margot beamed as she latched onto his arm, all sweet and cheerful again while they walked away from the backstage area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,her eyes betrayed a sinister resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina won&#39;t escape this time. Nobody will come to rescue her,&#34; she thought.</p>
