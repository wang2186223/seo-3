                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; Evelina was deep in conversation through text with Caleb when Jasper&#39;s interjection caught her attention. She glanced up, took a second to register his words, and responded, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Jasper.Caleb&#39;s in Ireah but he&#39;ll return soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, overhearing the conversation, expressed her astonishment. &#34;Really? He&#39;s coming back already?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was aware that lan had exerted a lot of effort to ensure Caleb was sent far from Aglonard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina explained while texting, &#34;He&#39;s actually on vacation. So after he deals with the urgent matter at hand,he will come back immediately.&#34; She looked at Florrie, confused by her reaction.there an issue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie exhaled, trying to hide her concern. &#34;No, it&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed inwardly. Her uncle&#39;s journey to a love life seemed turbulent from the very beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,at the Gibson Group, Cary was struggling under immense pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suppliers had increased their prices significantly, and the largest purchaser of Gibson&#39;s products was exploiting Cary&#39;s desperation by lowering their offers, relentlessly critiquing the quality, and demanding additional modifications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his tenure began at Gibson Group, Cary had not encountered such a horrible situation. He was struggling to keep the company afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, another urgent matter came from the finance department. &#34;Mr. Gibson, there was a transfer of three hundred million from our funds to purchase earrings for Miss Barton. It&#39;s imperative you reimburse the company promptly. We&#39;re facing a multitude of issues lately, and our cash flow is critically strained.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The potential collapse of cash flow presented a terrible scenario that Cary couldn&#39;t even begin to fathom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s temper flared as he asked, &#34;Is there no one here who can come up with a solution?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finance team was tasked with fund management, not revenue creation; their hands were tied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Originally, when Cary decided to extract funds from the company&#39;s reserves, the finance director had staunchly objected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using his clout, Cary coerced her into compliance by promising a swift reimbursement within a month. She agreed,albeit with great reluctance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve exhausted all options and now must turn to you for help, Mr. Gibson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cary found himself equally devoid of alternatives and resorted to desperately calling for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pleas for help were met with refusal after refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We previously extended help because of our debt to Ms. Marsh. Since you&#39;re no longer associated, our obligation no longer stands.&#34; This was the common retort from suppliers and buyers alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did the reality dawn on Cary; the Russell family&#39;s remarks about his dependence on Evelina&#39;s influence to best his uncle weren&#39;t just mere assertions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how had Evelina, ostensibly just a housewife, managed to amass such leverage over influential businessmen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed and disheveled, Cary slackened his tie and contemplated whether to dial Evelina&#39;s number,his thumb hovering over her contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was merely a separation. Cary believed he could ensure Evelina wouldn&#39;t suffer financially and they could part as friends. Why was she complicating the situation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cary, lunch is ready.&#34; Esme approached with a lunchbox, her demeanor soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he saw her, Cary felt his spirits lift, and he turned his phone over on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme possessed intelligence, beauty, and a prestigious background. An alumna of an international university, she had been mentored by/Landen himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She surpassed Evelina in every way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had been instrumental in his victory over his uncle, but Cary was confident Esmne could elevate his career even further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m truly fortunate to have you,&#34; Cary said, caressing her hand gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cary...&#34; Nestling into his embrace, Esme murmured softly, &#34;My brother inquired again today about our marriage. How much are you setting aside for my security? My family considers it a mere formality, yet they&#39;ve set aside a hundred million as my dowry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Esme projected generosity and understanding, her intentions were quite calculated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her family was ready with a hundred million; Cary should at least match that, shouldn&#39;t he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s face darkened at the mention of finances. &#34;I&#39;ve given you the Starry Night Earrings worth three hundred million. Doesn&#39;t that show my commitment?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme felt a jolt of surprise but quickly masked it with a smile. &#34;That&#39;s precisely what I reassured my parents.Yet, they feel it&#39;s insufficient. It&#39;s mostly for appearances, to impress our acquaintances.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled and said, &#34;They insist on making a grand event out of my first marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary caught the underlying scorn for his second marriage attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression turned grim abruptly. &#34;I need to go to a meeting. You better go prepare for Miss Russell&#39;s surgery the day after tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme was taken aback by his curt dismissal. She lingered, hoping to speak further, but Cary had already exited the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme stamped her foot in annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had managed to contact the Sight Weaver earlier today, only to be stunned by the demand for one hundred million to perform the surgery that could potentially restore Florrie&#39;s vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusal meant risking her false identity being revealed to the Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, she had turned to Cary for support, not anticipating his indifferent response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now what was she to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One hundred million-such a sum was nowhere within her reach.</p>
