                <p>Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. &#34;Of course I won&#39;t regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it&#39;s your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he&#39;d face her wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, &#34;I&#39;m not explaining anything to her. In these past three years,I&#39;ve settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren&#39;t you madly in love with Esme? What&#39;s wrong-can&#39;t even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi&#39;s generosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she&#39;d readily stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead,she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him,and managed the household without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had one modest request-a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end,they&#39;d peacefully part ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, finally,her freedom had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True love conquers everything,&#34; Evelina replied dryly,sarcasm lightly coating her words. &#34;I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary&#39;s younger sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, I heard you&#39;re divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property-you can&#39;t take it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina laughed coldly. &#34;I paid for this car myself.Honestly, Margot, you&#39;re just as brazen as Cary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward.&#34;What&#39;s happening here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately,Margot complained petulantly, saying,&#34;Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I wwas planning to use it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brow creased slightly. &#34;Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.&#34; &#34;Absolutely not,&#34; she replied coldly. &#34;Why should I?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re unbelievable!&#34; Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle,followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The car is yours-I don&#39;t want it,&#34; Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything she&#39;d used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxuury car awaited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina&#39;s jaw dropped dramatically. &#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t the real Queen Evelina herself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes.&#34;Three years, Evelina. Every call I&#39;ve made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn&#39;t tell whether I&#39;d attended your wedding or your funeral back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly.&#34;Finally done with that &#39;blind&#39; fool? Good. Now we start living for real.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically.&#34;Wait,no-l need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too late,&#34; Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night.The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s that for a farewell gift?&#34; Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina erupted into laughter. &#34;There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. &#34;Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary&#39;s recovery, barely managing to rest properly Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her-&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; Cary interrupted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, &#34;Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone,saying,&#34;Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme-she&#39;ll see how much you&#39;ve changed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t talk nonsense,&#34; Cary retorted iritably,though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. &#34;Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Russell family, among lreah&#39;s most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir,wasn&#39;t only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs.Russell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I haven&#39;t forgotten,&#34; Margot murmured shyly,blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung affectionately to Cary&#39;s arm,adding eagerly,&#34;He&#39;s visiting for his niece&#39;s eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell&#39;s eyesight,she&#39;ll become indispensable to the Russell family-and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary gave a thoughtful nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell&#39;s favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,&#34; he suggested encouragingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, thank you, Cary!&#34; Margot&#39;s eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Cary&#39;s thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had dismissed her as plain, passive,even boring This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he&#39;d overlooked for three years.</p>
