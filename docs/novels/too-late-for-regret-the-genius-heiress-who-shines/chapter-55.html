            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>The newcomer tilted her chin upward, her voice carrying a subtle arrogance. &#34;I&#39;m Aurora Marsh from Ireah&#39;s Marsh family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement flashed across Sebastian&#39;s eyes as he eagerly responded, &#34;You&#39;re Aurora Marsh, the famed Marsh family heiress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to Aurora&#39;s adoption soon after the disappearance of the Marsh family&#39;s biological daughter, outsiders generally assumed Aurora to be the true heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora carefully masked her contempt with a graceful smile. &#34;Jasper Russell is my fiance. Given that connection, the Russell family is prepared to overlook Miss Barton&#39;s minor indiscretion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sebastian practically jumped with joy, eagerly stepping closer to Aurora. &#34;Thank you so much,Ms.Marsh!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw himself as a good-looking, capable young man and hoped his looks might catch the eye of some wealthy heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t aiming to marry into money-just wanted a powerful family to see his potential and trust him with their fortune. His dream was to become a stock market genius and the go-to name in financial advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to thank me,&#34; Aurora replied curtly, subtly distancing herself from his overly enthusiastic approach. &#34;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to speak privately with Miss Barton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her politeness was merely for show; Aurora&#39;s personal security had already firmly escorted Sebastian from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme felt a flutter of nervousness as she faced Aurora alone, uncertain yet intrigued.&#34;Ms. Marsh, may I ask why you&#39;ve come to speak with me privately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora offered an empathetic smile and said; &#34;I&#39;m here to help because we&#39;re facing similar troubles. I&#39;ve learned about your history with Cary. Without Evelina&#39;s interference, perhaps you wouldn&#39;t have wasted so much precious time. Now she&#39;s leveraging her medical skills to get closer to Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I have complete trust in my fiance, but with our wedding date under discussion, I can&#39;t risk any unexpected issues. Surely, Miss Barton, you can sympathize with my position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Esme immediately felt a bond of shared grievance against Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina is truly awful! She manipulates people using her charm and talents and steals men who don&#39;t belong to her,&#34; Esme bitterly exclaimed. Determined, Esme urged Aurora, saying, &#34;You&#39;re the Marsh family heiress and Jasper Russell&#39;s fiancee; you absolutely cannot let her succeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora gave a delicate sigh. &#34;Unfortunately, my hands are tied. Florrie is family, and her recovery still depends on Dr. Marsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to act, Esmne quickly volunteered. &#34;Is there any way I can help you with this situation?&#34;,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the offer, but I don&#39;t need you to do anything directly,&#34; Aurora said gently. &#34;Just protect your relationship from those who have ulterior motives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme paused, stunned by Aurora&#39;s seemingly selfless intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Aurora truly here just to mediate issues, without personal gain? Could someone this benevolent really exist?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually, Cary and I might never recover our relationship,&#34; Esme replied anxiously. &#34;Could you possibly offer ore assistance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant smiled discreetly. &#34;I just can&#39;t stand Evelina. I&#39;ve done this behind my boss&#39;s back, so please keep it confidential. I&#39;ll continue assisting you quietly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing that the assistant acted secretly, Esme immediately agreed to secrecy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After studying the documents closely, Esme swiftly departed, unaware that Aurora&#39;s agents tracked every step she took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora reclined comfortably in her hospital room, savoring freshly cut fruit provided by her servant, a satisfied smile spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme mistakenly believed she could exploit Aurora; little did she know Aurora viewed her as nothing more than a pawn against Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Aurora&#39;s phone rang. She answered, listening as the person reported, &#34;Evelina submitted a forgiveness letter to the authorities regarding Margot&#39;s case. Margot is scheduled for release tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s eyes turned cold as she responded dismissively, &#34;Must I handle such trivial matters myself? Find a way to ensure Margot remains detained a bit longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Match</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ving enjoyed a peaceful night&#39;s rest at Morningstar Villas, Evelina swiftly packed some essentials before iding to the hospital to look after Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>,to Evelina&#39;s attentive care post-operation, Florrie&#39;s vision recovery had exceeded all initial expectations ·the last ten days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>:le Jasper, I can finally see your face again! I&#39;m beyond happy!&#34; Florrie exclaimed joyfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>a had reminded Florrie repeatedly to stay calm, yet Florrie&#39;s joy burst forth uncontrollably after years trapped in darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ghout her life, her family had sought help from countless specialists, each concluding that regaining ht was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ed to a future of blindness, Florrie had almost lost hope-until her family discovered Evelina, the Sight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>simply offering hope, Evelina had achieved the miraculous, restoring Florrie&#39;s eyesight completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>vou&#39;ve been incredibly brave and strong,&#34; Jasper said gently, tenderly wiping her joyful tears away.en carefully to Evelina&#39;s advice and please stop crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>othed his niece with care, dabbing her tears away with a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, Florrie suddenly lifted her head, eyes wide with wonder as she gazed intently at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, you&#39;re absolutely stunning! Far more beautiful than l imagined-and look at your amazing figure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling slightly embarrassed, Evelina was surprised by Florrie&#39;s swift transition to playful teasing moments after regaining her sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly glanced at Jasper, silently pleading for his assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jasper merely smiled affectionately, clearly amused and indulgently letting Florrie continue her teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Evelina could respond, Florrie&#39;s hands excitedly wrapped around her waist, holding tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your waist is unbelievably slender! Uncle Jasper, you&#39;re incredibly lucky to have met someone so amazing! Uncle Jasper-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie mischievously addressed Jasper again. &#34;You&#39;d better cherish Evelina, because someone else will surely pursue such an exceptional woman... Ah! Aurora, you&#39;ve come to visit me? Did you rush here from Ireah because you heard I&#39;m being discharged today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina only noticed Aurora standing at the hospital room&#39;s doorway after hearing Florrie&#39;s greeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Aurora had been quietly observing the entire scene, absorbing every single playful remark from Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems like l&#39;ve interrupted an intimate moment,&#34; Aurora said coldly, forcing a tight-lipped smile that dripped with disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all, you&#39;re right on timFlorrie responded cheerfully, deliberately emphasizing her earlier words for Aurora to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, merely letting Aurora hear those words wasn&#39;t enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She boldly approached Aurora, linking arms affectionately and saying casually, &#34;Aurora, don&#39;t you agree Uncle Jasper and Evelina are simply perfect together? They look exactly like a married couple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her deliberate provocation was an unmistakable message to Aurora-Jasper was off-limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora struggled visibly, fighting to keep her composure despite the insult, refraining from pulling away abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Evelina hasn&#39;t officially divorced yet, right?&#34; Aurora&#39;s reply was subtly resentful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her implication-that Evelina was behaving inappropriately while still married-was unmistakably clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina caught the sting beneath her words and knew whatever she didn&#39;t say out loud was probably even nastier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was ready to fire back when Caleb&#39;s voice thundered from the doorway. &#34;I&#39;m the one handling Evelina&#39;s divorce case. She&#39;s officially free, and who she chooses to be with is her business-not yours,Aurora.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With casual ease, Caleb entered the room and protectively placed an arm around Evelina&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s expression darkened with indignation. &#34;Caleb, you&#39;re lowering yourself by involving with a divorced woman who&#39;s older-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least I&#39;m not desperately claiming to be engaged to someone clearly uninterested,&#34; Caleb swiftly retorted, deliberately involving Jasper. &#34;Do you honestly see any hint of affection toward you from him?&#34;</p>
