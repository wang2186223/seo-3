                <p>&#34;Florrie, please, no more words,&#34; Evelina pleaded silently, her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just in time, lan appeared with the doctor, who immediately began checking on Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Evelina hoped they could move past the awkward moment, Jasper&#39;s cool, incisive voice cut through the air. &#34;Indeed, we have met before. Evelina gifted me with ten roses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?!&#34; Florrie&#39;s eyes sparkled with excitement.&#34;Evelina, that&#39;s incredible! You&#39;re the first woman to ever give flowers to my uncle and not end up regrettingit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie nudged Evelina playfully.ome on, be honest,do you like him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Evelina hesitated, then spoke the truth. &#34;I&#39;m married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no!&#34; Florrie&#39;s face fell. &#34;You&#39;re married and you flirted with my uncle? That&#39;s not cool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina quickly explained, &#34;I&#39;ve already signed the divorce papers, and the roses were just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, however, wasn&#39;t interested in excuses. At the mention of divorce, her demeanor changed instantly,and she clasped Evelina&#39;s arm, her voice bubbling with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re free then! My uncle is considered Ireah&#39;s most eligible bachelor-many women chase after him,but he likes none of them. Neither do l.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, Florrie whispered, &#34;But I do like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie might have been sheltered, but she was perceptive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina didn&#39;t know her or Eloise, not even a hint of their pasts, yet she still put her life on the line for them.Women like her were rare-one in a million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie had noticed that Jasper appeared genuinely interested in Evelina, which was unusual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she, as his niece, not play a small part in nudging this along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite the clever one,&#34; Evelina said, giving Florrie&#39;s head a gentle pat, looking for a graceful exit from their intense chat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards were efficiently securing the captured thugs, while another squad re-entered the derelict factory to ensure no one escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina marveled at their meticulous work and then turned to Jasper. &#34;What&#39;s going to happen to these men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s response was terse. &#34;We&#39;ll handle it privately,&#34;he replied, a decision driven by the desire to shield Florrie&#39;s public image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their world, a family&#39;s reputation could be its downfall. Just one scandal could attract a frenzy of media predators, ready to tear apart even a well-guarded heiress like Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had kept in mind the tragic tale of the Marsh family in lreah, who were among the city&#39;s elite yet not immune to tragedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their lost daughter had been subjected to cruel rumors: sold off, seen in dubious establishments, and worse. The girl&#39;s mother, Vivienne Marsh, had wept until she was blind, and the father, Franklin Marsh&#39;s once-stellar career had teetered on the brink of ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina agreed with Jasper&#39;s plan but set her terms.&#34;I accept,but l insist on dealing personally with Hayden Reid and the two thugs who initially attacked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three long years, Evelina had tole rated Margot,fulfilling all duties expected of a sister-in-law. Yet, Margot had wished death upon her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was time for Evelina to seek justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so,&#34; Jasper replied, his gaze cold as he looked down at her, a faint smirk playing at his lips.&#34;There are still matters you and I need to resolve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran up Evelina&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he still holding a grudge over the incident with the roses?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina bowed slightly. &#34;My apologies. I was intoxicated. I mistook you for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does being drunk excuse flirting indiscriminately?&#34;Jasper interrupted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it doesn&#39;t,&#34; she responded, attempting to clarify.&#34;It was a misunderstanding-you&#39;re quite attractive,and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was the mix-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; Jasper&#39;s tone was cutting. &#34;Do you often approach attractive strangers?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina massaged her temples, feeling the conversation spiral further out of control. Each response seemed to dig her deeper. Suddenly, the gleam of a blade caught her eye. A knife was being drawn,aimed directly at Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie, get down!&#34; Without a second thought,Evelina threw herself in front of the girl, ready to take the blow herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the expected strike never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina turned, she noticed Jasper intercepting the attack,his arm now bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood streamed down his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been Hayden, still intent on harm-he had hurled a knife towards Florrie. Quickly subdued by Jasper&#39;s security, Hayden was incapacitated and restrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, sensing the smell of blood, panicked. &#34;Who&#39;s bleeding? Evelina, are you okay?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not me. It&#39;s your uncle.&#34; Evelina reassured her as she hurried to Jasper&#39;s side to assess his injury. just a shallow cut. It doesn&#39;t look deep. No need for stitches, and the blade wasn&#39;t poisoned. You&#39;re going to be okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swiftly took a first aid kit from the medical team,cleaned the wound with antiseptic, and bandaged it expertly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a doctor?&#34; Jasper inquired, impressed by her skill. The bleeding had stopped quickly under her careful handling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not,&#34; Evelina responded, choosing not to disclose more about her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Kristina&#39;s voice broke through the tension. &#34;Mr. Russell, hold on! Don&#39;t harm her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Misreading the scene, Kristina dashed from her vehicle and positioned herself protectively in front of Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I know you&#39;re upset, thinking she should be accountable for earlier, but listen to me! You must not harm her. She&#39;s the Sight Weaver-the only one who can restore Miss Russell&#39;s vision!&#34; Kristina said,her hand raised as if taking an oath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| assure you, I&#39;m speaking the truth!&#34; she added fervently.</p>
