                <p>Chapter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Caleb knew Jasper well enough to understand that the issue with Ady was far from resolved. He informed the cousins not out of courtesy, but to prepare them for Jasper&#39;s inevitable actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was particularly important given their recent anger towards Ady for her harsh treatment of their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb was taken aback by his cousins&#39; reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get it twisted, Caleb. Mr. Russell is a cold and calculating man, not the type to get soft over anyone,&#34; one cousin skeptically said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They scoffed at the idea that Jasper would go to such lengths for a woman who had already been through a marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would believe that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the unfolding events soon challenged their disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan visited Petal Creek Orphanage and efficiently uncovered the teacher responsible for the magic powder switch. With Kamryn&#39;s unwavering assistance, they secured a confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The teacher admitted he had been bribed by Aurora&#39;s assistant, supporting his statemnent with bank records.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan diligently captured the confession on video and gathered all pertinent evidence,forwarding it directly to the Marsh family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s stance was simple-Evelina deserved justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the Marsh brothers braced themselves,Franklin and Ady were caught off guard.  Ady was quick to dismiss the allegations. &#34;Absurd!I&#39;ve never ordered anyone to harm that girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Franklin,standing by his ethical principles,refused to defend his mother against these serious charges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;You manipulated Aurora&#39;s assistant by threatening her sister, leading her to corrupt the orphanage teacher. That teacher then tampered with the boy&#39;s magic powder, resulting in Evelina&#39;s accident. Jasper has documented proof linking each of these actions. The evidence is conclusive. How can you deny it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then added bluntly, &#34;It must be you or Aurora. If Aurora orchestrated this, she will face grave consequences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady, furious, lifted her cane at her eldest son. &#34;Have you forgotten whose son you are? How dare you accuse your mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin did not flinch as the cane hovered above him. &#34;Strike if you must, but afterward, you must assume responsibility. Evelina is known as the Sight Weaver. Caleb once mentioned inviting her to treat Vivienne&#39;s eyes. I was worried about her skills and didn&#39;t agree, but now she&#39;s cured Florrie&#39;s eyes.Despite my initial doubts about her, her skills are undeniable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin had been about to discuss inviting Evelina to treat Vivienne&#39;s eyes when the incident occurred.So his frustration was understandable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Ady, overcome with rage, struck Franklin on the shoulder with her cane. &#34;Are you implying that I orchestrated Evelina&#39;s blinding to prevent her from treating Vivienne? I must assume responsibility?Even after Jasper&#39;s actions led to Aurora&#39;s assistant&#39;s demise, I haven&#39;t pursued that issue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin had grown used to his mother&#39;s explosive temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing his ground, he said, &#34;The death of the assistant was tragic but unintentional. Her involvement in a harmful scheme led Jasper to her.I&#39;ll see to her funeral arrangements and ensure that Aurora takes in her sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady&#39;s anger flared again. &#34;Have you lost your senses? Aurora isn&#39;t even wed, and now you propose she raise a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Tell me, did Aurora know about the threats you made to her assistant? If not, then on whose behalf were you targeting Evelina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady was beside herself with rage, struggling to form words. &#34;You despise Aurora&#39;s closeness to me, don&#39;t you? This is revenge for the remarks I made about your wife! Aurora might not be my flesh and blood,but she has been a part of our family for over two decades. Isn&#39;t that akin to being my own granddaughter? Why can&#39;t you and Vivienne show her some affection? It&#39;s not her fault that Jazmine is gone-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother!&#34; Franklin&#39;s loud interruption cut through the room,causing Ady to pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He directed her attention with his gaze, and Ady spun around, her breath catching at the sight of Vivienne&#39;s weary face.</p>
