                <p>Elora attempted to counter, but Cary intervened,&#34;Mom,let it be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the Russell family not attended today, Cary and Elora might have swayed Demi to coerce Evelina into absolving Margot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,it was evident that Mr. Russell supported Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary remained puzzled over why the prestigious Russell family would align with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all your fault for raising such a &#39;wonderful child&#39;who dared to do this to Evelina?&#34; In a burst of anger,Demi struck Elora across the face in front of all present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora could only gaze at Demi in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s focus remained solely on Evelina, comforting her. &#34;My dear, you&#39;ve suffered injustice at the hands of the Gibson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s look towards Evelina was one of sheer loathing,as though she wished to destroy the latter with her gaze alone. Cary attempted to defend his mom. &#34;Grandma, this isn&#39;t on her, it&#39;s all-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AlL what?&#34; Demi interjected sharply. &#34;Your mother has spoiled her children into blindness. And you, would you overlook it if Margot had been abducted by her sister-in-law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Certainly not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary was adamant-any threat to his sister would be met with fierce revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elora&#39;s tears flowed more freely, she pleaded,&#34;Demi, Margot is your own granddaughter! Can you really stand by while she rot in jail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi scoffed dismissively, &#34;Clearly, she needs to learn her lesson. Why else would she stoop so low against Evelina without provocation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Demi, don&#39;t worry about me. I&#39;m not really going to let Margot face jail time,&#34; Evelina interjected,choosing to appease Demi by offering Margot forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi looked at her with a mix of gratitude and sorrow.&#34;You&#39;re too kind, my dear, after all you&#39;ve endured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Elora was relentless, pressing Evelina to immediately formalize her forgiveness in writing. Infuriated by her daughter-in-law&#39;s audacity, Demi dismissed Elora from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Subsequently, Cary, seeking to soothe his mother,quickly followed Elora out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the room had quieted, Demi invited Evelina and lan to join her for coffee. She eyed lan thoughtfully before asking, &#34;You&#39;re not MMr. Russell,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi had her suspicions during lan&#39;s last visit; given her mild illness now, it was unlikely Jasper would have visited personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan acknowledged Demi&#39;s keen observation with a nod.&#34;Indeed, Mrs. Gibson, your perception is correct. I am lan Payne, Mr. Russell&#39;s aide. Ms. Marsh is a friend of Miss Russell, the latter specifically requested my assistance to escort Ms. Marsh here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon learning this, Demi&#39;s tension eased. &#34;It&#39;s no wonder;Evelina&#39;s reputation as an outstanding doctor and a person of integrity precedes her. It seems everyone she meets becomes a friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a stark contrast to her family&#39;s misjudgment of Esme, whom they valued as a gem despite her being nothing more than a counterfeit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, with a soft touch, grasped Demi&#39;s hand.&#34;Margot isn&#39;t inherently evil. My suspicion is that Esme  has orchestrated much of this trouble. You must watch out for her, Demi.&#34;	シ</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That thought has crossed my mind too!&#34; exclaimed Demi, one of the few in her family to remain discerning. She had already entertained the notion of Esme&#39;s deceit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she asked, &#34;When will Cary open his eyes to the truth and win you back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina merely bowed her head, sipping her coffee.One chaotic entanglement was more than enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Demi is clearly letting her imagination run wild,&#34;thought lan as he rolled his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they departed the Gibson residence, to their surprise, Cary awaited Evelina in the parking area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His approach was patronizing as usual. &#34;There&#39;s something I need to discuss with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, tired of endless disputes, saw this as an opening. Perhaps this was her chance to accompany him and finalize their divorce once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan made the prudent decision to wait in the car,respecting his boss&#39;s directive to guarantee Evelina&#39;s safe return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re transparent to me now,&#34; Cary replied, his  voice heavy with accusation. &#34;All your manipulations,your deceitful tactics-they&#39;re just a ploy to extract money. But | won&#39;t be fooled. The initial divorce terms are canceled. Whether you sign this or not,I&#39;m pushing forward with the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he threw a new set of divorce papers at Evelina before turning on his heel to depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This revised agreement stripped away all the financial benefits previously offered, leaving her with nothing.</p>
