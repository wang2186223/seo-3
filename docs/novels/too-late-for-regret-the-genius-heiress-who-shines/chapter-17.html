                <p>Evelina gave Kristina a light smack on the shoulder,clearly frustrated. &#34;I was actually kidnapped by Hayden Reid,a thug paid by Margot to kill me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina&#39;s face fell immediately, her earlier indignation vanishing. She awkwardly covered her face with her hand.&#34;Oh,so it wasn&#39;t Mr. Russell after all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina confirmed with a shake of her head. &#34;No, it definitely wasn&#39;t him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing her mistake, Kristina&#39;s posture slumped as she stood there, utterly embarrassed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But really, who could fault her for assuming? Evelina was untouchable in Aglonard, her abilities unparalleled.In Kristina&#39;s eyes, only someone like Jasper Russell could manage such a move, especially given the recent events-Evelina had just made a spectacle at the Dusk Lounge and vanished shortly thereafter,while Jasper had left in a noticeable fury..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had led to the belief that Jasper was responsible for Evelina&#39;s capture, sparing only Kristina and the owner of the club because he had Evelina to deal with. Kristina had painstakingly reviewed security footage and led her team on a frantic pursuit to this location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,the truth was out- Evelina&#39;s identity had been revealed. Jasper, visibly shocked, inquired, &#34;You were the last student mentored by Professor Mitchell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Jasper pondered, the clearer it became. &#34;It all adds up now. Cary&#39;s sight was restored thanks to you,wasn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina offered no denial. Given the reach of the Russell family, her true identity was bound to surface sooner rather than later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper,altering his tone, proposed a new beginning.&#34;Ms. Marsh, let&#39;s put our previous misunderstandings aside. I invite you to treat Florrie under any terms you find agreeable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His demeanor had softened, a stark contrast to the firm authority he wielded just moments before,underscoring his genuine concern for his niece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie,barely containing her excitement, chimed in,&#34;Really? Then just stake your claim on my uncle already! He won&#39;t resist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina pinched herself in disbelief. Indeed, there seemed to be an unspoken connection between Evelina and Jasper. Relieved to be recognized by her maiden name,Evelina pondered her next steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,she wasn&#39;t ready to commit to treating Florrie and sought a plausible delay. &#34;I apologize, Mr. Russell,but I suffered a blow to my back earlier. I need Kristina to assist me in dressing the wound.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Collecting some ointments from her kit, Evelina motioned for Kristina to follow her towards the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked away, Kristina mulled over the situation,still trying to piece everything together. &#34;I reviewed the security footage. Only two thugs attacked you.With your capabilities, even inebriated, you should have handled them easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I needed to find out who was behind this,&#34; Evelina said tersely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina&#39;s expression showed concern. &#34;You&#39;re not one to linger in dangerous situations. Did you learn what you needed quickly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| discovered there were two other girls captured. It seemed right to help them escape since I was already involved,&#34; Evelina explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they got into Kristina&#39;s car, Evelina removed her jacket and top, exposing a large, dark bruise across her back. Kristina inhaled sharply at the sight. &#34;That looks painful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s minor. Just fix it up for me,&#34; Evelina said,suppressing a grimace</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina&#39;s hands were less than delicate, causing Evelina to flinch from the discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,Florrie had overheard their conversation.Her voice shaky, she spoke up. &#34;Uncle, she&#39;s injured.She got hurt rescuing me and Eloise. She could have fled,but she chose to rescue us:&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plea continued. &#34;Please, don&#39;t treat her harshly.Don&#39;t force her to treat me. She&#39;s kind, and I believe she has good reasons for her decisions. Let&#39;s not put more on her shoulders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper gazed at her and then gave a slow nod.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, deep inside, he was resolute. He would not relinquish their only opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was determined to persuade Evelina to heal Florrie&#39;s vision, whatever the cost.</p>
