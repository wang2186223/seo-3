                <p>An eerie stillness gripped the luxurious hotel lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the gun pressed firmly against Evelina&#39;s forehead, Mara called out Jasper&#39;s name twice, her voice echoing-but he remained absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seems your precious Mr. Russell doesn&#39;t value you after all,&#34; Mara mocked bitterly. In a burst of fury, she fired a shot directly at Evelina&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t an act. The gun was loaded, and she was fully prepared to pull the trígger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullet shattered the polished marble, scattering fragments wildly. Hostages in the kitchen erupted in screams of terror, one even fainting from the shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Evelina responded with a laugh, &#34;I was nothing more than a passing distraction. What exactly did you think you&#39;d achieve by threatening him with my life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Jasper wasn&#39;t abandoning her; he was simply biding his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her role now was simply to stall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re just someone insignificant in his eyes?&#34; Mara sneered, clicking the hammer back. &#34;Guess it&#39;s time toend this nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina stood motionless, her eyes closing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No-don&#39;t shoot her!&#34; Cary&#39;s voice trembled as he spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara turned the gun toward him, amused contempt clear in her eyes. &#34;And who are you to her? Trying to be a hero now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s... she&#39;s my wife,&#34; Cary stammered, barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara&#39;s expression twisted mockingly. &#34;Your family won&#39;t mind handing over half a billion then, right?&#34; Cary faltered, clearly stunned by the number. &#34;Couldn&#39;t we maybe negotiate something lower?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny.&#34; Mara laughed scornfully. &#34;Didn&#39;t you just say she was your wife? Isn&#39;t she worth every penny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s hesitation was plain, disgust evident in his tone. &#34;We&#39;re divorcing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five hundred million? He wouldn&#39;t even offer half as much to rescue his first love,let alone Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sort of cash could buy him several new wives without batting an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning her venomous gaze to Evelina, Mara sneered, &#34;Pathetic. Your ex-husband won&#39;t pay, your lover won&#39;t appear. Why even bother keeping you alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words bit harshly,yet Evelina met them unflinchingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,her eyes flicked discreetly to Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She noticed something odd-a hint of triumph flashed briefly across Aurora&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most hostages facing death would tremble, terrified their captors might execute them regardless of ransom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Aurora? She actually dared to smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Mara&#39;s finger tightened on the trigger, Aurora&#39;s hidden satisfaction became clearer still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora clearly wanted Evelina out of the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on!&#34; lan&#39;s sharp voice cut through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes unwavering,he faced Mara directly. &#34;Five hundred million? My family will cover it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You?&#34; Mara laughed hesitantly, examining him skeptically. &#34;An assistant carrying around that much cash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet lan exuded an authority that he&#39;d clearly absorbed from his years beside Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Depends on who I assist. Mr. Russell doesn&#39;t just manage the Russell Group; he controls various international companies too. My family has significant shares in all of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In short, lan was far more than Jasper&#39;s mere assistant-he was his financial partner. Although not widely known in lreah, the Payne family&#39;s global investments were considerable. Even Kristina&#39;s illustrious family might not match up. lan&#39;s high-level connections added further weight to his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look at you. Didn&#39;t peg you for someone with that kind of cash,&#34; Mara sneered, thrown off just like everyone else in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Especially Cary,whose disbelief bordered on comical. Jasper&#39;s assistant casually pledging half a billion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly,Mara swung the gun, striking Evelina viciously with its butt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina turned swiftly, avoiding the worst, but stil felt the blow tear into her forehead, blood trickling down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shameless bitch!&#34; Mara shrieked furiously. &#34;Seducing Jasper wasn&#39;t enough- you had to go after his assistant,too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan&#39;s fists clenched impulsively, ready to retaliate, but Evelina&#39;s firm glance steadied him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara was baiting them into losing control. Reacting impulsively now would ruin Jasper&#39;s carefully orchestrated plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adopting Mara&#39;s earlier sneering tone, Evelina retorted sharply, &#34;Feeling insecure, Mara? Jealous someone&#39;s willing to shell out half a billion for me? Sounds like you speak from experience. How many buyers have you entertained for cash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina assessed Mara coolly, contempt lacing every word. &#34;Even if you stripped, no one would pay to look at someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sliced through Mara but were directed subtly toward Aurora.</p>
