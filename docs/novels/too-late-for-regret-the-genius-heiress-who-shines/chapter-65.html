                <p>Florrie concluded her explanation, and Dorothea immediately backed it up, highlighting the importance of Jasper&#39;s timely intervention. &#34;Without Mr. Russell&#39;s quick response, the prolonged exposure to the lime might have led to irreversible damage to Evelina&#39;s vision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb appeared completely drained, leaning heavily against the wall in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He began to cry, overwhelmed by guilt, and slapped himself in despair. &#34;This is all my fault...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his distress, Florrie and lan quickly came to help, each taking one of his hands. Florrie reassured him gently. &#34;This isn&#39;t your fault. These things were beyond our control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned he might do more harm to himself, she added, &#34;Evelina would be heartbroken to see you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan agreed and shifted their focus. &#34;Let&#39;s concentrate on uncovering who&#39;s really behind this and ensure they are held accountable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb bitterly mentioned Aurora, blaming her for the circumstances that led to Evelina being alone. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for her, Evelina wouldn&#39;t have been out there alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan linked the incidents back to Aurora, saying, &#34;The disputes over the orphanage land and the issues with Margot also lead back to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With all signs pointing to Aurora, it was hard to see it as mere coincidence. She was now the main suspect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina&#39;s coming out,&#34; Dorothea said, giving a quiet reminder as everyone quickly gathered, their faces filled with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was slowly wheeled out on a stretcher,visibly groggy from the anesthesia, her quiet presence drawing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper watched over Evelina with a furrowed brow,noticing her eyes remained shut. Florrie, with concern washing over her face, gently called out to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They moved Evelina carefully into a hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie, stay here with her and make sure she&#39;s not left alone,&#34; Jasper instructed, ensuring Dorothea was also attentive. &#34;Dorothea, look after her well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to lan, he instructed, &#34;Head to the orphanage and investigate the source of that powder switch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was confident that the culprit was still lurking around Petal Creek Orphanage, guarded by two of his bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll handle it, Mr. Russell.&#34; lan assured him promptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper then addressed Caleb, who was visibly distressed by Evelina&#39;s condition. &#34;Caleb, come with me.We need to deal with Aurora now.&#34; It was clear that all trails led to Aurora, and it was time they sought some direct answers from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; Encouraged by Jasper&#39;s initiative, Caleb brushed away his tears and followed Jasper determinedly to where Aurora was recovering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s personal bodyguard sensed Jasper&#39;s forceful approach and tried to prevent any escalation by moving to inform Aurora. However, he was swiftly restrained by Jasper&#39;s own guards before he could alert her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Caleb made a move to enter, he halted at the sound of Aurora&#39;s voice, outraged. &#34;What did you just say? How could you be so harmful?&#34; she said to someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper subtly restrained Caleb, signaling him to hold off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,they heard Aurora&#39;s assistant confess through shaky sobs, saying, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Marsh. It wasn&#39;t my intention to harm Evelina directly. It just upset me to see her close to Mr. Russell, and I thought a scare might shift the balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora responded sharply, &#34;You&#39;ve gone too far!Jasper&#39;s feelings for me are non-existent, why involve Evelina? She&#39;s not the reason Jasper won&#39;t marry me. Now, be honest-did Grandma tell you to go after her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice broke into a weak cough, illustrating her fragile state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant, overwhelmed by guilt and fear, broke down. &#34;Please, Miss Marsh, forgive me. I realize the error of my ways, and it won&#39;t happen again-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you get another chance? You&#39;ve already gone too far, isn&#39;t that obvious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, infuriated, halted her words to manage a cough, then replied deliberately, &#34;You need to admit your actions to Jasper. And I... I will make an apology to Evelina on your behalf...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, Miss Marsh! If Mr. Russell learns I hurt Evelina,my life will be over. After all these years by your side, please show some compassion-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant&#39;s plea was cut short as Caleb, filled with rage, stormed into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was your doing, Aurora! Your assistant hurt Evelina. I overheard everything. What more can you say now? You despicable person!&#34;</p>
