                <p>&#34;From the instant the aircraft encountered technical issues, forcing an unplanned touchdown in Eastmere,&#34;Evelina replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After examining the cockpit&#39;s damaged structure, Evelina determined it was no accident-someone wanted them grounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Jasper organized aerial extraction, she urged him to put alternative contingencies in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Russell Group had no presence in Eastmere, but it had gained a foothold in the surrounding metropolitan hubs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper studied the chart and summoned reinforcements from multiple nearby regions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them were troops he once led, along with physicians and elite investigators.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the pair waited at the local airport, these units quietly made their entrance into the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When weather or interference prevented the helicopter&#39;s arrival, they were forced to stay overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The support teams shadowed them discreetly to their lodging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they met Aurora, lan surreptitiously transmitted the building&#39;s blueprint to their allies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Jasper reached his quarters, he initiated contact to finalize plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The quartet of protectors accompanying him and lan also took the opportunity to assess the premises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was then they identified intruders who had blended in under the guise of hotel employees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After this discovery, Evelina and Jasper rested, preparing themselves for what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambush played out exactly as Jasper had foreseen. Had Aurora not caused a delay, Evelina would have escaped capture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with few options, Jasper had to open dialogue with the abductors to keep her alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she remained free, the conflict would have ended in mere minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a masterpoiece of manipulation,&#34; Mara said with a bitter smile, eyes gleaming with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her spirit remained unbroken. &#34;How did my cousin perish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You led him to his end,&#34; Evelina answered flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With lethal intent, Mara had ordered her cousin and two others to torch the guests she deemed disposable in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jasper&#39;s operatives were lyng in ambush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They extracted the civilians, neutralized the attackers, and assumed their identities with masks and uniforms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mara&#39;s cousin had sustained fatal injuries already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jasper&#39;s men retrieved him, he lacked the strength to expose the truth-and succumbed shortly afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consumed by mourning, Mara never questioned the impostors&#39; legitimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They gave Evelina the signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their journey, Jasper had taught her subtle hand signs to recognize allies and communicate silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That&#39;s how Evelina knew she could lunge at the guns without fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The firearm discharged, but the, projectiles were rubber, and the&#34;blood&#34; that spilled was from a hidden pack handed to her in advance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fluorescent powder, inconspicuously applied by the disguised agents, marked the true enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the lights cut out, they lit up like targets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mara, I know you have people you care about,&#34; Jasper said, giving her a final opportunity. &#34;Name the mastermind, and your family walks free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll speak,&#34; she agreed abruptly,&#34;but only to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper gave space, and Evelina stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Burn in hell!&#34; Mara shrieked, lunging to tear at Evelina&#39;s ear with her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move!&#34; Jasper yelled, kicking Mara off the stretcher. She struck the floor hard-and didn&#39;t get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper caught Evelina, his voice tense with worry. &#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she whispered, understanding that Mara had chosen death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she survived, those behind the plot would have come for her loved ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina looked past Jasper, eyes locking on Aurora, who stood weeping with suspicious innocence. &#34;Mara...how could you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina stepped closer, her gaze sharp as blades. &#34;First, it was your personal assistant, then your bodyguard.Who will be the next to die?&#34;</p>
