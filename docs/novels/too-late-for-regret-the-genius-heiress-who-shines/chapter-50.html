                <p>Esme&#39;s complexion drained in an instant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the Sight Weaver plotting? After pocketing such a hefty sum from her, was she really intent on pushing her over the edge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t this too much? Do you think I won&#39;t retaliate if you keep behaving so disgracefully?&#34; Fury erupted within Esme as she shouted, fully aware that the Sight Weaver was in the crowd, listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme Barton!&#34; Dorothea&#39;s voice rang out sharply. &#34;If you truly are the Sight Weaver, then prove it by performing this surgery.Otherwise, leave at once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, Esme refused to acknowledge it. &#34;Shut your mouth! Of course, I am-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A fraud! Someone who couldn&#39;t even secure a place in Mr. Mitchell&#39;s graduate program dares to claim they were his student? Have you ever even wieldeda scalpel? What gives you the right to stand in this operating room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina pulled down her mask, revealing her face as she glared at Esme. Her voice was icy.&#34;Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;How can it be you? This is impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina smirked. &#34;Didn&#39;t you try to get close to me over the phone? Strange how you don&#39;t recognize me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! That can&#39;t boe! You never even attended college. How could you be Landen&#39;s student?&#34; Esme screeched, panic setting in. &#34;She&#39;s the liar! You&#39;ve all been tricked!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical staff cast her disdainful looks, as if she were nothing more than a spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea scoffed. &#34;While I was assisting Ms. Marsh in surgeries, you were out partying, chasing after the heir of the wealthiest family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After assisting Evelina with Cary&#39;s final surgery, Dorothea took a few days off to relax abroad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nightclubs there were famous, and she had gone with friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when she spotted Esme, desperately trying to charm the local tycoon&#39;s son by performing a provocative dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary had naively believed Esme returned for him, when in reality, the wealthy heir had discarded her and married the daughter of an influential politician.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t come back out of love-her schemes abroad had failed, leaving her no choice but to try her luck with Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Cary had any sense, he&#39;d check immigration records and see that you hadn&#39;t stepped foot in this country for three years. How could you have operated on him while being absent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea&#39;s words shattered the last remnants of Esme&#39;s composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since returning, she had relished Cary&#39;s attention, nearly forgetting the shame she had endured overseas.Why bring it all back now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Madness took hold. Grabbing a scalpel, she lunged at Evelina, shrieking, &#34;If I can&#39;t have peace, neither can you.Die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s first instinct was to dodge, but doing so would leave Florrie vulnerable to Esme&#39;s blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let that happen. Instead, she braced herself, preparing to wrest the weapon away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the last second, a figure appeared, yanking her aside and delivering a brutal kick to Esme&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aah!&#34; Esme cried out as she hit the floor, the scalpel clattering beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that she seemed to register what she had just done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I-It wasn&#39;t me! | didn&#39;t do anything!&#34; she wailed, gripping her head. Attempting to flee, she barely made it past the doorway before the Russell family&#39;s bodyguards seized her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright? Did she hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person who had stepped in was none other than Jasper. Concern filled his face as he held Evelina close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently thanked his instincts for staying near the door, keeping watch. If he had left, Evelina might have been seriously injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m okay, Jasper,&#34; Evelina murmured, shaken. Guilt crept into her voice. &#34;I should have never let Esme in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t on you. You didn&#39;t expect her to snap like that. That woman clearly has deep-seated issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper placed his hands on her shoulders, steadying her. &#34;Stay strong, Evelina. I trust you to handle Florrie.Leave the rest to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief washed over Evelina as she straightened. &#34;I won&#39;t let you down,Jasper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Jasper departed, and the surgery commenced.</p>
