                <p>&#34;Mr. Cortez, the earrings you&#39;re after already belong to someone else,&#34; Evelina said firmly, meeting his gaze.&#34;Perhaps you&#39;d prefer anotheritem, or I can simply transfer three hundred million directly to your account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing the Ghost Market&#39;s customs, Evelina was fully aware that rejecting Idris outright would jeopardize her future dealings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, she&#39;d rather settle the hefty price without negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris blinked, momentarily caught off guard. &#34;I hadn&#39;t realized you had such deep pockets, Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under normal circumstances, he might have considered the generous offer, but after today&#39;s embarrassment, his pride wouldn&#39;t let him back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The earrings are special,&#34; Idris insisted, feigning sincerity. &#34;They&#39;re a birthday gift for my daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Careful not to offend Jasper, he softened his tone. &#34;If you can&#39;t make this happen, I&#39;m afraid the Ghost Market can no longer serve your requests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; Evelina interjected quickly, sensing Jasper was about to intervene once more-she&#39;d already burdened him enough today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly added a caution. &#34;However, Miss Barton recently acquired the earrings and might be reluctant to part with them. I&#39;ll need some extra time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, seeing a possible advantage, began calculating again, only for Jasper&#39;s cold reminder to interrupt sharply, &#34;Speaking of timing, have you settled your debts yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s words were unmistakably a veiled threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever deadline Idris set for Evelina, Jasper would surely impose the same for ldris&#39;s repayment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris reluctantly said, &#34;My daughter&#39;s birthday is the seventeenth next month. I trust you&#39;ll deliver by then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This provided Evelina with three weeks to negotiate the earrings from Esme, and she immediately agreed.&#34;Consider it settled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris stormed off, his frustration evident, leaving behind disappointed onlookers who had hoped to gain his favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina,&#34; Jasper said gently. &#34;You didn&#39;t need to accept so hastily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s okay, Jasper.&#34; She reassured him confidently. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t have agreed if I didn&#39;t have a backup plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression softened, gratitude clearly visible. &#34;I truly appreciate your support today. Without you, I can&#39;t imagine how difficult things would have been.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing wasn&#39;t the real issue-it was the thought of enduring Idris&#39;s unwanted advances for an entire month that unsettled her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps she&#39;d been overly confident three years ago, thinking failure impossible, only to face heartbreak in her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need for thanks; helping each other is what friends do-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper was interrupted as Evelina&#39;s phone rang unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb appeared onscreen in a video call, visibly concerned from the airport.&#34;1&#34;mn so sorry, Evelina. Did you lose? If the Ghost Market falls through, I canstill help you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lose?&#34; Florrie, overhearing Caleb, jumped in immediately. &#34;Uncle Jasper helped Evelina win!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How is that possible?&#34; Caleb&#39;s expression shifted; skeptical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d reluctantly left when Evelina needed him most, and now Jasper had somehow conveniently saved the day--it all felt suspiciously orchestrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why not?&#34; Florrie retorted defensively. &#34;Your.poor shooting doesn&#39;t mean Uncle Jasper can&#39;t excel-he was a military sharpshooter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eagerly praised Jasper, effectively silencing Caleb and raising Jasper&#39;s stature in Evelina&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper was on a whole other level-there was no way Caleb could measure up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just showing off!&#34; Caleb retorted at Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina smiled quietly, amused by their playful banter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie proudly ended the call, satisfied with her victory, her earlier anxiety about the upcoming surgery nearly forgotten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle Jasper, you were incredible today! Can you teach me shooting after my eyes recover?&#34; she pleaded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely,&#34; Jasper answered warmly, grateful for his niece&#39;s lively defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about you, Evelina? Interested in learning?&#34; he asked, suddenly turning her way with a look that carried more weight than the words alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course she wants to,&#34; Florrie replied swiftly, preventing any refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleverly added, &#34;But I&#39;d rather not train alongside Evelina. She masters everything-medicine,combat,shooting. It would be intimidating. I&#39;d prefer private sessions with Uncle Jasper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Florrie wasn&#39;t about to become a third wheel during Jasper&#39;s precious alone time with Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clever girl.&#34; Jasper praised affectionately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Evelina&#39;s distraction, Jasper gently said, &#34;With Mr. Quinn leaving, shall I recommend a reliable divorce lawyer for you?</p>
