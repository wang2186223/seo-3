                <p>Evelina&#39;s eyes fluttered open to the late morning light filtering through the curtains. She glanced around, her heart pounding,as she saw Kristina, Florrie,and Jasper gathered by her bedside. Overwhelmed, she closed her eyes once more, hoping she was still dreaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kristina&#39;s voice broke through her denial. &#34;Evi,you&#39;re giving us a real fright, you know?&#34; she scolded gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With resignation, Evelina opened her eyes again.&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina, clearly frustrated, recounted the events. &#34;I warned you the other night to get that injury checked at the hospital. But no, you insisted it was nothing serious,&#34; she scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Softening her tone, she continued, &#34;Then yesterday,you collapse! Thank goodness Jasper was there because of Florrie.Imagine if I had found you a long time after you&#39;d taken the wrong medication... I don&#39;t even want to think about what could&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The worry in Kristina&#39;s voice was evident, and she seemed close to tears. Attempting to offer some comfort, Evelina reached out to her friend, momentarily forgetting the IV needle in her hand. A sharp pain reminded her,snapping her fully to alertness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina glanced up at Jasper, a hint of surprise in her voice. &#34;You were the one who brought me here?&#34; she asked, attempting to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s hand pressed gently against her shoulder,easing her back onto the pillow. &#34;I didn&#39;t stop to get your consent,&#34; he responded with a calm demeanor.&#34;Apologies for the abruptness of it all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie interjected with a sense of urgency in her voice,&#34;It was really scary yesterday. Luckily, my uncle was there to carry you to safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina, ever observant, caught on to the new information. &#34;Hold on-Jasper carried Evi out himself?&#34;she asked, surprised. &#34;I assumed lan was the one who did it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Jasper, the act had been nothing more than necessary intervention, hardly something to dwell on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, noticing Evelina&#39;s cheeks tint with a soft blush brought back a vivid memory of her close against him,her warmth mingling with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He averted his gaze, his jaw set firm. Meanwhile, Florrie, ever cheerful and unaware of the undercurrents, added brightly, &#34;He sure did! Evi, you saved my life, so it was only right for my uncle to look after you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for Evelina&#39;s hand, her voice earnest.&#34;You&#39;re not very good at looking after yourself, are you? Now that you&#39;re here,you should stay for a few more days. I mean it, or I&#39;ll really start crying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina added, &#34;Really, Evi, you should stay. I&#39;m leaving town for my granddad&#39;s birthday and won&#39;t be back for a few days. I&#39;d worry too much if you were alone in your hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was ready to decline, but at that moment,a servant entered the room. &#34;Mr. Russell, Miss Barton has arrived and is requesting to examine Miss Russell&#39;s eyes in detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Esme Barton&#39;s name made Evelina reconsider her initial refusal. If Esme was still posing as Landen&#39;s final student, Evelina felt compelled to intervene.&#34;Okay,&#34; she replied reluctantly. &#34;I&#39;ll stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie couldn&#39;t contain her excitement and threw her hands up joyfully. &#34;Yes! You&#39;re awesome, Evi!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the servant escorted Florrie to meet Esme,Kristina hurried to leave for her flight. This left Evelina in a suddenly quiet room with Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence that followed was heavy, making Evelina&#39;s heart race slightly. After what felt like a long time,she finally said, &#34;Thank you... for saving me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t often Evelina found herself being rescued-only once before had anyone stepped in on her behalf,when Demi Gibson had intervened to save her childhood home, the Petal Creek Orphanage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper replied with his usual composure, &#34;You&#39;re welcome.&#34; As he observed her there, so pale and weary in the large bed, she appeared even more fragile. The bed seemed to swallow her small frame,enhancing her vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reflecting on how this delicate figure had single-handedly fought off attackers just nights ago seemed almost unimaginable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was like her-a person who genuinely deserved protection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper spoke again after a brief pause. &#34;I didn&#39;t take you here just to treat Florrie&#39;s eyes. Feel free to rest.That&#39;s really all there is to it. Florrie enjoys your company; it makes her happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina acknowledged his statement but quickly grew solemn. &#34;I&#39;mn open to treating Florrie. However, Esme must make a public apology. She misrepresented herself using my professional reputation and my  mentor&#39;s name for fraud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She often thought about her absence during Landen&#39;s final days-a regret that still stung deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allowing someone to tarnish her mentor&#39;s reputation was something she could not stand for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Jasper replied promptly, ready to agree to her terms. &#34;Anything you ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was willing to meet all her demands if it meant securing her help for Florrie&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he left the room, Jasper paused at the door and said, &#34;One more thing-Margot has been arrested.And Cary...well,he&#39;s aware that you reported her.Now he&#39;s scouring the city for you.&#34;</p>
