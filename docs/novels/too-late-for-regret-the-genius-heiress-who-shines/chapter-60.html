            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Evelina stood silently, her eyes sharp as daggers fixed upon Esme, radiating dominance without uttering a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under Evelina&#39;s intense scrutiny, Esme sat rigidly, barely daring to breathe, her knuckles pale from gripping the chair&#39;s armrests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy, oppressive silence lingered, thickening the tension in the air..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme finally cracked, her forehead glistening with nervous sweat. Unable to withstand the pressure any longer,she shifted uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, get on with it-what are your three demands?&#34; Evelina demanded, slicing through the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s assistant had guessed correctly: Evelina&#39;s compassion was her greatest vulnerability, and she wouldn&#39;t forsake hundreds of innocent orphans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It didn&#39;t have to be this difficult,&#34; Esme said smugly, believing she&#39;d finally gained the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina leaned closer, eyes glittering dangerously. &#34;If you dare push this too far, Esme, that fifty million you invested will evaporate. And believe me, the Russell family won&#39;t hesitate to make your life miserable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Evelina chose compromise, her threat was far from empty. She held enough influence to make Esme regret her actions deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quit trying to intimidate me!&#34; Esme spat, her voice shaking despite her defiant stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not bluffing. I pushed Aurora so hard she passed out, and the Marsh family still can&#39;t touch me-because I&#39;ve got the Russell famnily behind me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Esme had suddenly grown a backbone and a sharp mind overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d clearly found a weak spot in the orphanage and used it well, which meant someone powerful had to be pulling the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Aurora had the money and influence to go head-to-head with Evelina. Everything Evelina said was meant to push Esme, to see how she&#39;d react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme stumbled, failing Evelina&#39;s test spectacularly. &#34;You&#39;re deluded! Ms. Marsh is engaged to Jasper Russell. If you upset her, the Russell family will crush you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Esme paled considerably. Clearly, if the Russell family had intended to crush Evelina, the woman wouldn&#39;t be standing confidently before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina scoffed at Esme&#39;s foolishness, &#34;Did Aurora feed you that line? You&#39;ve been tricked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s thoughts were a whirlwind, yet she managed to steady herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of whether Aurora had deceived her, Esme knew she had to maintain her stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Firstly, repairing my relationship with Cary is essential. Thus, it&#39;s crucial that I be the one to save Margot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme aimed to claim the credit for rescuing Margot, although the real effort would have to come from Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Evelina answered, hoping Cary and Esme would keep their problems to themselves and not bother others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Secondly, I require that the Russell family fully absolve me of my deceit and not implicate the Gibson family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina paused before reluctantly saying, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She considered Demi&#39;s advancing age and preferred not to burden her with the Gibson family&#39;s issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thirdly, I refuse to make a public apology at Landen&#39;s grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s out of the question!&#34; Evelina interjected before she could continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll provide you with a list of those impersonating you; isn&#39;t that sufficient? If you&#39;re that bored, chase them down!&#34; Esme retorted in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need your list to locate them. Both they and you will face consequences. That&#39;s final!&#34; Evelina said firmly, making it clear there was no room for negotiation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme had no other options left, so she replied, &#34;Okay, I&#39;Il apologize in private, but I won&#39;t go public in front of the media.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was resolute. &#34;No, that&#39;s not acceptable. We can&#39;t negotiate on this. Incompetent doctors cause harm,and those who fake their credentials must face public consequJences.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you have to be so difficult?&#34; Esme exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme then adjusted her demand. &#34;I secured the land rights for fifty million. You&#39;ll need to buy them back from me for one hundred million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added shamelessly, &#34;Including the twenty million you took from me before, that makes one hundred and twenty million in total. Pay up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this just about the money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, who had never entered a bad deal except during her brief marriage, wasn&#39;t bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Evelina responded. &#34;You&#39;ll handle Cary&#39;s twenty million surgery fees. Plus, I&#39;ll sell you the video of you faking surgery for fifty million. Sounds fair,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, Evelina would only need to pay Esme fifty million, rendering her an ineffective broker who made no profit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething with rage, Esme picked up a thermos from the desk and hurled it at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina caught the thermos with ease and unscrewed the cap, dousing Esme&#39;s hand with the hot water from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme screamed in pain, &#34;Ah! It burns!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly replacing the thermos on the desk, Evelina&#39;s face was stern. &#34;You need to settle your debt with Kamryn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the water wasn&#39;t as hot as what Esme had inflicted on Kamryn, pride prevented Esme from admitting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reconsidering her stance, Esme said angrily, &#34;Forget ourdeal. I&#39;m evicting all the orphans immediately!&#34;</p>
