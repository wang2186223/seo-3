                <p>Evelina could hardly believe what she was hearing from Cary. &#34;What&#39;s the stock price of Gibson Group got to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina, clearly disgusted, retorted, &#34;You strip your ex-wife of everything and still expect her to solve your company&#39;s problems? I&#39;ve never encountered anyone as shameless as you! Florrie, can you believe this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie responded with a firm, &#34;Never seen it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t mince words, adding, &#34;Absolutely despicable! A real loser!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary was left fuming, at a loss for words, when Margot emerged from the vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d arrived in the same car as Esme and Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stayed inside for a while, all because Esme had said, &#34;Ms. Marsh was Cary&#39;s wife for three years.This is their business-he should be the one to deal with it. I believe in him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing her brother being outnumbered and scolded by several women, Margot felt compelled to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nonsense!&#34; she shouted at Evelina. &#34;For three years, you lived at our expense, and now you&#39;re meddling with the Gibson stock through this divorce drama. It&#39;s your mess, and you&#39;re fully accountable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Kristina was about to explode, Evelina restrained her, giving Margot a chilling stare. &#34;Exactly how do you suggest | &#39;take responsibility&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, sensing Evelina&#39;s distance, smirked triumphantly. &#34;You need to publicly confess at a press conference that it was your infidelity that caused the divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina burst into laughter, her reaction so genuine it filled the air. &#34;Hahaha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, perplexed and irritated, said, &#34;Why are you laughing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having a brain is necessary. Shame you seem to lack one,&#34; Kristina said between chuckles. &#34;Accusing Evelina of cheating when your own brother parades his mistress about? That&#39;s gold. Maybe a bit more time behind bars would do you good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, feeling deeply insulted, raised her hand in a flash of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had reacted swiftly, delivering a firm slap to Margot&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot was taken aback, her hand frozen mid-air,disbelief written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the car, Esme had been observing quietly but now she intervened, stepping out rapidly. &#34;Ms.Marsh! This is unacceptable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It finally sank in for Margot-she&#39;d just been slapped by the one person she hated most, and right in front of a crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury exploded inside her as she lunged at Evelina,ready to rip the latter to pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Evelina didn&#39;t flinch. She stepped in, yanked Margot by the hair, and landed several sharp slaps in a row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme was slapped by Evelina as well, which took her by surprise and left her crying as she stumbled into Cary&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary, cradling Esme, yelled at Evelina, &#34;Have you lost your mind,Evelina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, maintaining her grip on Margot&#39;s hair,retorted, &#34;Lost my mind? It seems you&#39;re the ones who are completely out of touch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot was immobilized, wincing at even the slightest tug on her scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina, meanwhile, protected Florrie, thoroughly entertained by the unfolding drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With undeniable assertiveness, Evelina said, &#34;Margot orchestrated my kidnapping with Hayden and his crew. I held back on pressing charges out of respect for Demi, but these slaps? They&#39;re long overdue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked harder on Margot&#39;s hair, forcing the latter to meet her gaze. &#34;Remember to keep it polite whenever you see me, Margot. I can revoke my forgiveness any day, and without my goodwill,you could be facing a cell again. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Margot&#39;s face as she frantically blinked to indicate her understanding, unable to nod due to the pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Evelina released her, wiping her hands as if she had touched something horrible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, not one to concede defeat easily, lunged at Evelina once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out!&#34; Kristina, just as she was passing a tissue to Evelina, spotted Margot&#39;s underhanded move and cried out in warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quick reflexes, Evelina dodged backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to halt her momentum, Margot stumbled and landed face-first on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margot!&#34; Esme, full of worry, rushed to assist her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning from the fallen Margot, Evelina then fixedher gaze on Esme. &#34;Miss Barton, did you orchestrate this day&#39;s events?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme shook her head vigorously, stammering,&#34;I have no idea what you mean!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina scoffed, &#34;Clearly, it&#39;s obvious who gains the most from leaking the divorce, right? Are you planning to marry Cary next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Esme felt her pulse race, her scheme laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, it was Esme who had spread the news of the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard she tried, she knew she could never be that pure, perfect first love in his heart again. Her place in his heart wasn&#39;t what it used to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, she was desperate to secure her position by marrying Cary at the earliest opportunity.</p>
