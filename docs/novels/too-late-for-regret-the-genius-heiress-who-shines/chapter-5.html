                <p>&#34;Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?&#34; Margot immediately protested,indignation coloring her voice.&#34;She&#39;s nobody-just some orphan without parents-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot&#39;s rant was swiftly silenced by Demi&#39;s piercing glare,causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. &#34;Demi, Cary is your own grandson...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, &#34;I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let&#39;s see how deep his pockets run.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary-if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she&#39;d undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who&#39;d stick by him through hardships.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muscles tense, Cary&#39;s jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, &#34;Satisfied now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi&#39;s fierce support,she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would&#39;ve already walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am-Ma&#39;am!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room,gasping for breath. &#34;Mr. Russell... hne&#39;s arrived!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring him in.&#34; Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over herself. &#34;Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. &#34;You&#39;re stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless-&#34; Her thoughts darkened instantly,wishing fervently Evelina wasn&#39;t present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said,expecting an important guest. Shouldn&#39;t you discreetly leave through the back entrance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. &#34;Thanks for reminding me. Actually,Cary and I haven&#39;t officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I&#39;m still his wife-a rightful member of this family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary&#39;s chest. &#34;But Miss Barton here... she&#39;s merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you!&#34; Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. &#34;Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr.Russell came specifically for Esme. She&#39;s exceptional -the only one skilled enough to restore his niece&#39;s eyesight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words halted Demi&#39;s departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. &#34;Who did you say could cure blindness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme,&#34; Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride.&#34;Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell-she even cured me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Demi finally got it-why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly,she wouldn&#39;t blame her one bit. &#34;Esme, is this true?&#34; Demi&#39;s tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to meet Demi&#39;s piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cary,unaware, kept lauding Esme&#39;s supposed talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in,elevating her to almost mythical status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. &#34;Seems I&#39;ve arrived at the perfect moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. &#34;Mr. Russell,you&#39;re finally here-we&#39;ve been waiting eagerly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she&#39;d never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous,nearly stumbled in her eagerness. Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment,stopping purposefully in front of Esme. &#34;You&#39;re the renowned Sight Weaver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell&#39;s caliber-there was absolutely no room for error.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I apologize,&#34; Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. &#34;My dress got stained. I need to change immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Evelina&#39;s composed voice stopped her cold.&#34;Miss Barton,surely you&#39;re not running away already?Could it be because you&#39;re pretending to be Professor Mitchell&#39;s student?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like Cary,she could have him-no one was stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,shamelessly exploiting her mentor&#39;s reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nonsense!&#34; Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. &#34;I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh?&#34; Evelina&#39;s soft smile was deceptively gentle. &#34;If that&#39;s true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had personally conducted three major surgeries,alongside one subtle corrective procedure she&#39;d never publicly mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied,&#34;Three, obviously.I performed each myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying.&#34; Demi&#39;s voice sliced sharply through the air. &#34;It was four.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself,saying,&#34;R-right,four! Of course it was four.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make up your mind, Esme-was it three surgeries or four?&#34; Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.</p>
