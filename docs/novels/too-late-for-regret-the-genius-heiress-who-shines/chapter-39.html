                <p>&#34;Jasper, place a bet for me as well. I&#39;m betting on myself,&#34; Evelina said confidently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled gratefully at Jasper for his support, which only added to the tension Idris was feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more united Jasper and Evelina appeared, the more intimidated Idris became. He knew better than to mess with someone backed by the Russell family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s check the firearms, Evelina,&#34; Caleb suggested with a hint of annoyance, noticing Jasper&#39;s subtle flirtation, as he led her towards the shooting area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shooting range was effectively isolated from the spectators by dual layers of robust tempered glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering,Evelina noticed Florrie&#39;s excited waves from the viewing area. Her spirits lifted, and she responded by forming a heart shape with her arms above her head, directed at Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Florrie couldn&#39;t clearly see the gesture,Jasper, seated next to her, would undoubtedly describe it. Florrie mirrored the gesture with delight, sending a heart back to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Marsh, you really know how to work the game,getting close to Mr. Russell like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris stood off to the side, watching Evelina with the Russell family, jealousy eating away at him. His tone turned bitter as he asked, &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve already become his woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb reacted fiercely. &#34;Mind your language! It&#39;s Jasper who&#39;s pursuing her, not the other way around.Evelina hasn&#39;t consented to anything yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear,&#34; Idris responded with a smirk,still hopeful about being Evelina&#39;s first choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still aiming to be the first man to win Evelina&#39;s favor, given that Jasper hadn&#39;t yet succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the stands, Jasper watched the scene unfold with folded arms. Then he turned to face lan with a half-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan, sensing something was amiss, touched his own face anxiously. &#34;Is there something wrong with my face,Mr.Russell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper responded with a dismissive chuckle, &#34;Seems like you&#39;re ready to leave this place. Perhaps a trip abroad would suit you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down lan&#39;s spine as he quickly replied,&#34;Mr. Russell, I&#39;m on top of the task you assigned! We still have an hour before the deadline you set. I assure you,that individual will no longer be a problem very soon.&#34; lan stood to make a crucial phone call,accelerating the efforts back in Ireah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper had explicitly given lan three days to resolve a serious issue or face relocation abroad. lan knew better than to neglect such a significantresponsibility</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the shooting range, the four competitors finished checking their firearms and took a few practice shots to prepare for the upcoming challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The competitors were assigned randomly for each matchup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first one pitted Evelina directly against ldris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Marsh, have you checked the odds they&#39;re giving outside? It seems Mr. Russell is your only supporter.It&#39;s been a long time since your last big win.&#34; Idris angered Evelina. &#34;And with your recent time as a nanny,I doubt you&#39;ve kept up with your shooting. Why not concede now? You&#39;re just in this for your parents,right? Lose gracefully, and I&#39;ll still help you find them -if you agree to be my girlfriend.&#34; Evelina&#39;s response was swift- a sharp, defining gunshot that interrupted Idris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at him with clear disdain as he hastily retaliated with a shot of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up in the stands, Florrie couldn&#39;t contain her excitement, asking Jasper, &#34;Has Evelina won?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcer soon made the call. &#34;Ms. Marsh scores a perfect ten, Mr. Cortez, nine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s excitement peaked, and she tried to jump up,but Jasper gently urged her to sit back down. &#34;Stay put,there are still two rounds to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie,ever the cheerleader,beamed with confidence.&#34;Evelina&#39;s going to sweep the rest too!&#34; she said,already proud of her champion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina lined up her second shot, Idris unexpectedly let off his round early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This unexpected move caused Evelina&#39;s hand to tremble, resulting in an eight-ring hit, while Idris matched his previous score of nine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now even, the tension rose as they readied for the final,crucial shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go Evelina! You&#39;re the best!&#34; Florrie&#39;s voice rang out as she stood to cheer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The encouragement strengthened Evelina, who paused to draw a couple of deep breaths, dispelling her prior shot&#39;s disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Jasper&#39;s eye through the glass, she found him smiling encouragingly, a silent nod reigniting her resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gun and locked her sights right on the target&#39;s center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, smug from his earlier deceit, boasted once more before the final round. &#34;Ms. Marsh, just so you know,because I fancy you-forget about Mr. Russell. He&#39;s engaged to Aurora Marsh, the Marsh family heiress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boom!Boom!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their shots rang out in quick succession.</p>
