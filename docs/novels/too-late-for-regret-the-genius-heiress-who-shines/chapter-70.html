                <p>&#34;Stop hiding now, Jazmine. Mommy can&#39;t seem to find you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed only in a delicate nightgown and barefooted,Vivienne was a sight of distress in the large living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tears rolling down her cheeks, she pleaded,&#34;Jazmine, where are you, darling? Mommy really needs you to come out now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Vivienne!&#34; Franklin swiftly approached, wrapping her gently in a warm blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivienne said, &#34;Dear, our daughter is missing. She&#39;s been taken by someone. Shh-&#34; Vivienne pressed a finger to her lips. &#34;Do you hear that? She&#39;s crying,she won&#39;t stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with guilt, she sobbed. &#34;This is all my fault. I should&#39;ve kept her close!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tormented, she continued, &#34;They must have hidden her somewhere dark and cold. She&#39;s too small, she might not survive. We have to find her, we must find her right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivienne grabbed Franklin&#39;s hand, pleading with him to help her look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had no other option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin instructed the servants to fetch a doll, a perfect imitation of young Jazmine, and handed.it to Vivienne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This doll wore Jazmine&#39;s old clothes and carried her scent, which Vivienne instantly recognized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With great joy, Vivienne embraced the doll,pressing it close to her. &#34;Jazmine, my sweet girl, Mommy&#39;s bringing you home now...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin&#39;s focus remained on caring for his sick wife,leaving no room to contend with his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vivienne&#39;s life had been marred by profound guilt and grief since Jazmine vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plagued by sleepless nights and severe depression,she eventually suffered a breakdown. Though treatment brought some improvement, she still struggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On days like Jazmine&#39;s birthday or the anniversary of her disappearance, mentioning her name could trigger Vivienne into a desperate search for her daughter, as if reliving the tragedy again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This happens every year, like a relentless curse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Franklin escorted Vivienne upstairs to rest, Ady watched with a sharp gaze, thumping her cane in irritation before she departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chose solitude, living away from her family in the vast Marsh estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Ady even reached home, she called Aurora,who was still in Aglonard. &#34;What a disaster you&#39;ve created-it&#39;s beyond repair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apologies came quickly from Aurora. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Grandma. I secreted my assistant&#39;s sister in your home...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora had orchestrated the entire scheme,yet Ady was the one facing the consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady wasn&#39;t bothered about taking the blame,her focus was solely on the outcome. &#34;Aurora,how often must I remind you? If you&#39;re going to take action,ensure your success is guaranteed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s impulsive actions included targeting a person under Jasper &#39;s protection without a thorough plan, which inevitably led to her plans unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Grandma,&#34; Aurora cried into the phone. &#34;I never imagined Jasper would become so attached to Evelina, who seems so insignificant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, in her desperation, allowed Ady to shoulder the blame and pushed her assistant towards a breakdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Jasper remained relentless, forwarding all evidence to the Marsh family and seeking accountability for Evelina&#39;s ordeal. &#34;Now you&#39;re filled with regret, but you should be planning your next move,&#34; Ady scolded her for her naivety. &#34;You, don&#39;t understand your own position.Even if Jasper shows interest in her, it&#39;s merely fleeting. In matters of marriage, family background dictates the terms.&#34; After her scolding, Ady offered Aurora some guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Franklin had managed to soothe Vivienne into sleep and was feeling both physically and emotionally spent, Aurora&#39;s call came through. He listened as she immediately burst into tears,apologizing and blaming herself for not managing her assistant properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora pledged to rectify the situation and to provide financial support for her assistant&#39;s sister, ensuring the child would not have to worry about her future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, financial support and adoption were two very different commitments. Adoption would mean raising the child as her own daughter, while financial support involved more distant, though supportive, involvement, such as funding her upbringing in a welfare home and visiting occasionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin accepted Aurora&#39;s proposal for financial support. Given her status as an unmarried woman,taking in a child wouldn&#39;t be practical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aurora, I recognize your thoughtfulness and the challenges you&#39;ve faced within our family over the years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted by his wife&#39;s ongoing health issues,Franklin could not delve deeper into the conspiracy.His priority was swiftly resolving the situation and providing Jasper with a satisfactory explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you cannot force affection. Jasper isn&#39;t the right match for you, Aurora. Let him go. We&#39;ll assist you in finding someone more compatible,&#34; Franklin said,hoping to steer her toward a happier future.</p>
