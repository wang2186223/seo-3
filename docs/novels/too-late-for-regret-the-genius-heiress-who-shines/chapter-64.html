                <p>Evelina&#39;s immediate reaction was to cover her eyes,simultaneously protecting Minnie and Jasper with her other arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst her agony, which came with a sharp burning sensation, she warned everyone, &#34;Be careful! It&#39;s quicklime!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina!&#34; Jasper sprang into action, his voice filled with concern. &#34;Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the consequences of his actions, the boy who had thrown the lime broke down crying.Simultaneously, Minnie&#39;s cries echoed loudly, adding to the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A caregiver swiftly took Minnie to safety, while Jasper instructed the bodyguards, &#34;Catch that boy don&#39;t let him escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation might have been worse if the boy were Kamryn, seeing the commotion, said, &#34;Please, don&#39;t panic. Return to your classrooms.&#34; She then approached Evelina to assess her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing her eyes were compromised by the lime,Kamryn called out desperately, &#34;Someone bring purified water quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First, bring me some vegetable oil,&#34; Evelina interjected, despite her pain. &#34;I need to use it to get most of the quicklime out of my eyes before rinsing them with purified water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn immediately dashed towards the kitchen.&#34;I&#39;ll get it immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina-&#34; Jasper&#39;s voice betrayed his panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, stay calm!&#34; Evelina urged as she grasped his sleeve, her hand shaking yet her voice steady.&#34;There are cotton swabs in my bag. Please use themn to clear as much lime as you can from my eyes. Also, my phone is there; call Dorothea. I&#39;Il explain so she can get things ready at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Jasper responded, meticulously following Evelina&#39;s directions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While handling the cotton swabs, his hands shook slightly- he knew this task was too delicate to entrust to anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned that the bodyguards might be too harsh,he pondered the consequences of their potential clumsiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper steadied his nerves; knowing Evelina depended solely on him in this moment, he had to ensure his hands were as stable as when he held a firearm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His precise and gentle efforts succeeded in removing much of the lime from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kamryn arrived shortly with the vegetable oil.Following Evelina&#39;s detailed instructions, they dripped a few drops of oil into her eyes and used cotton swabs to remove the quicklime. Then they rinsed her eyes thoroughly with purified water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Jasper whisked her off to the hospital,navigating the streets that were miraculously clear of any traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina would later find out that Jasper had ensured an open route by promising a substantial investment to the local traffic authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon arrival at the hospital, they found Dorothea and the rest of Evelina&#39;s surgical team fully prepared and waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was rushed directly to the operating room upon her arrival at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to the swift first aid and her rapid transport,the quicklime damage was limited to superficial eye tissue, sparing her deeper ocular structures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dorothea emerged shortly after the procedure to update Jasper, who had been anxiously waiting outside. &#34;She&#39;ll need about a week of hospital care,but Evelina&#39;s eyes should heal fully. There&#39;s no need for excessive worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s relief was short-lived as Caleb stormed in and landed a punch on his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you let this happen if you&#39;re always at her side? Weren&#39;t you supposed to protect her?&#34;Caleb&#39;s voice was thick with blame as he seized Jasper by the collar, eyes burning with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Russell family&#39;s bodyguards started to intervene,but Jasper waved them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Matching Caleb&#39;s aggression, Jasper struck back,catching him in the mouth and drawing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Throwing punches is easy, but where were you when Evelina needed protection?&#34; Caleb taunted,wiping the blood from his lip, gearing up for another round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Florrie rushed in, shouting, &#34;Stop this right now! Don&#39;t you dare hit my uncle Jasper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, at just nineteen, displayed remarkable sharpness. &#34;It&#39;s distressing that Evelina was hurt, but right now, we need to focus on her recovery and uncover who orchestrated this attack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and lan had hurried to the hospital immediately after learning of the incident, discussing the details on the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;lan and I gathered some information on the way here,&#34; Florrie continued. &#34;Kamryn interrogated the boy responsible for the lime incident. The boy believed he had purchased a harmless powder for magic tricks, hoping to surprise Evelina with a performance. At only thirteen and known for his good nature, it&#39;s clear he was misled into using harmful materials.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie laid out the sequence of events with concern,saying, &#34;Consider the connections here- from Evelina&#39;s solo trip to the orphanage, to her involvement in the land dispute at the orphanage, to the attack with lime powder. The orchestration behind these events indicates a cold level of calculation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;re fortunate Uncle Jasper was there to mitigate the harm. If not, Evelina&#39;s condition could have been as dire as my own past injuries.&#34;</p>
