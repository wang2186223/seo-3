                <p>Evelina&#39;s shot went awry!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news of Jasper&#39;s engagement cut deeply, and though she shouldn&#39;t have cared, the pain was real and immediate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shook as her emotions swirled, causing the bullet to stray far from its intended mark, hitting only the outer sixth ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand,Idris nailed a perfect ten, his shot steady and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This left Evelina four rings behind after just the first matchup. Given Caleb&#39;s skills, he was no match for Idris&#39;s bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, it&#39;s not over yet. I&#39;ll make up for it-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s voice was hopeful, but his confidence was a facade. He knew his shooting was merely passable.Had Evelina held a four-ring lead,they might have the slightest chance to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, the outlook seemed bleak. Idris, cheerful and boastful, couldn&#39;t resist. &#34;My bodyguard always scores tens. You don&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even perfect scores from Caleb in subsequent rounds wouldn&#39;t be enough to secure a win for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a chuckle, Idris was already looking ahead.&#34;Evelina, I&#39;ve reserved us a table at a top restaurant.Consider it a date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris&#39;s eyes lingered a bit too long on Evelina&#39;s form,his intentions clear in his unpleasant gaze. &#34;&#39;Perhaps after our date, we might extend the evening to a hotel-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smack!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crisp slap cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, stunned and outraged, turned to find Jasper standing there, the source of the slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the sudden violence, Mr. Russell?&#34; Idris protested in a wounded tone, his words laced with aggrieved bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re in debt to me. Isn&#39;t that reason enough?&#34;Jasper&#39;s look was cold, his presence imposing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intimidated by Jasper&#39;s intense gaze, Idris backed down immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Florrie sent me to see how you&#39;re doing,&#34; Jasper said,his voice softening as he looked at Evelina with genuine concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded, her emotions a jumble, &#34;I&#39;m alright,thank you.&#34; She was conflicted, caught off-guard by how close Jasper still felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Jasper was engaged, Evelina wondered if it was appropriate to maintain their closeness. Should she step back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, there&#39;s been an unexpected development-&#34;Caleb approached after finishing a call, his expression troubled and cautious. &#34;I need to head back to lreah right away. A complication arose in one of my cases,and I have to handle it personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re leaving just like that? What about our match?&#34;the bodyguard beside Idris asked irritably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still fuming from earlier, when he&#39;d witnessed his boss being humiliated but was forbidden from retaliating,the bodyguard saw Caleb&#39;s sudden departure as yet another source of frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Caleb now stepping away without even competing, the bodyguard&#39;s frustration had nowhere to go. &#34;You should handle your business,&#34; Evelina replied calmly, showing no resentment, only understanding for Caleb&#39;s difficult position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Caleb&#39;s recent promotion at his law firm,unresolved issues could severely impact his professional standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly intervened, signaling to one of his own security team members, &#34;Take Caleb to the airport immediately. I won&#39;t have Evelina worrying about your safety.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper&#39;s right,&#34; Evelina replied, comforted by the presence of a reliable Russell family guard accompanying Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; Caleb responded reluctantly,burdened by guilt at leaving Evelina during such a crucial moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Caleb&#39;s departure, Evelina stood firm in her resolve to continue the competition alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris immediately objected, irritation clear in his voice.&#34;We agreed each competitor could bring one partner.How could you possibly compete twice yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dismissed her efforts with a careless wave. &#34;Just give up now.Considering your current state, is there really any point in pushing forward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His harsh words struck Evelina deeply, stirring a painful ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had made a promise to herself afterdeparting from the Gibson family; she would no longer pity any man, choosing instead to live solely for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Jasper&#39;s engagement stirred her emotions unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can take her place in the competition,&#34; Jasper said with ease, shrugging out of his jacket and neatly rolling up his sleeves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting the not-quite-healed scar from a knife wound on his arm, Evelina intervened, &#34;Jasper, you shouldn&#39;t. Your arm still hasn&#39;t fully recovered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s alright,it&#39;s pretty much healed.&#34; Jasper reassured her, flexing his arm to demonstrate its mobility. He then gave her a reassuring smile. &#34;You&#39;re not worried I might make a fool of myself, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina responded with a slight shake of her head, &#34;Of course not,Jasper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was hesitant to become indebted to Jasper,concerned about the complexities of their ties and wondering how she might later disentangle herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, on edge, questioned Jasper&#39;s sudden decision to participate, asking, &#34;Mr. Russell, joining at this stage..doesn&#39;t seem proper,does it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, with his military background, wasn&#39;t just any shooter; he was skilled enough to demand more challenging targets, which would put ldris&#39;s bodyguard at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it you who said each contestant could pick their most trusted to shoot? Well, I am her choice now,&#34;Jasper replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking down at Idris, Jasper mimicked the tone Idris had earlier used to intimidate Evelina. &#34;What&#39;s the matter? Are you scared now? If so, you might as well concede defeat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris swallowed hard, thrown off by Jasper&#39;s challenge.&#34;Mr. Russell, with a fiancee already, and still showing such closeness to Evelina... aren&#39;t you concerned about upsetting Aurora Marsh from the Marsh family?&#34;</p>
