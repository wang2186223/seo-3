                <p>A smile broke across Jasper&#39;s face as he looked at Evelina. Her lively demeanor charmed him increasingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They walked off the plane separately and did not hold hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Cary let out a sigh of relief, and he kept inching towards Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The path was blocked by lanand the Russell bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Marsh is under our protectionlan said, his voice cold. &#34;I would advise you not to interfere, Mr.Gibson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>still my wife,&#34; Cary retorted, frustration evident in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan gave him a cold stare. &#34;That&#39;s about to change. I&#39;d recommend you keep your distance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jasper openly expressing his interest in Evelina, the Russell family&#39;s intent was clear-they wouldn&#39;t allow the Gibson family to procrastinate over the divorce any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon exiting the plane, Jasper and Evelina didn&#39;t head for the terminal. Instead, they awaited a helicopter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night descended and the news came; adverse weather had delayed the helicopter. Hailstorms across the route made flying dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;It seems you were right-someone does want to keep us here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina,responded calmly, &#34;Now, I&#39;m intrigued to discover who might be behind this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s eyes sparkled with determination. &#34;I&#39;m eager to see who dares challenge us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knowing glance passed between them, accompanied by a conspiratorial smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As darkness enveloped Eastmere and their options dwindled, finding overnight accommodations became inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Due to a bustling local festival, every nearby hotel was at full capacity. lan worked his connections to secure the last two available rooms at a secluded four-star hotel on the outskirts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was the best available,&#34; lan explained, somewhat apologetically. &#34;You&#39;ll have to make it work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Jasper and Evelina took the news in stride, expressing no displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arrival at the hotel, they discovered Cary already there, mingling with some other unassuming wealthy youth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After being ousted from the airport by lan, Cary&#39;s unexpected reunion with Evelina sparked a vindictive pleasure in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mused internally that fate seemed intent on delivering Evelina back into his sphere. Regardless of her new ties with Jasper, she couldn&#39;t seem to shake him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting them, Cary couldn&#39;t resist mocking, &#34;Look who it is. I didn&#39;t expect to bump into you here. What&#39;s the matter, didn&#39;t make it to lreah?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s response was a dismissive look, treating Cary like an insignificant annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their arrival pushed the hotel to its limit, forcing Jasper and Evelina to share the presidential suite due to lack of other accommodations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Jasper had intended to offer Evelina the entire suite and find alternative accommodations for himself, but every room was booked-lan and the bodyguards even had to cram into a double.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My apologies for the tight quarters,&#34; Jasper said to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not a problem,&#34; she responded with a smile, looking around the spacious suite. &#34;There are plenty of rooms here.We&#39;ll manage just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take the master bedroom,&#34; Jasper insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; Evelina replied, appreciating his considerate offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Cary erupted with resentment. &#34;Evelina! You&#39;re still legally my wife, and here you are, planning to room with another man? How do you see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Evelina coolly replied, &#34;As a joke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged yet impotent, Cary&#39;s complexion reddened, yet he restrained himself from confronting Jasper directly. The surrounding onlookers laughed openly at his plight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have no shame-&#34; Cary tried to retort, his anger peaking, but stopped short as one of Jasper&#39;s bodyguards made a subtle threatening gesture. He quickly retreated amidst the crowd&#39;s mocking cries of &#34;Coward!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jasper and Evelina prepared to retire to their suite, their path was unexpectedly crossed by another arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice was unmistakable. &#34;Jasper? Is that really you? What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora paused in the doorway, her small suitcase in tow, appearing as if she had traveled far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bodyguard followed, laden with an excessive amount of luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, with a hint of suspicion, replied, &#34;I was about to ask you the same. What brings you to Eastmere?Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s a coincidence.&#34;</p>
