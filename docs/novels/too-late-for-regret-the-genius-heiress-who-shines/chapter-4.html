                <p>Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, &#34;Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare walk away from me!&#34; Cary&#39;s temper flared,readying himself to berate her once more-but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist-details he&#39;d somehow overlooked until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise,and elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn&#39;t even touched her once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Cary&#39;s intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary&#39;s sleeve. &#34;What are you doing, Cary? You&#39;ve upset Esme, and now she&#39;s leaving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary blinked,momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. &#34;Evi, my dear girl, you&#39;ve endured so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t worry yourself, Demi.&#34; Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again,kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. &#34;The weather is getting chilly-are your joints troubling you again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi sighed deeply. &#34;Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve treated me like family all these years, Demi.  This is the very least I can do in return,&#34; Evelina replied sincerely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her honest kindness only deepened Demi&#39;s regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That foolish grandson of mine-blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,&#34; Demi replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. &#34;It&#39;s alright,Demi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenderly, Demi pleaded, &#34;Evi, sweetheart... just once more,can you give Cary another chance-for my sake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn&#39;t change anything,&#34;Evelina answered quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone.&#34;Perhaps it&#39;s just fate... our family wasn&#39;t fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glistened with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary&#39;s mother,Elora Gibson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi&#39;s temper erupted immediately. She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme&#39;s feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme&#39;s luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp cry escaped Esme&#39;s lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated,every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques-her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair,notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that about, Grandma?&#34; Cary exclaimed,swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more,flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Demi,however, remained fiercely unapologetic. &#34;How dare you even ask? Without this woman&#39;s antics,would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary&#39;s bright future. Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride Esme hadn&#39;t just harmed her grandson, she&#39;d damaged the entire Gibson legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve said this countless times,&#34; Cary responded in exasperation. &#34;Esme wasn&#39;t responsible for that accident. Why can&#39;t you trust me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina,who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be Evelina causing trouble again-poisoning Demi&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without restraint, he said sharply, &#34;Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina&#39;s modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, &#34;Of course it&#39;s her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family.She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she&#39;s utterly despicable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself,Demi interrupted harshly, &#34;Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?&#34; Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, &#34;Demi, I didn&#39;t mean-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, &#34;Grandma, please stop scolding Mom Let&#39;s just face reality-you simply don&#39;t want me to leave Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning deliberately, he took Esme&#39;s hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. &#34;But that&#39;s non -negotiable. Esme is the one I love-she is my only future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,&#34; Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm.Anger visibly surged through her,shaking her frail body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, &#34;Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I&#39;m alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s eyes widened in alarm. &#34;Grandma, you can&#39;t mean-&#34; With fierce authority, Demi&#39;s frail hand slammed against her chair&#39;s armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. &#34;I&#39;ve spoken, and my decision is final,&#34; she replied resolutely. &#34;Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.&#34;</p>
