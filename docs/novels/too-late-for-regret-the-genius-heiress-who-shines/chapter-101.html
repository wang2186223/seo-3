                <p>The entrances to the men&#39;s and women&#39;s pools were separate, yet the pools themselves were merely divided by a fence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the men and women were out of each other&#39;s sight, their voices carried over clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Evelina and her friends entered the women&#39;s section, Jasper&#39;s orders of fruit juices, wines, and snacks began to be served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had barely touched her food on the flight from Eastmere to lreah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon their arrival, Jasper, worried she might be hungry, had thoughtfully arranged a selection of her preferred snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These treats were freshly prepared, emphasizing healthiness and taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything I love is here!&#34; Florrie exclaimed, her eyes lighting up in excitement at the sight of the treats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cake in each hand, she munched away gleefully. &#34;Uncle Jasper used to say it was too much hassle before, claiming the chef was always too busy. But now that Evelina is here, suddenly the chef finds the time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a light-hearted tone, she teased Evelina, &#34;It&#39;s clear my uncle prefers his sweetheart over his niece!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind the bamboo fence, Jasper&#39;s laughter resonated. &#34;Even surrounded by all these treats, you&#39;re still complaining?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous grin, Florrie stuck out her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina gently cleaned the crumbs from Florrie&#39;s face, smiling warmly.&#34;Don&#39;t rush. I promise, whenever l have something good to eat, you&#39;ll always have your share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s grin widened. &#34;You&#39;re the best, Evelina,&#34; She then called out over the fence, &#34;Uncle Jasper, take note! Happy wife, happy life. You should try to keep pace with Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite not having responded to Jasper&#39;s advances, Evelina found herself blushing at the sudden reference to them as a couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an attempt to quiet Florrie, Evelina quickly pushed a piece of cake into her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the comment to heart, Jasper responded earnestly, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina&#39;s cheeks grew even hotter, she wished she could hide underwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Florrie and Kristina giggled at Evelina&#39;s visible discomfort, enjoying the rare sight of her flustered state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora entered at that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A world away from the timid girl in the changing room, she slipped off her robe by the pool with quiet confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly,her figure was impressive-fit, yet curvy in all the right places.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen enough?&#34; Aurora asked with a scornful look, catching Kristina&#39;s gaze as she stepped into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina had a good figure too, though her chest was on the flatter side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stung by Aurora&#39;s derisive look, Kristina retorted sharply, &#34;Why would I waste my time looking at you?Evelina&#39;s the one with the stunning figure, looking just as good in or out of clothes, every curve smooth and flawless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then called out louder for all to hear, &#34;Mr, Russell, you&#39;ve truly captured a gem in Evelina.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her usual confidence in her figure, Aurora was taken aback by Kristina&#39;s harsh words, her expression contorting in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the adjacent men&#39;s pool, a low chuckle was heard. &#34;Evelina&#39;s beauty and physique are merely the tip of the iceberg of her qualities.&#34; &#34;Exactly,&#34; Florrie chimed in enthusiastically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to lighten the mood, she puffed up her still-maturing chest and joked, &#34;Kristina, do you think I could look like Evelina if I work at it for a few years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina responded with genuine laughter, &#34;Keep eating well, and you might stand a chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter filled the air once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Aurora sat apart from the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina and Evelina exchanged meaningful looks, having discreetly checked Aurora&#39;s skin for any signs of tattoos but finding none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, they pondered their next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should they attempt to remove her remaining clothes, her bandeau and shorts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what if they still found nothing?</p>
