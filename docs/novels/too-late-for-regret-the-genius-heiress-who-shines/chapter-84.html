                <p>Cary collapsed into his seat, visibly defeated and silenced, his face a mask of humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet internally, he boiled with fury. Evelina had betrayed him, and he was determined not to let her escape consequence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Evelina, Cary&#39;s feelings were a distant concern. Even as Jasper declared her his, she only briefly registered surprise before focusing on the crisis at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon receiving the purser&#39;s update on the co-pilot&#39;s injury, Evelina&#39;s expression turned grave. She immediately requested lan to fetch a windproof jacket for Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purser, who had planned to send Evelina into the cockpit because the co-pilot was confined to his post,was taken aback by her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper took a moment to explain the severity of the situation to the purser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purser wasted no time in contacting the captain through the intercom. Following a quick discussion, it was decided that once the cockpit door opened, Jasper would step in to assume co-pilot duties, allowing the injured co-pilot to exit for medical care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This plan was deemed the most practicaI given the current emergency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless, a passenger, misunderstanding the plan, asked Jasper,&#34;Why are you to assume the co-pilot&#39;s role? Are you even qualified to fly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper ignored the baseless skepticism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he enter the cockpit if he lacked the necessary skills?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The urgency in the cockpit was clear, indicating.that the situation might be graver than it appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing Jasper face undue criticism, Evelina couldn&#39;t hold back. She defended him vehemently to the questioning passenger, saying,&#34;a former Air Force pilot and flew fighter jets. We&#39;re about to navigate through a storm, and cooperation is crucial. If you can&#39;t contribute positively, at least remain quiet and stop stirring panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; the man said, about to hurl an insult. But suddenly, lan&#39;s hand came down hard on his head,effectively cutting him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man was known to lan; he was the spoiled son of a prominent businessman from Ireah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he realized it was lan who had struck him, he chose to remain silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning with the jacket Evelina had asked for, lan addressed Jasper. &#34;Mr. Russell.&#34; Evelina then took the jacket from lan and helped Jasper into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina fitted the jacket on him, Jasper was momentarily swept up by the thought of their possible future together-Evelina as his wife, her warmth, her care for his well-being, and her readiness to defend him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Jasper had never previously considered marriage appealing, the idea of marrying Evelina seemed not just tolerable, but desirable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, best of luck. We&#39;re all behind you,&#34; Evelina said, concealing the dread and reluctance that weighed on her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Evelina had thought of Jasper as merely a brief</p>
