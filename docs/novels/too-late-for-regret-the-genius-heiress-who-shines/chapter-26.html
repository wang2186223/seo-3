                <p>Esme didn&#39;t immediately seek out Cary after making her dramatic exit. Instead, she retreated to a restroom on the building&#39;s first floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she hadn&#39;t shed any actual tears. Now, she was carefully applying water to her cheeks to mimic tear tracks and irritating her eyes to achieve the right shade of red, crafting a believable look of distress.Once satisfied with her appearance, she entered the Gold Suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary was already there, greeting her warmly. &#34;Esme,you&#39;re here! We&#39;ve been keeping the food warm for you,&#34; he said as she walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Esme had visited the Morningstar villa to conduct a supposed evaluation of Florrie&#39;s eyesight.Cary had quickly spread the word, which had the Aglonard elite humming with the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme was now seen as a key ally to the Russell family&#39;s young heiress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had led to an influx of favors and offers from the city&#39;s elite, all eager to earn Esme&#39;s favor. One of them even proposed leveraging political connections to secure the release of her prospective sister-in-law from incarceration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,clearly enchanted by Esme&#39;s newfound influence,couldn&#39;t hide his admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have waited,&#34; Esme said gracefully,settling into her seat beside him. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t want to be a bother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quick to please, a guest noticed her reddened eyes.&#34;Miss Barton, are you alright? Your eyes... you seem upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme brushed off the concern with a shaky voice. &#34;Oh no,it&#39;s nothing at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,concerned, took her hand and looked at her intently. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Esme? Did someone upset you today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, portraying reluctance. &#34;It&#39;s really nothing... Not worth mentioning at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a waiter entered with a fresh plate.The sight of Esme made her exclaim,&#34;Oh my,you&#39;re the woman who was mistreated in the lobby earlier,aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme quickly bowed her head and covered her face with her hands. &#34;You must be confusing me with someone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,however,pressed for details. He fixed the waiter with an intense gaze. &#34;Explain what you saw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter, who had discreetly received a tip from Esme earlier, began a detailed account. She painted a picture where Evelina was the aggressor, publicly shaming a defenseless Esme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s hand hit the table hard. &#34;Her again? Isn&#39;t it enough that she&#39;s destroyed my sister&#39;s reputation?Now Esme too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme remained silent, dabbing at her eyes delicately,her lack of response speaking volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s anger surged at the sight of her apparent vulnerability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to find her, now. Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, her voice barely above a whisper, responded,&#34;Forget it, Cary. She&#39;s beyond us now, enjoying in the Platinum Suite with some companion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, gentle yet fraught with insinuation, left a lasting impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The murmurs around the table grew. One guest whispered, &#34;Probably some old rich guy, going bald.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s lips curved into a smug grin as the rumors multiplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the Platinum Suite-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb was enthusiastically tackling a heap of the restaurant&#39;s spiciest offerings. &#34;These are the specialties of the house,&#34; he said, glaring playfully at Jasper while stuffing his face. &#34;Evi actually helped craft some of these recipes with the chef. You&#39;ve got to try them, Jasper. It would be a shame to ignore Evi&#39;s hard work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spicy food was Jasper&#39;s rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than a mere dislike, it was an allergy-chilies could set his entire body aflame with discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb&#39;s encouragement and Evelina&#39;s presence pushed Jasper, his jaw tightening as he reluctantly tried the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s patience snapped as she looked at Caleb critically. &#34;Caleb, really? Light dishes, remember?Jasper is dealing with an arm injury, and my back isn&#39;t great either. We shouldn&#39;t be eating spicy food.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of her injury, Caleb&#39;s playful tone vanished. &#34;Your back is hurt? Show me where.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay seated!&#34; Evelina firmly pushed him down.&#34;Please remove these and bring us some less spicy dishes.&#34; Turning to Jasper, she quickly fetched a glass of water. &#34;Here, drink this. It might ease the burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their fingers touched briefly over the glass, a subtle electric sensation sparked between them. Evelina quickly withdrew her hand as if burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, clearly shaken, rapidly downed his water and began to cough violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Caleb was on the verge of making a cutting remark but hesitated when Evelina extended her hand to comfort Jasper, gently patting his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take it easy,&#34; she murmured soothingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Witnessing this tenderness, a wave of jealousy washed over Caleb. He suddenly started to cough excessively himself. &#34;Evi! Something&#39;s wrong... check on me too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina shot him a skeptical look. &#34;Caleb, you know I&#39;m a doctor, right? Pretending doesn&#39;t work with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Cary stormed into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his wake, Jasper&#39;s guards hurried in after him.&#34;We&#39;re sorry, sir. He got past us-&#34;</p>
