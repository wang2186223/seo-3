                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you request the master bedroom for yourself, Aurora?&#34; Evelina asked smoothly.&#34;That leaves only the spare room for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The setup in a modest four-star hotel like this one typically included a presidential suite with just two bedrooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can&#39;t be right,&#34; Aurora replied, pacing the suite. Yet, it was true-there were only two bedrooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to see Evelina and Jasper share a room, she managed a forced smile and suggested, &#34;There&#39;s also a meeting room, a study, and even a staff room. You&#39;re strong, Evelina-surely you can manage one night in less comfort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was patronizing, as though she was extending a kindness to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s laughter was brief and mocking. &#34;Perhaps you should take one of those rooms? Or is it that you&#39;re too delicate, and I should endure because I&#39;m just the tough one who can handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, accustomed to praise and comfort, found herself at a loss for words in the face of such frankness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean that-&#34; Aurora responded, flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina interrupted her sharply, &#34;Remember, Jasper was reluctant to even let you stay. I was the one who persuaded him to show you some hospitality.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina pushed Aurora aside gently and strode confidently into the master bedroom, hauling her suitcase.&#34;You&#39;re just a guest here, and you dare to demand privileges? You can share this room with me or try to fit into the other one with Jasper. Or, take your pick from those other spaces you suggested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a definitive bang, Evelina&#39;s words were punctuated by Jasper shutting the door of the other bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora was out of options. It was either share the room with Evelina or spend the night on the floor. With a clenched jaw, she slammed the door shut behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Internally, Aurora seethed with anger. She thought, &#34;You&#39;ll regret this. You won&#39;t even see the dawn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhausted from the day&#39;s events, Evelina didn&#39;t hesitate to prepare for bed, grabbing her pajamas and heading for the shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, Aurora-I snore, grind my teeth, hog the blankets, and might even chat in my sleep.Hope that&#39;s not a problem,&#34; Evelina called out nonchalantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After her shower and a quick hair dry, she donned her sleep mask and earplugs, and wasted no time in getting into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Aurora was left stewing in front of the vanity, her makeup not yet fully removed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, she had attempted to snoop through Evelina&#39;s suitcase while she showered, only to find it securely locked with a password. To her shock, a failed attempt at guessing the combination resulted in a mild electric zap, causing her to drop the suitcase in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,seeing Evelina asleep, she reached for Evelina&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recently, she had noticed that Jasper seemed particularly fond of Evelina, and she desperately needed to gauge the depth of their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as she reached for thephone resting on the nightstand, a loud alarm erupted fromn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Evelina sat up swiftly, removing her sleep mask and fixing Aurora with an intense stare. &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, caught off-guard, stammered, &#34;I was just reaching for a tissue, and your phone... it was an accident.&#34; She quickly grabbed a handful of tissues and retreated to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An accident? There were tissue boxes all over the room, yet Aurora chose to reach for the one next to Evelina&#39;s phone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina chose not to confront Aurora directly. Instead, she tucked her phone under her pillow and settled back into bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she had to stay alert; Aurora was likely up to something. Inside the bathroom, Aurora seethed, her anger barely contained. She wished she could lash out at Evelina this very moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and hastily sent a message to a hidden contact, saying, &#34;Change of plans. Make it an hour earlier. I want Jasper to be mine, and for Evelina to be out of the picture for good.&#34;</p>
