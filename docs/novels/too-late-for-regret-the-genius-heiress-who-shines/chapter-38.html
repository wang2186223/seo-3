                <p>The city&#39;s premier shooting club in Aglonard buzzed with anticipation for the upcoming competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawn by Idris&#39;s fame, enthusiasts and admirers alike filled the venue, eager to witness the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Accompanied by Jasper, Florrie excitedly attended to support Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially hesitant, Jasper had worried Florrie might grow bored-or worse, encounter trouble just before her critical surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Evelina convinced him gently, suggesting,&#34;Florrie&#39;s trying to hide her fears about the surgery behind her optimism. A change of scenery could really help ease her nerves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly agreed,reinforcing security measures in line with Evelina&#39;s thoughtful advice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie,delighted,affectionately kissed Evelina on the cheek. &#34;You&#39;re amazing, Evelina! Uncle Jasper,always follow her suggestions from now on!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina effortlessly offered solutions for others, yet  when confronting her own troubles, she tended to handle them quietly, alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Evelina.&#34; Caleb reassured confidently. &#34;I&#39;ve trained diligently with a nationaI shooting champion -my aim won&#39;t let you down. Just focus as usual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rules, set by Idris, required each participant and their partner to shoot three rounds, with the combined total determining the winner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Idris had confidently chosen his bodyguard as his partner, while Evelina had picked Caleb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after the teams had been finalized did Evelina discover ldris&#39;s partner was a former national shooting champion!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately,changing partners was impossible-ldris had clearly specified any substitutions would invalidate the match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb had minimal real-world shooting experience,so they had delayed the competition for three long years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll give it our all,&#34; Evelina said firmly. She&#39;d once been a renowned sharpshooter herself, the primary reason Idris eagerly accepted her challenge</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,objectively speaking, their combined expertise fell short compared to ldris and his highly skilled bodyguard. &#34;Your best won&#39;t cut it, my dear Evelina,&#34; Idris teased,his eyes lingering on her appreciatively. &#34;You&#39;ve grown even more captivating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching confidently, Idris&#39;s bald head glistened,his broad smile stretching from ear to ear. &#34;Don&#39;t forget our little bet-if you lose, you&#39;ll be my girlfriend for an entire month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb bristled angrily. &#34;You tricked us! We agreed to bring trusted associates, and yet your partner is a champion shooter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris chuckled slyly, clearly amused. &#34;My bodyguard is indeed my most reliable person-nothing unfair there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina said coolly, her tone sharp, &#34;Idris, the deal was you&#39;d have one month to try winning me over if I lost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pursuing her was vastly different from an actual commitment. Evelina intended to ensure that distinction remained clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, despite the disadvantage, she wasn&#39;t ready to concede defeat before the competition had even begun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, his gaze greedy, scratched his chin with a smirk.&#34;Isn&#39;t it practically the same thing? I&#39;m determined you&#39;ll be mine,Evelina.&#34; The thought of a beautiful young woman skilled in marksmanship thrilled him deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb couldn&#39;t contain his disdain. &#34;Unbelievable! At nearly fifty, you&#39;re still eyeing Evelina?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris, confidently rubbing his belly, retorted, &#34;Perhaps Evelina prefers someone skilled. We older men understand the finer points of cherishing a woman...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Jasper&#39;s cold voice interjected through the air from behind Idris, &#34;It appears you have some pending loans with the Russell Group Bank. Care to explain when these will be cleared?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of Jasper&#39;s words made Idris tremble with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris spun around to find Jasper stepping closer,and he hastily straightened up, his tone respectful. &#34;Mr.Russell, to what do I owe this unexpected visit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s demeanor was cold as he replied, &#34;I&#39;m here about y/our debts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bead of sweat trickled down Idris&#39;s forehead as he replied, &#34;Such a trivial sum... Surely it&#39;s not worth your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring his comment, Jasper moved to Evelina&#39;s side and said reassuringly, &#34;This is merely a small challenge, and I&#39;ve placed my bets on your victory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idris flinched, interpreting Jasper&#39;s statement as a veiled threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The implication was clear: losing to Evelina wasn&#39;t just an option; it was a mandate from Jasper himself.Failure to comply could have terrible consequences.</p>
