                <p>Chapter in he life, yet now, the thought of his potential loss filled her with deep sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper responded with a determined nod, &#34;Evelina, please wait for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right as everyone braced themselves, the cockpit door swung open unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp, cold wind blasted from the cockpit into the cabin, causing uncontrollable shivering among the passengers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially skepticaI of Evelina&#39;s request for a jacket, lan now realized its importance and admired her foresight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wind was fierce enough that unsecured passengers could have easily been swept off their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the help of nearby passengers pushing him forward against the powerful gusts, Jasper managed to make his way into the cockpit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, he found the conditions more severe than he had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cockpit&#39;s right-side window was damaged, featuring a hole with spreading cracks that threatened its entire integrity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite wearing oxygen masks, the captain and co-pilot struggled with the biting cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly equipped himself with an oxygen mask and took the injured co-pilot&#39;s place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wounded co-pilot, cradling his arm, swiftly exited the cockpit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the door shut, the cabin atmosphere felt instantly revitalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flight attendants and the purser escorted the injured co-pilot to Jasper&#39;s previous seat, where Evelina was ready to administer medical care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She skillfully addressed a deep cut on his right arm, cleaning and stitching the wound, applying necessary medication, and finally bandaging it securely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief was evident on the co-pilot&#39;s face after Evelina&#39;s treatment. He expressed his gratitude and his eagerness to return to the cockpit to assist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your arm needs more recovery time. You wouldn&#39;t beof much help in your current state,&#34; Evelina cautioned him sternly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just worried... they haven&#39;t worked as a team before,&#34; the co-pilot replied, visibly anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Rest assured, his experience with collaborative efforts is extensive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s faith in Jasper was unwavering, though she couldn&#39;t exactly explain why she felt so certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should concentrate on staying safe here, to ensure we&#39;re not a distraction,&#34; she suggested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she finished her statement, the cabin lights began to flicker forebodingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aircraft was nearing the storm&#39;s most intense area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was familiar with this scenario; she knew the lighting and communications systems were likely to fail imminently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the purser&#39;s eye, she nodded subtly, and the purser promptly instructed all passengers to secure themselves by sitting and buckling up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, darkness swallowed the cabin.</p>
