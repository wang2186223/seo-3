                <p>Cary burst into the room, his eyes seething with anger.He found Evelina casually enjoying the company of two notably attractive men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next to her was the same handsome man from the Dusk Lounge event, who had previously received ten roses from Evelina under Cary&#39;s watchful eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attempts to intervene had clearly failed, as evidenced by their current friendship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, really?&#34; Cary seethed. &#34;We&#39;re still married,and here you are, charming other men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper,still recovering from his coughing fit,scowled,preparing to have his security remove Cary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb,however,addressed him first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look who it is. The cheating husband and his mistress,&#34;Caleb said with biting sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering over Cary at six feet one inch, Caleb peered disdainfully at him and Esme who had followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Cary asked &#34;I&#39;m a lawyer,&#34; Caleb replied with cold precision. &#34;I deal with shameless people daily, but you, sir,are exceptional. Cheating on your wife, flaunting your affair before your divorce is finalized, and having the audacity to accuse her in public?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up!&#34; Cary shouted, losing his comnposure and throwing a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb easily dodged, making Cary&#39;s attempt look foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary wasn&#39;t actually aiming to hit Caleb; it was a diversion to reach. Evelina. He jabbed a finger accusingly at her, his voice dripping with contempt.&#34;You claimed you were sick, confined to bed rest.What is this charade? Cozying up with your new lover?You deceitful slut!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he referring to Jasper as her boy toy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards of the Russell family tensed instantly.History had it that the last individual who dared yell at Jasper Russell vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling calm settled over Jasper&#39;s features, his anger nearing its peak. Before he could erupt, Evelina stepped closer, touching his shoulder subtly, her gesture surprisingly tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For anyone else, such familiarity would have warranted  immediate ejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,for Evelina, Jasper remained unbothered, almost appreciative of her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina met Cary&#39;s fury with cold disdain. &#34;The manI&#39;m with now surpasses you in every conceivable way-more attractive, wealthier, and vastly/ superior in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck Cary like physical blows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary lost it. &#34;That&#39;s a lie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme, catching every word, teared up. &#34;Cary... have you really been with her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s denial was swift and desperate. &#34;No! I swear,I haven&#39;t laid a finger on her since our marriage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s smirk deepened. &#34;Caught onto my deception,have you? So what grounds do you have for your accusations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slapped his pointing hand aside with force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the slap filled the room, and Cary shouted, nursing his hand in agony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good heavens, Cary!&#34; Esme hurried to his side,her concern veiled with an opportunity to criticize Evelina.&#34;That&#39;s uncalled for! Hitting someone like that -I&#39;m calling the cops!&#34; Evelina looked at her coolly. &#34;Sure, go ahead. That should help them investigate who got Margot to hire those kidnappers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme stopped, her phone halfway to her ear. &#34;What..Are you suggesting I was involved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had entertained the thought. Margot had the malice but not the brains for such a plot-unless she was coached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle change in Esme&#39;s expression was telling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Strange, isn&#39;t it? Three years my marriage went smoothly. Then you come along, and suddenly I&#39;m facing thugs? Quite the coincidence.&#34; Evelina&#39;s tone was frosty, slicing through the mounting tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget-I challenged you openly. I dared you to heal Florrie&#39;s eyesight or admit to being a sham. You had a motive to get rid of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary&#39;s expression contorted with uncertainty, as he hadn&#39;t thought of this angle before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled the secretive conversation Esme had with Margot that evening. Could it be that she had manipulated her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme erupted, unable to hide her panic. &#34;She&#39;s fabricating everything!Evelina,where&#39;s your evidence?&#34; Evelina responded calmly, &#34;Direct proof? I lack it.However, Margot knows who planted the scheme in her head. If she confesses, I&#39;ll retract my accusation.She could go free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Cary faced a dilemma. Should he support his sister or stand by his girlfriend? Evelina&#39;s statement had forced him to choose.</p>
