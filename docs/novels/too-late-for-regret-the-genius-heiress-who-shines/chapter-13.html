                <p>&#34;Are we going to die?&#34; the blind girl asked, her voice strained with fear. &#34;I&#39;m terrified... I just want to be back home...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t cry. We&#39;ll make it through this.Remember, you mentioned your father and uncle are influential. They&#39;re bound to rescue us,&#34; the other girl said,her own eyes betraying her terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, meanwhile, tilted her ear toward the door,gauging the noise outside. The thugs were still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all she needed to know. With a deft movement, she loosened her bindings and freed her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had slyly ensured the ropes were loosely tied when the thugs restrained her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart,your blindness came later in life, didn&#39;t it?&#34;Evelina knelt before the blind girl, gently untying her wrists. &#34;Let&#39;s dry those tears now. Crying can strain your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbeknownst to the others, the blind girl was Florrie Russell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by the unknown voice,Florrie initially recoiled.Yet there was something reassuring about Evelina&#39;s tone,which eased her fear quickly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Florrie murmured. &#34;How did you know I wasn&#39;t born blind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other girl gazed at Evelina, her eyes wide with astonishment. &#34;Have they taken you captive too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed.&#34; Evelina swiftly reassured, gently stroking Florrie&#39;s hair. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll lead us to freedom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it true?&#34; Florrie&#39;s voice rose with a spark of hope.&#34;Could my uncle have sent you to rescue us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep it down,&#34; Evelina quickly cautioned, placing her hand gently over Florrie&#39;s mouth to silence her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the need for quiet, Florie nodded, her lips shaking slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the second girl, Evelina swiftly untied her.&#34;Are you hurt? Can you manage to run?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears were wiped away as both girls nodded in affirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina assessed their surroundings quickly. The windows, too high and narrow, offered no viable escape; the only exit was the door, guarded by three thugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would need a clever plan, not force,to escape</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered the girls close, sharing her plan in a hushed tone. &#34;Everyone understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; they replied softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Great. Now, let&#39;s make our move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shortly after, all three girls were ready in their assigned spots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the floor, Florrie mimicked a seizure, convulsing and frothing effectively. Simultaneously, her companion unleashed a barrage of screams,hammering on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help! We need help! She&#39;s got foam at her mouth!l think she&#39;s dying! Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion disturbed the three thugs outside,who were laughing over their game of dice and drinks.One of them abruptly put his glass down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet down in there!&#34; he yelled, delivering a forceful kick to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paralyzed by fear, the girl who was screaming momentarily lost her script. Without missing a beat, Evelina pleaded, &#34;Please, sir!Consider this-if she expires here, what will you say to Mr.Reid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Provoked by her words, the thug, swearing under his breath, unlocked the door and stormed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Evelina landed a precise elbow to his neck, knocking him out instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move!&#34; Evelna commanded sharply, pulling the blind girl swiftly to her feet. &#34;Grab my hand and hold tight -do exactly as I say!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aware of Florrie&#39;s vulnerability, Evelina positioned herself protectively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed a broken chair leg into the second girl&#39;s hands. &#34;Stay behind me, and keep close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding Florrie&#39;s hand securely and ensuring the second girl followed closely, Evelina surged toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think you&#39;re running off to?&#34; Two more thugs rushed in from the side,brandishing metal pipes menacingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden threat immobilized the girls momentarily,  their knees shaking from fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Run!&#34; Evelina fiercely pushed the second girl onward.&#34;Don&#39;t look back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting another broken stool leg nearby, she quickly kicked it upward with perfect aim, striking one attacker squarely in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Argh!&#34; The man collapsed instantly, unconscious before he hit the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged, the last thug swung his pipe viciously toward Evelina and Florrie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though unable to see, Florrie sharply heard the rush of the weapon and instinctively gasped in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror froze her muscles, leaving her helplessly immobilized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina grabbed the back of her head and pushed her down with a steady hand. &#34;Stay low!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie ducked at the last second, and the pipe sliced through the air right above her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite repeatedly dodging attacks, Evelina struggled to find an opening to counter, her energy quickly draining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety gripped her,tightening her breath. Surprisingly, Florrie&#39;s fear transformed into a sudden burst of bravado, and she giggled mockingly. &#34;You can&#39;t even hit us, can you? You&#39;re hopeless!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Furious, the thug&#39;s face contorted with rage.&#34;Bitch-you&#39;ve asked for it!&#34; With a fierce yell, he raised the pipe high, bringing it down savagely toward Florrie&#39;s head.</p>
