                <p>After a brief pause, Franklin&#39;s voice returned, initially caught off guard by Evelina&#39;s determined tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed, you have every right to seek justice,&#34; he quickly replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was considering commending Franklin for his apparent reasonableness compared to Ady and Aurora, but he interjected with a hesitant &#34;However  1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s expression tightened. &#34;What exactly do you mean by &#39;however&#39;?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;During his investigation, Jasper encountered complications. Sadly, Aurora&#39;s assistant passed away in the hospital,&#34; Franklin explained with caution,hinting that Jasper&#39;s aggressive approach to uncovering the truth had led to tragic consequences. This implication meant that pursuing legal action might expose Jasper to liability, given the death involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Marsh, are you implying that my uncle Jasper caused her death? He is a person with strong principles; he wouId never do something like that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie had been quietly keeping to herself, not planning to say a word. But the moment the Marsh family started blaming Jasper, she couldn&#39;t stay silent-her face turned red with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin was taken aback to hear Florrie&#39;s voice on the call; he hadn&#39;t anticipated her presence. He quickly tried to clarify his position. &#34;Florrie, please don&#39;t misunderstand my intentions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, visibly irritated, dismissed his explanation with a sharp huff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, noticing Florrie&#39;s agitation, clasped her hand as a sign of solidarity and to calm her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then addressed Franklin, asking, &#34;Mr. Marsh,  what do you suggest we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he picked up on Evelina&#39;s underlying tone of skepticism, Franklin knew he had to tread carefully to preserve his family&#39;s image and safety. He earnestly suggested, &#34;Ms. Marsh, If you prefer to resolve this matter out of court, please specify your conditions, and I will ensure they are fulfilled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina nodded. &#34;Fine. Florrie, would you mind recording Mr. Marsh&#39;s commitment? I&#39;ll specify my demands when I&#39;m ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Franklin felt a sense of relief hearing her willingness to negotiate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie made sure to capture this promise on her phone and sent the recording directly to Evelina for safekeeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still upset, Florrie couldn&#39;t hide her disappointment.&#34;I can&#39;t believe Mr. Marsh would go so far to protect Ady. Jasper has always been just and fair,never trivializing human life.&#34; She looked at Evelina with a mix of respect and concern. wondering aloud. &#34;Evelina, are you doing this for Uncle Jasper?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina offered a comforting smile. &#34;My eye will recover in a week. Suing wouldn&#39;t bring grave consequences to Ady anyway. It&#39;s better to earn a favor from the Marsh family now, but I&#39;ll make sure they pay the price in the future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie&#39;s mood lifted on understanding Evelina&#39;s strategy. &#34;Got it, that makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Caleb came to say goodbye to Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained that his aunt was gravely sick, requiring his presence in lreah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina didn&#39;t hold him back. Instead,she subtly sent Florrie on an errand before turning the conversation to a sensitive topic with Caleb. &#34;What really happened to Aurora&#39;s assistant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb tried to dodge the subject at first, but Evelina  interjected, &#34;You&#39;re a lawyer-just stick to the facts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Caleb disclosed the true circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued to defend Jasper&#39;s role. &#34;It truly wasn&#39;t Jasper&#39;s fault that the assistant died...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina listened quietly, well aware from her years in medicine that individuals are drivento despair only in the direst circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew deep down that no one directly involved-herself, Jasper, Ady, or Aurora-was responsible for the ultimate tragedy that befell the assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their actions, while indirect, contributed to the tragic outcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina was sobered by her first encounter with the ruthless dynamics of high society, recognizing the need to maintain a distance from such toxic environments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jasper,alongside lan, was in the midst of critical economic discussions with Aglonard&#39;s mayor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A call from his niece, alerting him that Evelina had regained consciousness, prompted him to return immediately to the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, upon his arrival, he sensed a coolness in Evelina&#39;s demeanor towards him, unsettling him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeking clarity, Jasper discreetly took Florrie aside outside Evelina&#39;s room to inquire about any issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, bound by a promise to Evelina not to burden Jasper with additional worries, including the call from Franklin, chose to divert the conversation. &#34;Cary and Margot came under the guise of visiting Evelina but were actually here to taunt her. Margot, fresh out of detention, was particularly troublesome. I managed to rally some support and sent them packing.&#34;</p>
