                <p>Florrie&#39;s restlessness persisted through the night at the Morningstar villa. No matter how many times she shifted positions in her bed,sleep eluded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the night, Jasper remained by her side,even attempting to sing her lullabies, but to no avail.Florrie&#39;s thoughts were fixated on Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uncle,&#34; she said, &#34;Why don&#39;t you marry Evelina? That way,she can always be with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why won&#39;t you respond?&#34; Florrie continued. &#34;Are you worried you can&#39;t win her heart? But Uncle, you&#39;re the most sought-after bachelor in lreah! It would be shameful for our family if you couldn&#39;t. Admit it, she&#39;s very beautiful, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it just kept going. It wasn&#39;t until well after midnight that Jasper finally got the little chatterbox to drift off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, only a few hours later, she was awake again,persistently pleading for Jasper to bring her to Evelina. Ultimately,Jasper couldn&#39;t resist her relentless desire.Once Florrie had eaten her breakfast, he gathered several boxes of pastries and, accompanied by lan,set off to visit Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan, who had been researching Evelina&#39;s background through the night, was increasingly concerned by what he discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir,&#34; lan said with a serious tone, presenting the accumulated data. &#34;She&#39;s far from ordinary.We might only be seeing the surface of who she really is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Indeed, the scant information they had was sufficient to prove that Evelina Marsh was none other than the famed Sight Weaver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,Jasper approached with a genuine willingness to do whatever necessary to persuade her to treat Florrie,whatever it took to regain his niece&#39;s vision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir...&#34; lan paused, his curiosity getting the better of him. &#34;If Ms. Marsh were open to the idea of marrying you...would you consider it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s look in response was cold enough to silence any further inquiries. Ian quickly held his peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving at Evelina&#39;s hotel suite, they pressed the doorbell and waited. The door eventually opened to reveal- &#34;You stupid jerk! Can&#39;t you take a hint?!&#34; Evelina exclaimed, poised to slam the door shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan hastily wedged his foot in the doorway. &#34;Ms. Marsh,please, look at who&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had his boss personally delivered pastries to a woman. Surely, she could afford thema moment of grace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, plagued by an intense headache,peered at the vague outlines of the two men. &#34;Two of you now?Is my vision doubling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring them, she turned to return to bed, leaving the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t get far. Just a few steps and she faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Marsh!&#34; Jasper exclaimed as he dropped the containers and rushed to catch her. &#34;Evelina? Hey-wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body went slack in his arms, unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper typically avoided touching those he wasn&#39;t familiar with, yet the sight of Evelina&#39;s flushed face and the sweat beading on her forehead compelled him to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her temperature is soaring...&#34; Upon checking, he found her forehead and palms alarmingly hot, clearly feverish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Supposed to be a healer, and can&#39;t manage her own health,&#34; Jaspoer scoffed quietly to himself. Then,decisively, he lifted her into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a rare sight to see Jasper carry any woman,other than his niece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find a coat. We&#39;re taking her to the hospital,&#34; Jasper instructed sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan dashed to the wardrobe. His eyes caught a glimpse of a pill bottle on the nightstand. He paused, reading the label, his features morphing with concern. &#34;Sir,there might&#39;ve been a mix-up with her medication.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning with a coat and the pill bottle, he explained,&#34;It looks like she intended to take something for her fever but mistakenly took something else. That probably worsen her condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s expression darkened. &#34;Contact our family physician immediately. Inform her of the situation,and make sure she&#39;s ready to treat Evelina once we arrive at the villa. Send her the medication details as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lan paused, his eyes widening. &#34;To the villa? You&#39;re taking her there?&#34; He couldn&#39;t hide his astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unheard of-the reserved Jasper Russell was actually bringing a woman to his home?</p>
