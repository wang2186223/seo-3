                <p>Three hours had passed when Jasper&#39;s fever finally subsided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie breathed a deep sigh of relief and grasped Evelina&#39;s hand tightly, her voice filled with heartfelt gratitude. &#34;Evi, I don&#39;t know what we would have done without you! Uncle Jasper was really in a bad way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family doctor, realizing her initial skepticism was misplaced,approached Evelina with a humble apology &#34;Ms. Marsh, I apologize for doubting your methods...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, recognizing the stress the doctor faced,dismissed the apology with a forgiving gesture. &#34;It&#39;s all right, no worries,&#34; she responded warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impressed by Evelina&#39;s gracious demeanor and medical expertise, the doctor couldn&#39;t help but admire her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Jasper stirred awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, Florrie was at his side,her emotions a mix of joy and complaint. &#34;Uncle, you almost gave me a heart attack! We&#39;re so lucky Evi was here! Imagine if something worse had happened-what would wve do without you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jasper regained his bearings, his eyes caught Evelina standing by the window, the morning light casting a halo around her. Time seemed to pause for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper, here, you need to drink this,&#34; Evelina said,pulling him back from his daze as she held the cup to his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie was bubbling with excitement next to him.&#34;Evi made this special herbal concoction for you! It&#39;s a blend of several remedies; she calls it &#39;miracle tea.&#39;If those allergies ever flare up again, this tea&#39;s your quick fix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had anticipated future allergic reactions and came up with a plan. &#34;I&#39;ve passed the recipe to your physician. She&#39;ll prepare it daily and it&#39;ll be ready in a thermos for you to carry around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie sulked a little. &#34;It&#39;s not fair, Evi&#39;s keeping it all for you, Uncle. She won&#39;t even let me try it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper quickly finished his drink, the mild bitterness offset by its soothing effect. As the warmth spread through his body,he felt genuinely relieved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Evelina with a look of deep appreciation &#34;You concoct the medicinal brews? That&#39;s quite impressive. Thank you,really.&#34; Her smile was radiant in response. &#34;It&#39;s my pleasure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jasper seeming cheerful, Evelina decided to broach another topic. &#34;I have a favor to ask. I know Caleb can be overwhelming, but he means well.Please don&#39;t hold his antics against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in Jasper&#39;s expression faltered. Had she been doing all this just to plead Caleb&#39;s case?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the word no just wouldn&#39;t come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I won&#39;t,&#34; he said finally. But the way his fingers clenched around his cup said plenty about how he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s relief was evident. &#34;Thank you, Jasper,&#34; she said,her tension easing visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had not been aware that Caleb&#39;s newly discovered aunt was actually the matriarch of the influential Marsh family, a clan that held sway nearly equal to the Russells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie, bubbling with a sudden idea, leaned closer to Jasper and murmured, &#34;Uncle, Evi just saved your life,risking her own. Don&#39;t you think... maybe you should marry her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then slyly addressed Evelina, giggling softly.&#34;Evelina, you did see him in his most vulnerable state today. Thnat makes you responsible for him, right? If you don&#39;t look after him now, I&#39;lI hold it against you forever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, however, was lost in thought, a distant look in her eyes. &#34;There&#39;s something... I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting something crucial.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie pondered momentarily before her face lit up.&#34;Oh, is it time for lunch? That must be it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging the importance of a meal,Evelina agreed absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as she entered the dining room and caught sight of her phone on the table, the forgotten urgency hit her all at once. She had missed her crucial 8 a.m.appointment at the courthouse to finalize her divorce with Cary.</p>
