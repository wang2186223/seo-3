                <p>&#34;Back off! Get back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a desperate attempt to fend off the danger, Kristina wielded a wine bottle, slashing it through the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mirroring her actions, Florrie shut her eyes tight and swung another bottle across the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Water flew wildly around them, yet the snakes were hardly affected. Suddenly, one snake surged out, aiming directly at Florrie&#39;s arm!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina only realized the imminent danger when she saw the swift, dark shadow approaching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen with fear, Evelina acted swiftly, snatching the snake by its tail and smashing it against the poolside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Ah!&#34; Florrie&#39;s shrieks of fear resonated loudly, adding to the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina quickly cleared the snakes in their way, then guided Kristina and Florrie along the path Aurora had taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed clear that Aurora was behind this; her escape path likely held the key to safety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced that Aurora, terrified of her own demise, had used a snake repellent as she fled, Evelina urged them on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stop, just run!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Kristina and Florrie couldn&#39;t move quickly on their own, Evelina pushed them with all her might.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She struggled but finally ushered them to safety at the pool&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, as she attempted to climb out of the pool herself, a snake latched onto her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot through Evelina&#39;s leg, rendering it numb and her powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina and Florrie grabbed her arms, frantically trying to pull her to safety.Yet Evelina spotted more snakes swiftly closing in. If they continued their attempt to save her, they would all be endangered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, she withdrew her hand and shoved them towards safety. &#34;Go! Forget about me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her remaining energy depleted, Evelina fell back into the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina!&#34; Florrie cried out, wanting to rush back into the pool to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t go.&#34; With a heavy heart, Kristina gripped Florrie&#39;s waist, pulling her away from the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t do anything for Evelina here. We need to get help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seemed like the only viable option, though Kristina doubted whether Evelina could survive that long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miraculously,Evelina burst from the water just as Kristina voiced her fears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living up to her reputation for resilience, she seized a snake and ripped it apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her determination, the sheer number of snakes proved too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, a snake&#39;s fangs sank into her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The venom quickly paralyzed her limb, and soon after, another bite struck her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Evelina&#39;s sight grew foggy and she teetered on the brink of collapse, Jasper demolished the fence dividing the pools.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leapt over the broken barrier and into the women&#39;s pool!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Aurora had arrived at the men&#39;s poool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing caution and pride aside, she burst in-only to witness the man she loved putting his life on the line for someone else!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina! Evelina!&#34; he shouted, fighting through the snakes to reach Evelina, who was nearly fainting.-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jasper?&#34; Evelina&#39;s eyes barely fluttered, her vision too hazy to make out anything but the sound of Jasper&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here!&#34; Fear surged through Jasper as he saw her losing consciousness. &#34;You haven&#39;t said yes to me yet. Stay with me, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the venom was too quick, and Evelina lost consciousness before she could respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay with me, Evelina!&#34; Jasper cried out in despair, his voice thick with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her spot by the ruined fence, Aurora watched, her expression twisted in fury, her hands balled into fists so tight that her knuckles blanched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Jasper so tormented infuriated her. Why? Why should Evelina, of all people, deserve his heart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Evelina deserved to die.</p>
