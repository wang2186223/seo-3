                <p>Around 2:00 AM, when most people were deep in slumber, thick smoke suddenly filled the hotel, and a piercing siren shattered the stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel&#39;s soundproofing was poor. Footfalls thudded along the corridors, joined by frantic voices yelling,&#34;There&#39;s a blaze! Move now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina hadn&#39;t been sleeping deeply-something had kept her half-awake. She snapped to attention before most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing off the covers, she slid into the footwear she&#39;d smartly left beside her and decided to find Jasper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as she pulled open the door, she ran directly into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d just stirred from sleep as well. Driven by instinct, he had come to check on her barefoot, urgency overriding preparation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something off about this,&#34; Evelina said sharply. &#34;This was orchestrated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could elaborate, heavy banging erupted from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stranger shouted from the hallway, &#34;Fire emergency-open up! We&#39;ll escort you to safety!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Evelina pushed Jasper back into his room, voice low but commanding. &#34;Get your shoes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, adopting a drowsy tone, she called out, &#34;Wait, we&#39;re changing! A fire? In Eastmere&#39;s damp chill?Where&#39;s the source?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice outside faltered, struggling to answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew then: there was no inferno-only a ploy to flush out occupants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on already!&#34; the man snapped, irritated. &#34;Forget your belongings-we&#39;re talking survival here!&#34; r had already pulled on his footwear and retrieved the emergency rope he&#39;d hidden earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>d memorized their exit options in advance. Their balcony offered a direct path to the lot below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>cured one end of the cord and gave the other to Evelina. &#34;You first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>nts like these left no room for indecision. Every heartbeat mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>st as Evelina stepped toward the ledge, Aurora emerged from the main bedroom in her luxury othes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>r! What&#39;s going on? What are you doing? Where are you taking her?&#34; she gasped, her gaze locked on as she reached out and grabbed the latter&#39;s wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>s.heart seethed with bitter resentment. In this life-and-death moment, Jasper only thought to take away, completely disregarding Aurora&#39;s presence in the very same room! Did her survival truly mean ?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>faint beep sounded at the door-an electronic keycard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>r was outside had access-and they were coming in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>anked her arm free and shoved Jasper toward the opening. &#34;Climb down. I&#39;ll handle this.&#34; a painful yelp as her face struck the tiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds later, the door burst open and a group of masked intruders flooded into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina reacted instantly-she swept the legs of the first two attackers, sending them crashing down and throwing the others off balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It bought Jasper just enough time to land below. Evelina heard the soft thump of his descent and allowed herself a moment of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the men were enraged. &#34;Damn it, one slipped past us!&#34; one shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking quickly, Evelina gestured toward Aurora and said with icy calm, &#34;She&#39;s the one who helped him escape. Don&#39;t blame me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Aurora not barged in at the worst possible moment, they both might have escaped unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who&#39;s to say the woman hadn&#39;t sabotaged it deliberately?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Evelina could utter another word, the barrel of a gun was pressed against her forehead.&#34;Shut your mouth,&#34; the man snarled. &#34;Take both of them.&#34;</p>
