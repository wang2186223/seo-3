                <p>Aurora felt a flicker of remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But remembering Ady&#39;s lessons, she instantly composed herself, adopting a look of utter bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes grew large, and tears streamed down her cheeks. &#34;Evelina, how could you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still pretending?&#34; Evelina snorted. &#34;That innocent act fits you too well. Maybe you should wear it permanently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t wait for a reply and kept going. &#34;When we were all hauled into the hotel lobby, the robbers cracked open every bag and grabbed anything they could. Every single one-except yours. Untouched. Isn&#39;t that strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora blinked, caught off guard that Evelina had noticed such a minor discrepancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She silently cursed herself for misjudging Evelina, but quickly responded, &#34;Mara packed mine. She knew there was nothing worth stealing in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh please,&#34; Evelina replied with a cold smirk. &#34;Our bags were identical-same color, same shape. And somehow Mara&#39;s crew knew to skip yours? Do you think I&#39;m an idiot?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The criminal who ransacked the upstairs room had gone straight for her luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he didn&#39;t anticipate was the shock device installed inside. The electric jolt forced him back, and in fury,he fired a bullet into the suitcase, ruining the contents-clothing and expensive accessories alike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only silver lining was that the Starry Night earrings were safe with Kristina. Without them, what could she possibly present to ldris?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shouldn&#39;t you question the criminals instead of pointingfingers at me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Jasper&#39;s approach, Aurora&#39;s demeanor softened, and her voice trembled. &#34;Evelia, I know we&#39;ve had our differences, but l&#39;ve let go of the past. I even stepped aside so you could be with Jasper.Why are you still attacking me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina gave a sharp, mocking chuckle. &#34;You let me have him? Do you hear how delusional that sounds?When exactly did Jasper belong to you in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s expression faltered. Her intention had been to make Evelina look pety and unworthy-but somehow, the insult had ricocheted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you insist on playing dangerous games, be ready for the consequences,&#34; Evelina warned. &#34;Jasper will find out what really happened with those four criminals. And I&#39;ll be speaking with your father, Mr. Marsh. He assured me he&#39;d keep his household in check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora stiffened, a shiver running down her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t imagined Evelina would go that far-especially involving her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her adoptive father was blunt and unyielding. He wouldn&#39;t hesitate to interrogate her thoroughly and hold her accountable if anything felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Evelina wasn&#39;t done. Her cold stare met Aurora&#39;s eyes. &#34;The day I was injured, your father tried to avoid a lawsuit, so he granted me one request-no limits. You once told me I wasn&#39;t good enough for Jasper,that only someone from a noble lineage could stand beside him. Well, hear this: that someone will never be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Aurora managed to manipulate her way into becoming Jasper&#39;s only option, Evelina would cash in that promise and make Franklin stop the marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In short, Aurora&#39;s dreams of marrying Jasper were doomed-no matter how hard she schemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re using my father against me?&#34; Aurora sputtered, shaking with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina&#39;s expression didn&#39;t waver. &#34;Even if something happened to me, that promise would become part of my final instructions. It would still reach Mr. Marsh. So tread carefully, Miss Marsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You... you...&#34; Aurora&#39;s body wobbled, and she collapsed-completely overwhelmed.</p>
