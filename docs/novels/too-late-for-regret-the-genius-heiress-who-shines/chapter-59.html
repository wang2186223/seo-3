                <p>&#34;It looks like Margot is still in custody, so Evelina went to the police station to sort things out,&#34; Florrie quickly explained when she noticed Jasper&#39;s anxious expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb went with her, didn&#39;t he? There shouldn&#39;t be any issues,&#34; she added reassuringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s unlikely. Caleb headed off to apologize to Aurora-I saw him myself. Evelina must have gone alone.&#34;Jasper&#39;s unease intensified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After instructing lan to accompany Florrie back to Morningstar Villas, Jasper hurried straight tothe police station.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Marsh was here.&#34; The officer informed Jasper. &#34;But she left almost immediately after arriving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concerned, Jasper asked urgently, &#34;Where did she go after that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t leave any details,&#34; the officer replied apologetically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration welled up in Jasper until one of his bodyguards reminded him, saying, &#34;Mr. Russell, Miss Marsh has been driving our&#39;vehicles lately. They all have GPS trackers installed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Kristina and Jasper owning multiple cars, Evelina never saw the need to get her own. She just drove whichever one was free at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper glanced at his phone and saw that Evelina was definitely using one of the Russell family&#39;s cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What caught his attention, though, was where the car had ended up-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Petal Creek Orphanage,&#34; Jasper murmured, puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This orphanage held Evelina&#39;s childhood memories, but how did Margot&#39;s situation connect to it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the orphanage office, Esme was arrogantly seated in the director&#39;s chair, observing smugly as-the elderly director, Kamryn Ramsey, awkwardly tried to please her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon entering, Evelina witnessed Esme aggressively knocking away a cup of hot tea Kamryn was offering,causing the elderly woman to cry out as it scalded her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve crossed the line, Esme! That qualifies as assault!&#34; Evelina exclaimed sharply, swiftly attending to Kamryn&#39;s burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m alright, Evelina.&#34; Kamryn quickly assured her, masking her pain. &#34;Miss Barton didn&#39;t mean it-please,don&#39;t escalate the situation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Evelina wanted justice, Kamryn&#39;s pleading eyes made her reluctantly drop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme now controlled the orphanage land, and if she wished, could displace hundreds of innocent children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The children&#39;s welfare-housing, food, and education-hung by a thread, making Evelina pause before retaliating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Evelina gently guided Kamryn outside before confronting Esme directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you after, Esme?&#34; Evelina slammed her hands onto the desk, glaring fiercely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard by Evelina&#39;s intensity, Esme shrank back but quickly masked her fear, saying, &#34;I have three demands!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you haven&#39;t overplayed your hand?&#34; Evelina said coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme replied defensively, &#34;I&#39;ve spent fifty million acquiring the rights to this land for five years! If I wanted,these children could all be out on the streets tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cost had been excessively high for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have much money. A while back, she had requested a ten-million-dollar advance from the Russell family for the surgery, but later, their lawyer had managed to take it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t just lose the money-she had to cough up another ten million just to keep them from dragging her to court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina still held her twenty million surgery payment, leaving Esme desperate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selling Starry Night had provided her with a hundred million, and she&#39;d recently handed Cary her last twenty million to help the struggling Gibson Group, only to receive ingratitude in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that remained was the leverage provided by the orphanage&#39;s land rights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Esme was determined to use this leverage to reclaim her losses from Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think you can use this orphanage against me? I&#39;ve survived independently since I was sixteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These children have no personal connection to me,&#34; Evelina said confidently, wearing a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed through Esme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Evelina didn&#39;t actually care about the orphanage, then that fifty million would go straight down the drain!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as panic started creeping in, Esme heard a voice crackle through the hidden earpiece-Aurora&#39;s personal assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device had been tucked into her ear earlier, just in case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having suffered humiliation at Evelina&#39;s hands before, Esme had wisely enlisted powerful assistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With renewed confidence, she retorted sharply, &#34;If you genuinely didn&#39;t care, you wouldn&#39;t have rushed here so desperately after one call. Your biggest flaw has always been your kindness!&#34;</p>
