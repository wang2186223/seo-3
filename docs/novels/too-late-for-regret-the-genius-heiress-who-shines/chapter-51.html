            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Moments ticked away,each second stretching endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after four intense hours and thirty minutes, Florrie&#39;s initial eye operation reached a triumphant conclusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the intervention, two unforeseen hurdles emerged, both requiring meticulous handling. A single error could have resulted in irreversible loss of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Evelina&#39;s deep expertise and remarkable precision navigated the situation flawlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper, waiting restlessly beyond the surgical suite, was visibly tense. Still, he never questioned Evelina&#39;s capabilities-and rightfully so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The surgery went brilliantly! Congratulations, Mr. Russell! Congratulations, Miss Russell!&#34; Warm wishes flooded in from the surrounding crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Specialists from the ophthalmology department, who had observed the entire operation via live feed, stood in ovation. &#34;The Sight Weaver certainly lives up to the legacy of Mr. Mitchell&#39;s top protege. Her real-time judgment and ability to defuse critical moments are unparalleled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No surprise she was chosen as his student-her aptitude far exceeds ours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If only she could perform more operations at our facility-each case is an invaluable lesson we could analyze repeatedly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wonder if she&#39;d be open to mentoring. Our university boasts several gifted students-we&#39;d gladly negotiate terms if she&#39;s interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too eager. Today&#39;s learners aren&#39;t so easy to guide. But if the Sight Weaver agrees to be a guest lecturer, that alone would be a win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to secure her before someone else did, the specialists hastily departed, determined to recruit Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evelina, you&#39;ve done a remarkable job,&#34; Jaspersaid softly, stepping forward to support her as she emerged visibly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t too bad. After this operation, Florrie should regain partial sight, though things will remain a bit hazy for now. She&#39;ll need to recuperate before we can proceed with the next step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her fatigue, Evelina&#39;s expression carried satisfaction. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Jasper. I&#39;ll make sure Florrie fully recovers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome with emotion, Jasper found words difficult. All he could manage was a heartfelt, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina had not only delivered an outstanding surgical performance but had also ensured thorough follow-up arrangements for Florrie&#39;s healing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To ensure her safety, Jasper instructed lan to have the room monitored constantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since it would be a while before Florrie came to, Jasper offered gently, &#34;Let me take you home so you can rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially hesitant, Evelina almost declined. She was never one to show weakness and usually managed alone.But today, being the second day of her menstrual cycle, she felt particularly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; Jasper&#39;s gratitude took her by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled, &#34;Mr. Russell, you&#39;re giving me a ride. Shouldn&#39;t I be the one thanking you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate you letting me help,&#34; he replied. Otherwise, he would feel truly indebted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Evelina seemed untouchable-brilliant, well-connected, self-sufficient. He doubted he had anything meaningful to offer her.②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing sideways, Evelina studied the man beside her as if seeing him anew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always thought Jasper was refined and quietly romantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever was spreading stories about him being cold and heartless clearly had no idea what they were talking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, outside the operating theatre, the Gibson family and Sebastian received news of the operation&#39;s success with cheerful excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora, particularly impatient, intercepted lan. &#34;Where is my future daughter-in-law, Esme? Why hasn&#39;t she come out yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once antagonized Mr. Russell over Evelina and now feared that asking for help with Margot&#39;s release would be denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pinned her hopes on Esme, believing her to be their savior after the successful operation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given Esme&#39;s supposed achievement, Elora assumed any request from her would carry weight with the Russells. Whatever she asked for would surely be granted!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme?&#34; lan sneered and gave the order to bring her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme hadn&#39;t just lied to the Russell family-she had endangered others in the operating room. She couldn&#39;t be let off easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her punishment,however, would be left to Evelina to determine-per Jasper&#39;s directive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Esme, darling, there you are. Please talk to them about Margot...&#34; Elora gushed, not noticing Esme&#39;s strange expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching Esme&#39;s hand, Elora begged her to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme remained stunned, her mind clouded with confusion and a throbbing headache. She had no idea how to face reality.⑦</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elora, it&#39;s been a long and stressful surgery. Give her a moment to breathSebastian said, misreading Esme&#39;s dazed state as a result of fatigue from the high-intensity surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no clue that her deceit had already been unveiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still clinging to his hopes, Sebastian believed Esme might persuade the Russells to make a financial investment,helping him cash in on the stock market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cary,ever thoughtful, handed Esme a thermos. &#34;Here, have some soup. You must be thirsty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gibson Group was struggling, and a mere nod of approval from Mr. Russell could change everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people all mistakenly saw Esme as their shortcut to success, unaware that their dreams were already shattered.</p>
