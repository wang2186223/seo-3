                <p>Realizing the imminent threat, Florrie stood frozen,terror silencing any scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift motion, Evelina shoved Florrie safely aside and lunged forward, her foot slamming powerfully into the thug&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gasped in agony, doubling over, but Evelina gave him no quarter, spinning gracefully into a devastating kick that cracked against his jaw. The man toppled heavily to the floor,groaning weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to keep him disabled, Evelina followed through with another kick before swiftly pulling the van keys from his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Florrie was pushed aside, she collided softly with a worn-out table-exactly as Evelina had intended-just enough to get her clear without injury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still feeling brave?&#34; Evelina asked wryly, offering Florrie a hand up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking her head desperately, Florrie stammered,promise, no more jokes.&#34; They hurriedly retraced their path, escaping from the factory into the night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second girl hadn&#39;t ventured far, hidinganxiously behind a nearby bush, and waved frantically as they emerged. &#34;Hey, over here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina rushed toward her, concern clear in her eyes.&#34;You alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl nodded quickly. Relieved, Evelina guided both girls toward the parked van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Keys in hand, she reached for the door, hopeful of a quick escape- until brilliant headlights suddenly pierced the darkness,stopping them cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering her eyes, Evelina squinted into the blinding beams,recognizing the grim reality-an entire group of thugs now encircled them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the forefront stood a young man with slicked-back hair,arrogance radiating from his designer clothes. He smirked coldly. &#34;Impressive. Nobody&#39;s ever escaped my top guys before. There&#39;s a first time for everything,I suppose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m scared,&#34; Florrie whispered nervously, picking up the sinister laughter and footsteps around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me too,&#34; the other girl responded, trembling behind  Evelina&#39;s protective stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay calm,&#34; Evelina said firmly, squeezing Florrie&#39;s hand reassuringly. Meeting the gang leader&#39;s eyes directly, she suggested evenly, &#34;You&#39;re Mr. Reid,correct? Whatever Margot&#39;s paying you, l&#39;ll double it -no,five times as much. Name your price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attempting to protect the strangers she&#39;d rescued,Evelina was willing to bargain even with criminals. &#34;Let us leave unharmed, and I&#39;ll pretend tonight never happened.Margot won&#39;t hear from me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hayden erupted in laughter. &#34;Do you seriously believe we&#39;d let you go after you&#39;ve seen our faces?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a swift, decisive gesture, he instructed, &#34;Finish them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, more than twenty thugs surged forward,weapons glinting ominously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two terrified girls screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Florrie considered desperately revealing her identity,but the fear of escalating their danger held her tongue.Could disclosing her status as a Russell only seal their fate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina braced for the brutal fight ahead, calmly stretching her muscles. She turned confidently to the frightened girls. &#34;You both know how to count, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, they nodded hesitantly. &#34;Yes...?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina pointed toward a sturdy tree nearby,instructing the girl with sight, &#34;Get behind that tree with Florrie and start counting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the girl hesitated,Evelina shouted sharply, &#34;Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled into action, she grabbed Florrie&#39;s hand and hurried toward the tree, turning briefly to Evelina.&#34;Please be careful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina flashed a confident thumbs-up. &#34;Cover your ears. Count to one hundred.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fearless determination, she then charged straight into the enemy ranks like a predator unleashed.</p>
