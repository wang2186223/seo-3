                <p>Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina&#39;s luxurious presidential suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved,with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly,requesting Evelina&#39;s presence at the Gibson Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t difficult to guess the reason behind the call -no doubt it concerned the divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina,however,suspected something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said, &#34;I doubt it&#39;s that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell&#39;s elusive protege -the Sight Weaver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I&#39;m concerned she might try to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina quickly reassured her. &#34;Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina remained cautious. &#34;Just make sure the Gibson family don&#39;t take advantage of your skills again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be careful,&#34; Evelina replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, &#34;You won&#39;t be meeting them looking like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. &#34;Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared,replaced by clarity and allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup,Evelina transformed dramatically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, &#34;Cary must&#39;ve been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Precisely on time, the Gibson family&#39;s chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asher, the family&#39;s longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn&#39;t recognize Evelina at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. &#34;Ms. Marsh?&#34; He stumbled over his words. &#34;You look absolutely extraordinary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this Miss Russell herself?&#34; Margot hurried forward,her expression instantly switching to flattery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked Jasper&#39;s arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that grace and confidence,who else could she be but a Russell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked.&#34;Evelina&#39;s tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot&#39;s mouth dropped open. &#34;It&#39;s you?&#34; she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that precise moment, another vehicle approached.Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few days had passed-how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless,compelling beauty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Cary&#39;s astonishment, Esme&#39;s jaw tightened,though she maintained her gentle smile. &#34;That&#39;s your ex-wife, isn&#39;t it?&#34; she said softly. &#34;Since we&#39;ve run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap-acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. &#34;Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary&#39;s accounts for your new face and that designer dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, &#34;Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back?You&#39;re delusional!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina&#39;s dress and hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, &#34;Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today-this isn&#39;t appropriate behavior for a Gibson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Asher&#39;s plea, Margot shouted furiously, &#34;I&#39;ll rip that smug face of yours apart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone,recording Margot&#39;s tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, &#34;Keep going. Let&#39;s show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t dare!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme,feigning vulnerability.&#34;Esme,please protect me.We&#39;ll be family soon-you have to defend me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She emphasized &#34;family&#34; deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot&#39;s hair as if comforting a child. &#34;It&#39;s alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina scoffed sharply, &#34;Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Esme&#39;s expression turned rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot quickly retorted, &#34;Who&#39;s the outsider? You&#39;re the one who doesn&#39;t belong here!&#34; Turning to Cary,she said, &#34;Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can&#39;t let her bully us like that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. &#34;It&#39;s okay.Evelina didn&#39;t have parents to teach her manners-it&#39;s not her fault. Cary, please don&#39;t blame her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme&#39;s implication.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Cary saw none of Evelina&#39;s frustration. In his eyes,Esme&#39;s gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, &#34;If you think causing trouble will win you points, you&#39;re mistaken. It&#39;s pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apologize to Esme right now.&#34;</p>
