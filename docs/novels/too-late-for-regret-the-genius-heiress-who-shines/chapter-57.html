                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; Evelina reacted with disbelief. &#34;I submitted the forgiveness letter more than ten days ago.This shouldn&#39;t be happening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Margot should have been home with the Gibson family already, given the timeline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Demi,stay calm. I&#39;ll personally check what&#39;s going on at the police station.&#34; Evelina assured Demi before promptly preparing to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll accompany you,&#34; Caleb insisted. As her lawyer, he naturally felt responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had they exited Florrie&#39;s room than a furious call from Ady Marsh interrupted them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, Ady had nearly lost her life to kidney failure, and Aurora was the only suitable donor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Aurora donated her kidney, significantly compromising her health, earning immense affection and gratitude from Ady, surpassing even her real granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caleb, I&#39;ve overlooked your behavior so far because you&#39;re Vivienne&#39;s family, but your arrogance ends here!How dare you upset Aurora so badly that she fainted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among her three daughters-in-law, Vivienne displeased Ady the most, primarily because Vivienne&#39;s husband,Franklin, indulged her excessively, undermining Ady&#39;s authority.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understand clearly: This isn&#39;t over. Go apologize to Aurora immediately, and don&#39;t stop until she forgives you! Moreover, I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re associating with a divorced woman-end it immediately. You represent the Marsh family now; behave accordingly and steer clear of questionable women!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a younger family member, Caleb listened patiently before calmly replying, &#34;Thank you for your advice,but we aren&#39;t close enough for you to dictate my personal life choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your brat!&#34; Ady erupted furiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely unfazed, Caleb said smoothly, &#34;If that&#39;s all, I&#39;ll hang up now. Goodbye, Mrs. Marsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cousins had repeatedly warned him about Ady&#39;s formidable nature and her tight grip over the Marsh family for decades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb considered himself sufficiently respectful; after all, he ended the caIl politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelina, however, immediately saw through his act. &#34;You deliberately provoked Ady to redirect her attention from me, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb innocently shrugged. &#34;Me? NNever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Appreciatively, Evelina patted his shoulder. &#34;Thank you, Caleb. But Ady is your aunt&#39;s mother-in-law. Don&#39;t create trouble for her on my behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Caleb prepared a response, his phone started ringing nonstop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His cousin, Damien, was calling, sounding extremely upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know my grandmother dislikes Mom, so why would you provoke Aurora? Grandma came personally to scold us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He firmly instructed Caleb, &#34;Apologize to Aurora immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not!&#34; Caleb stubbornly refused. &#34;Besides, Jasper was also involved. Why isn&#39;t she confronting the Russell family instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, Damien massaged his temples on the other end. &#34;Mom&#39;s health is fragile. Do you really want to force her to lower herself before Grandma because of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb hesitated, feeling deeply concerned for his aunt. &#34;Aurora is obviously faking-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If Grandma believes Aurora fainted, then she fainted. Don&#39;t you realize that?&#34; Damien&#39;s voice echoed loudly enough for Evelina to overhear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After brief contemplation, Evelina said, &#34;Caleb, perhaps it&#39;s best to apologize. Aurora worked hard staging this fainting episode. If you don&#39;t play along, she&#39;ll lose face, giving Ady more reason to trouble your aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding the logic, Caleb reluctantly gave in. &#34;Fine, but it&#39;s purely for my aunt&#39;s sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damien&#39;s tone softened noticeably. &#34;Who&#39;s the woman with you? Let me speak with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb held out the phone, placing it on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, this is Damien Marsh, third son of the Marsh family. I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re the reason behind my cousin&#39;s conflict with Aurora?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for Evelina&#39;s reply, Damien continued bluntly, &#34;Name your price. What will it take for you to leave my cousin alone?&#34;</p>
