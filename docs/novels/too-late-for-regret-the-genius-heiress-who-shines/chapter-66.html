                <p>Caleb&#39;s sudden appearance startled Aurora, her face betraying a flash of disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Jasper not coming after all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and her assistant had orchestrated this scene,hoping to convince Jasper of her innocence in the attack on Evelina. She feared that without his belief, Jasper would never forgive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora, with the theatricality honed over the years within the Marsh family, faced Caleb&#39;s accusations in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning weakly against the bedpost, she occasionally coughed and tears rolled down her cheeks without a sound. Beside her, the kneeling assistant was desperate to keep their planned deception from unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly grabbed Caleb&#39;s sleeve, crying.She said,&#34;Mr. Quinn, please, the fault is mine alone. I acted without Miss Marsh&#39;s knowledge. Blame me, and me alone, just please don&#39;t turn me over to Mr. Russell...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re terrified of me, yet you still chose to strike at someone under the protection of the Russell family?&#34; Jasper entered, pinpointing the contradiction in her plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, the assistant shook with genuine fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off-guard, she momentarily forgot the lines she had rehearsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora said, &#34;You need to face Jasper and accept responsibility for your actions. I&#39;m not covering for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s words made the assistant regain some poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the assistant&#39;s voice shook as she said, &#34;I admit, it was my doing. I thought a minor scare for Evelina wouldn&#39;t draw attention. I didn&#39;t foresee such severe consequences...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper was quickly losing his temper with the excuses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His only concern was clear. &#34;Tell me, who put you up to this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No one instructed me!&#34; The assistant&#39;s voice was firm,her demeanor fraught with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper sensed her resistance to the truth. He signaled someone off to the side. &#34;Give her a taste of her own medicine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his command, a formidable bodyguard from the Russell family stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant, now visibly shaken, clutched at Aurora&#39;s gown. &#34;Please, Miss Marsh, protect me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb, witnessing the scene, directed his fury towards Aurora. &#34;So it was your doing! What else do you have to say for yourself?&#34; Aurora, seeming resigned, merely said, &#34;I... have nothing to say.&#34; There was not a trace of guilt or unease on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caleb was taken aback by this development.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible they had accused the wrong person?He glanced at Jasper, searching for clues in his demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard attempted to detain the assistant,who resisted fiercely, clinging to Aurora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora&#39;s voice cut through the tension, exclaiming,&#34;Enough!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stooped to her assistant&#39;s level, her tone stern yet protective. &#34;You must own up to your actions. It&#39;s time to tell Jasper everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant wavered, then firmly shook her head.&#34;No, Miss Marsh, I can&#39;t reveal it. My family will suffer if I do...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a moment of desperation, she wrenched herself free from the bodyguard and charged towards the  room&#39;s cabinet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head collided with its sharp edge, and she collapsed as blood began to pour from the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora was horrified. &#34;What have you done? Why would you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frantically, she grabbed a cloth and pressed it against the assistant&#39;s head to stem the bleeding,crying out for help. &#34;Doctor! We need a doctor here immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora called out repeatedly without a response,then pleaded with Jasper, &#34;Jasper, please,help her.We can sort everything else out later, just save her first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jasper&#39;s expression remained stoic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a burst of desperation, Aurora shouted, &#34;It was me,I ordered her to do it! I&#39;ll make it right with Evelina,just save her now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a nod from Jasper, the bodyguard stepped aside, allowing a doctor to rush in and attend to the at most assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the assistant was being carried away, her grasp loosened, dropping a pink hairpin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aurora snatched it up, holding it delicately. &#34;This belongs to her sister. They lost their parents, and she&#39;s all she has left.&#34; Meanwhile, Jasper was already on the phone,instructing his family&#39;s investigators in lreah to look into the assistant&#39;s sister&#39;s situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the room, he found Aurora slumped by the bed, her gaze lost on the bloodied cabinet.&#34;Jasper, loving you was my biggest mistake...&#34;</p>
