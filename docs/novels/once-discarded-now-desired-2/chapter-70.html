                <p>Besty removed her hand from Emma&#39;s grip in terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Todd, I don&#39;t actually know you, so mind how you speak,&#34; Besty said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma blinked in shock. &#34;Besty! How can you say that? You&#39;re supposed to be close to my sister-in-law!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could hardly believe Emma&#39;s cluelessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Lillian folded her arms, her eyes fixed on the scene, clearly waiting for the drama to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty quickly explained, worried Eleanor might get the wrong idea, &#34;You mean Miss Gilbert, right? I barely know her. She just claimed she spent $10 million at Enigma Group, called herself our top VIP, and insisted l come. Otherwise,I wouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t personal. Eleanor had told her to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, even if Lainey had splashed out a hundred million, she wouldn&#39;t have bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These folks were completely out of touch with the real world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd went quiet instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, Lainey wasn&#39;t friends with Besty at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty didn&#39;t even know her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some rich women&#39;s faces darkened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had never needed to ask for favors before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here they were, bending over backward for Lainey just because of Besty, and now this? Ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey instinctively recoiled under all the angry, scrutinizing eyes. To make matters worse, Jonny looked genuinely furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes blazed with anger as he glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been counting on Lainey to leverage Enigma Group for some valuable connections, but instead,not only was the ten million gone, but also their family&#39;s reputation had been completely ruined!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey...he had to admit, she had a way of getting under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the couple about to clash, Lillian felt a secret thrill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin and addressed Lainey, speaking louder on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a minute... you and Besty weren&#39;t even friends? So all this time you were just using her name to show off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Besty&#39;s comment had embarrassed Lainey, Lillian&#39;s statement practically nailed the lie in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The socialites, realizing they had been played, erupted with anger, demanding Lainey explain herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny rubbed his temples in exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth had a simple wedding turned into this disaster?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun toward Eleanor, his gaze dark and unwavering.&#34;Look, I get it. You&#39;re upset, but it&#39;s done. Making a scene won&#39;t change a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. &#34;Just calm down, don&#39;t stir trouble, and I&#39;Il make it right later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked in disbelief. Was he seeing things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made him think she was making a scene, and that she still cared for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he completely ignored Lillian&#39;s words?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lainey was boiing with jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had heard what Jonny said. He still had feelings for Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So where did that leave her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could react, a cold, teasing voice cut in. &#34;Really, with me here, do you think she&#39;d still be interested in you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had approched Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes flicked toward Jonny, flat and dismissive, like he was watching a fool make a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, of all people, openly claimed interest in Eleanor in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was practically a challenge thrown in his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made no sense. Eleanor wasn&#39;t the kind of woman people fought over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t glamorous like Lainey, and even Emma outshone her by miles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Nolan possibly single her out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Jonny nor Eleanor could figure out what Nolan was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were only causing more confusion than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wanting no part of it, Eleanor decided she had had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed Lillian by the arm and theý made their way towards the exit, ignoring the chaos around.them.</p>
