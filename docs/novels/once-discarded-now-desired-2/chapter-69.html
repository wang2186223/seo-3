                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t budge, but Nolan subtly moved to stand in front of her, like a protective barrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, suddenly realizing Nolan was there, froze mid-step. &#34;Nolan! She&#39;s picking on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was a mix of indignation and disbelief. She was still caught in her own dramatic fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, finally losing patience, folded her arms and gave Emma a sharp, evaluating look. &#34;Miss Todd, maybe check yourself in a mirror before running to Nolan crying,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>she said, her tone dripping with sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a cruel edge, she added, &#34;Honestly, you look absolutely ridiculous right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compelled almost against her will, Emma grabbed a mirror. One quick glance and her face went pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her makeup had completely melted, and smears of color ran across her cheeks and forehead. It was a total disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to face anyone like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is all your fault, you bitch!&#34; she yelled, her hands over her face, her eyes shooting daggers at Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise and chaos immediately drew Jonny&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gestured to the guests to stay back and made his way toward the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Emma&#39;s ruined appearance, Jonny frowned. &#34;What in the world happened here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, quick to seize the moment, pretended to be concerned. Still smiling, she handed Emma a tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried just enough emotion to sound genuine. &#34;Jonny, I&#39;m so sorry. I got so caught up talking to Besty that I didn&#39;t notice Emma.&#34; Lainey turned to look at Eleanor. &#34;Miss Warren, I know you might still be upset with us, but today is our wedding-a happy day for all of us. Whatever grudges you have, you shouldn&#39;t take them out on Emma.She&#39;s still young. If she did something wrong, you could just talk to her instead of hurting her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but smirk, impressed by Lainey&#39;s talent for twisting the truth. &#34;Lainey, I have to admit.You&#39;ve gotten really good at turning things around to make yourself look innocent,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the two women squared off, ready to exchange sharp words again, Jonny felt his patience snap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Eleanor a hard look, his voice tight with frustration. &#34;Eleanor, I get that my remarriage might bother you, but there&#39;s a line. You can&#39;t make things hard for Emma, and you definitely can&#39;t show up at our wedding like this.Apologize.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, standing nearby, was barely containing her disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could the whole Todd family really be this ridiculous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nerve of them! She shook her head, feeling her temper flare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shouted at Jonny, &#34;You think Eleanor still have feelings for you? That&#39;s ridiculous. And what nonsense is this about crashing your wedding? You sent the invitations yourself. Have you already forgotten? Or maybe your new wife stirred up trouble with Eleanor behind your back, and you were clueless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added, &#34;And let&#39;s not forget-it was your sister who splashed wine on Eleanor first! And now you expect her to just stand there? You&#39;re all such clueless fools!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lillian weren&#39;t a woman of high standing, she might have spat in his face on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, meanwhile, felt his face heat up with embarrassment and frustration. He wasn&#39;t sure if Lillian was speaking the truth or just trying to stir conflict between him and Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind reeled, leaving him frozen in indecision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, it was the Brooks family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t risk offending them. Besty, who had been quietly observing the chaos, finally pieced it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Lainey wasn&#39;t really Eleanor&#39;s friend-she had been a rival all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant everything she had thought before was completely wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could process it further, Emma clung to her arm, her voice full of urgency and desperation.&#34;Besty! You have to help me! Before, you were kind and didn&#39;t want to stoop to Eleanor&#39;s level, but now look at her! She&#39;s taken advantage of me and bullied me even more! You have to teach her a lesson for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way was she going to drag herself into this mess just because of Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not happening.</p>
