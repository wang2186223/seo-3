                <p>Eleanor assembled a meal, carefully placing it inside an insulated lunchbox, before picking up the phone to call Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I prepared some food. Could you deliver it to Nolan?&#34; she asked. &#34;His stomach is delicate, and he mustn&#39;t go hungry while working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched across the line, leaving Eleanor uneasy and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After wvhat felt like an eternity, Erick&#39;s tensed voice finally came through. &#34;Miss Warren, I&#39;m afraid Mr.Stewart isn&#39;t seeing anyone at the moment, including me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Erick, who had spent the most time by Nolan&#39;s side, was now kept distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy wave of concern weighed on Eleanor. She  pictured Nolan buried in stress, carrying a burden far greater than most could imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I understand.&#34; Eleanor ended the call,her brows drawn tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, she couldn&#39;t allow matters to continue this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, she resolved to return to the villa in Regal Heights, knowing he would eventually come back for clothes and vital documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With resolve firm, Eleanor turned to Lilah. &#34;Lilah,pack our bags. We&#39;re leaving for Regal Heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah hesitated briefly, then nodded with understanding, replying politely, &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had made the right choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning, Nolan had returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fatigue clung to him, his appearance exhausted and drained. Eleanor nearly leapt from the sofa,rushing to his side. &#34;You&#39;re finally home,&#34; she said, her voice threaded with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lifted a hand, brushing her cheek with gentle care. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m back,&#34; he murmured, his voice hoarse and eyes bloodshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For days, Nolan had buried himself in endless work,using every task as a shield against his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet during the quiet hours of the night, only her face haunted his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to worry Eleanor and feared that revealing the Stewart Group&#39;s dire crisis would shatter her peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he shut himself off, avoiding everyone,determined to fix everything swiftly and appear before her unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t anticipated Eleanor waiting for him at the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pulled her close, resting his chin lightly on her shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Things are starting to improve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his hesitation to explain, Eleanor stayed silent, refraining from asking for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded and leaned into his embrace silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they parted, Erick rushed in, his expression shadowed with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, bad news. Our team discovered the company&#39;s tax situation is indeed troubling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s stomach sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Companies could survive occasional setbacks, but a tax investigation by authorities was devastating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the accusation became official, any future government contracts would vanish for the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The family&#39;s century-long reputation risked ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s face remained composed, though his eyes sharpened to ice. &#34;Continue,&#34; he instructed. Erick said quickly, &#34;After Wray assumed control, the newly appointed CFO, Sheppard, exploited his position to fabricate accounts and siphon off significant tax funds. The Internal Revenue Service has collected evidence and is preparing charges.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s carelessness had invited disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s stare hardened as he issued precise orders.&#34;Immediately secure all surveillance and digital records from Sheppard&#39;s office. Have the legal team work overnight to compile proof that his actions were personal, not company-related. Also, calculate the tax shortfall and settle it at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick, who had been tense moments ago, found direction in Nolan&#39;s clarity. &#34;Understood, Mr.Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He departed swiftly,moving without hesitation.</p>
