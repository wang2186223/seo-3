                <p>Plenty of people celebrated the news, but there were just as many who met it with disbelief and outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey,upon catching sight of the headline, froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read,&#34;Enigma is Butterfly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could read every character in that headline,yet somehow, the meaning just wouldn&#39;t click for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What other secrets was Eleanor hiding? And why did she get to live such a dazzling life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy twisted inside Lainey, and she resolved to put an end to Eleanor&#39;s time in the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching her jaw, she dug out a phone with an old,unused number and made a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a man answered, his tone teasing. &#34;Baby,I thought you&#39;d already settled down. What&#39;s made you call me out of the blue?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her disgust,Lainey put on a syrupy sweet voice. &#34;Horace, I need you to take care of someone  for me. Whatever it costs, I&#39;ll pay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace Boyd came with a reputation, and he sounded interested. &#34;Really now? Who&#39;s foolish enough to get on your bad side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred burned in Lainey&#39;s eyes as she bit down on her lip. &#34;I&#39;ll message you the specifics soon. Just say if you&#39;re up for the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace let out a deep, amused laugh. &#34;There&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t handle. As long as you can get me in with the Benton family, I&#39;ll take care of anyone you point me toward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace operated in the criminal underworld, while the Benton family had always built their reputation on strictly lawful business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Linking those two worlds wouldn&#39;t be simple, but it was definitely within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the self-proclaimed star of the Benton family,Lainey believed she was more than capable of making it happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another thought, she agreed right, away,&#34;You&#39;ve got a deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eleanor was blissfully unaware of Lainey&#39;s schemes. All her attention was on calming down David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! You went to appear on TV with Dyer? Do l even matter to you as a teacher anymore?&#34; David&#39;s angry voice blasted through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weary sigh, Eleanor pressed her fingers to her temple and pushed the phone away from her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened as she tried to reassure him.&#34;David,&#39;I know l made a mistake. It won&#39;t happen again,I swear. Please don&#39;t get worked up, or I&#39;ll start to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then continued, &#34;Dyer&#39;s only acting this way because he&#39;s jealous of you. Honestly, he wishes he had a student like me, so he&#39;s just trying to stir things up. Don&#39;t let him get under your skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little patience and reassurance was all it took for David&#39;s anger to melt away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered a few last complaints before offering some advice to Eleanor. &#34;Otrad&#39;s got a harsh, dry climate, and sandstorms aren&#39;t uncommon. Look after yourself. Don&#39;t think you can just ignore these things because you&#39;re still young.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warmth blossomed in Eleanor&#39;s chest, and a small smile broke across her face. &#34;I will, I promise.&#34; Once the call ended, she let out a long sigh and sank into the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, everyone was settled for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It struck her that she really needed to be more cautious going forward and keep her other lives a secret,or else she would have more trouble than she could handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a few moments to recharge, Eleanor begansorting her things for the journey to Otrad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, her phone lit up with a text from Nolan. &#34;When are you heading out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on Eleanor&#39;s lips as she tapped out her response. &#34;I&#39;m catching a flight tomorrow morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t make her wait long. &#34;Let me know the moment you land. I&#39;m going to miss you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those final words touched her more than she expected, prompting Eleanor to reply, &#34;I will. The connection isn&#39;t great over there, but I&#39;ll text you the moment I get a better signal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking that would be the end of their exchange,Eleanor set her phone aside, until it buzzed once more. Nolan had sent another message. &#34;Look outside.I&#39;m downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made Eleanor freeze for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried to the window, pulling the curtain aside just enoughto peek outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the glow of the streetlamp, Nolan&#39;s Bentley was parked below. He was there, leaning casually against the car, his eyes fixed on her window.</p>
