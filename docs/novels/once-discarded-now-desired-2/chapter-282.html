                <p>Nolan drifted through a haze of thoughts before steering toward Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exiting the car, he spotted Hilda lingering by the gate,hesitant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands gripped a thermal container, pacing with nervous energy, fingers brushing the doorbell before recoiling,her face a map of uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan took measured steps toward her. &#34;Mrs.Benton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers clutched tighter, voice catching before she said, &#34;I heard the Stewart Group is safe. ls Eleanor coping all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Jeff had taken the liberty of intervening to help the Stewart Group without announcing themselves, and she now fretted Eleanor might see it as an intrusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to spare her daughter from worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the anxiety in her eyes, Nolan stepped aside,clearing the doorway.&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda shook her head sharply, startled. &#34;No, no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thrust the container into Nolan&#39;s hands. &#34;I prepared this myself. You and Eleanor enjoy it. I won&#39;t overstep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, she moved on swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few steps away, she looked back, eyes glimmering with tearful tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, container in hand, remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He entered the living room where Eleanor lounged on the couch,absorbed in her book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His footsteps drew her attention, and her gaze fell on the container, pausing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t takeout. This came from the Bentons. Nolan spread the dishes on the dining table.&#34;Eleanor, dinner&#39;s ready,&#34; he called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set her book aside, moving slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why hadn&#39;t Hilda come inside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it hesitation, or fear of seeing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stopped at the table, hands frozen above the cutlery. &#34;Where&#39;s Mrs. Benton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan placed the last dish down and hesitated briefly. &#34;She didn&#39;t want to bother you and left,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy weight pressed on Eleanor&#39;s chest, and her eyes fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped closer, covering her cold hand with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sensed the tension inside her-the tug between longing and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over twenty years, Eleanor had walked alone. Looking into her eyes, Nolan said softly, &#34;Eleanor,whatever path you choose, I&#39;m here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed silent, lifting her fork to taste the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this really be her mother&#39;s cooking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never eaten it before, yet it carried a sense of familiarity, like a memory she had always carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit slowly, her thoughts wandering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the meal, Nolan tidied the table while Eleanor stepped outside for a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in thought, she wandered until the orphanage gate appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah stood in the courtyard, enjoying the evening breeze.Spotting Eleanor, she waved warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped inside, drew a stool close, and lay her head on Myah&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She truly didn&#39;t. Her mind replayed Myah&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing a child weighed hardest on parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the Bentons&#39; kindness vividly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor knew they had quietly acted to save the Stewart Group. She hadn&#39;t spoken it, yet gratitude ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, accepting it felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two decades of absence didn&#39;t vanish in a night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word&#34;parents&#34; feIt heavy, strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their sudden return left Eleanor unbalanced, caught between fear and confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling Eleanor&#39;s light shiver, Myah touched her back tenderly.&#34;My dear, you already know what you want,don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s smile softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You keep returning here, looking through that notebook, not to prove they abandoned you, right?You&#39;re really looking for proof they cared, that letting you go was never meant to happen. Perhaps things were misunderstood in the beginning. But deep down, their love reached you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lowered her gaze slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had returned repeatedly, seeking roots, needing reassurance that she wasn&#39;t forsaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That faded photograph, delicate outfit, wooden rabbit...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All whispered of a love once present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t dared confront it until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Eleanor lifted her eyes, misty yet determined. &#34;I get it now, Myah,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah saw the clarity in her expression and smiled with relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had finally conquered her fears and stepped  forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home, my dear. Your parents are waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising, Eleanor bowed deeply to the woman who had nurtured her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she walked out, passing through the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached the gate, she caught sight of the familiar figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the streetlight, Nolan lingered, the soft radiance crowning him in a faint halo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, made no move to hurry her-simply watched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped closer, warm fingers enclosing her cold hand. &#34;Eleanor, where are we headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her final trace of doubt melted as she met his gaze.&#34;To the Bentons&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile curved Nolan&#39;s lips as he tightened his grip. &#34;Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
