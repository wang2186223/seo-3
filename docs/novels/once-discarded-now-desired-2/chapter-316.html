                <p>At the hospital, following a thorough examination, the doctor delivered reassuring news. Norwood&#39;s collapse was simply stress-induced exhaustion. Rest would restore him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie arrived the following day, breathless and apologetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rushing to the bedside, she clasped her grandfather&#39;s hand, tears glistening in her eyes. &#34;Grandpa, forgive me for being so late. Yesterday evening, Elora andI were camping in the suburbs. My phone battery died,so I had no idea you&#39;d been hospitalized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded Norwood&#39;s features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming her grandfather&#39;s memory might be foggy, Fannie began explaining. &#34;Grandpa, surely you remember? Elora Guyton is living with Nolan now. Poor thing has endured so much tragedy. First her father died, then she escaped an abusive relationship while fighting severe depression. You can&#39;t imagine how close we came to losing her just days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition finally dawned on Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years had passed since he had last seen Elora, when she was merely a child playing alongside Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, her worthless father had dragged her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she was residing at the Regal Heights villa?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What possessed Nolan to make such a decision?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Housing a servant&#39;s daughter who shared no family blood. Surely Eleanor would be furious about this arrangement? Nolan appeared in the doorway moments later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without acknowledging his grandson&#39;s entrance, Norwood spoke bluntly. &#34;You&#39;ve taken Elora Guyton in?Send her away within forty-eight hours. Should childhood sentiment cloud your judgment, provide her money and sever all ties.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan suspected his grandfather viewed Elora as another opportunist seeking to exploit the Stewart name.Patiently, he offered his defense. &#34;Grandpa, Elora possesses genuine integrity. She harbors no hidden agenda. Shortly, I&#39;ll bring her to visit you. Once you spend time with her, you&#39;ll recognize her true character.Remember your initial reservations about Eleanor? Yet see how wonderfully that relationship has flourished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disbelief flickered across Norwood&#39;s weathered face. His grandson&#39;s reasoning bordered on absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business dealings revealed Nolan&#39;s razor-sharp intellect, yet personal relationships left him utterly blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Elora held no family connection whatsoever. How could Eleanor possibly accept such an arrangement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, he had questioned Eleanor&#39;s absence during the hospital visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now everything made perfect sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flashed in his eyes. &#34;Age has weakened my authority over you. Mark my words though. Don&#39;t expect sympathy when Eleanor walks away for good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie lingered nearby, catching fragments of their heated exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze shifted between her brother and grandfather before she ventured carefully. &#34;Nolan, you&#39;ve been neglecting Eleanor recently. Everyone knows couples require private moments together. Constantly socializing with Elora and me will surely irritate Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood dismissed the conversation with an impatient gesture. &#34;I&#39;ve spoken my mind. Leave now, I require rest. The Benton family treasure their daughter dearly. I doubt they still permit this marriage after your behavior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling away from them, Norwood closed his eyes firmly. Nolan departed the room, his mind churning with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s recent coldness suddenly gained new meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instructing Fannie to remain with their grandfather, Nolan rushed toward the exit.</p>
