                <p>Inside the CEO&#39;s office of the Todd Group, Jonny Todd slid a set of papers across the desk toward Eleanor Todd. &#34;Here&#39;s the divorce agreement. Go through it, and if everything looks fine, sign your name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes lingered on the papers, shadowed with emotions she kept hidden. &#34;Do we truly have to end our marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Jonny arched his brows, amusement flickering in his tone. &#34;What else were you hoping for? Our marriage only existed to make my grandmother happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While speaking, he reached for the hand of the woman at his side, his voice softening. &#34;And now that Lainey has returned, I need to restore her place and give her the respect she deserves.&#34;  Eleanor slowly raised her head, her gaze falling on the woman who had always lived in her husband&#39;s heart-Lainey Gilbert. Lainey was Jonny&#39;s childhood friend and ex-girlfriend. Three years earlier, the Todd family and the Gilbert family had planned an engagement for Jonny and Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the engagement ceremony could happen,Jonny was in a car crash that left his legs broken,with doctors warning he might never walk again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the news reached the Gilberts, they abruptly canceled the arrangement and sent Lainey overseas.Yet even with their callous rejection, Jonny never erased Lainey from his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her sudden return, he was impatient to dissolve his marriage with Eleanor and welcome Lainey as his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey stood in a light white dress, dimples flashing as she smiled, looking every bit like a fragile bloom in full beauty. She carried a beauty that was hard to deny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made perfect sense that Jonny had clung to her image all these years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor said nothing, Lainey faced her with apparent sincerity. &#34;Mrs. Todd, Jonny and I share real love. I hope you&#39;ll give us your blessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet how could love be genuine when she had abandoned him the moment he was crippled, only to return once he recovered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dry laugh slipped from Eleanor as her eyes shifted toward Jonny. &#34;A divorce is fine. But after what I&#39;ve done for your family all those three years, I won&#39;t leave empty-handed.I expect fair compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Sallie Todd had once helped her in the orphanage, Eleanor had agreed without hesitation when the old woman asked her to marry her grandson, Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, she had poured herself into the role of a loyal wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even grown a faint affection for him while watching his efforts to stand on his own again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But despite her devotion, three years had done nothing to soften his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting go now was the only path left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, her part in pushing the Todd Group to its successful listing was no small matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not allow her hard work to vanish without acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny laughed under his breath as he lit a cigarette,his features sharpening in the haze of smoke. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. Sign the papers, and you&#39;ll have $70 million along with a riverside villa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Eleanor meant little to him, he couldn&#39;t ignore the fact that she had stayed by his side while his legs were useless. That was enough to settle the debt between them. &#34;I&#39;ll give you two days to think. If you want anything more...&#34; he began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need.&#34; Eleanor lifted the pen with steady grace and signed her name. &#34;By tomorrow morning,I&#39;ll move out and leave the place open for you and Miss Gilbert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny felt a spark of satisfaction at her decisiveness.Even he could not deny that Eleanor had been the model wife. She was beautiful, compliant, and skilled at keeping the household in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet to him, her nature was unbearably bland. She lived like a machine, going through tasks without spirit or surprise. Dull, unchanging, and without spark. She could never stir his desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he longed for was a partner who understood him, someone who could stand at his side through every storm. In his mind, only Lainey fit that role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny gathered up the contract and had it delivered to the court, ready to offer Eleanor a few courteous  words, but Lainey leaned close and gave his sleeve a small tug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonny, I was thinking... I really like that villa too,&#34;Lainey said.</p>
