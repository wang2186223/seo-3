                <p>With Stewart Group backing them and their own prestige already established, it was almost inevitable that investors would pour into Enigma Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely two days later, the company made headlines with a bold announcement-its grand launch would include exclusive counters opening in three major cities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When opening day arrived, Vladena practically overflowed with socialites and celebrities who had flown in from everywhere, joined by a handful of international stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was, after all, Enigma&#39;s stage to shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the elite in attendance, even catching the company&#39;s attention meant securing access to their coveted designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to be seen in an Enigma gown was a guarantee of success-spotlights would follow them without effort.Naturally, any star who could clear their schedule was present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to everyone&#39;s surprise, the mysterious Enigma was absent from the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town, in a private room of an upscale club in Vladena, Lillian scrolled lazily through the coverage on her tablet. Her playful eyes flicked up and landed on Eleanor, who sat sipping coffee as if none of it concerned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer with a grin, Lillian teased,&#34;Imagine if they found out the real Enigma was sitting right here.Do you think they&#39;d storm the club just to catch a glimpse of you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typical Lillian-always joking,always stirring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t bother with a reply. Instead, she plucked a slice of watermelon from the plate and neatly popped it into Lillian&#39;s talkative mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, her cheeks bulging with watermelon, let out a muffled laugh before dropping back onto the sofa. &#34;Eleanor, I heard ever since the Stewart Group invested, investors have been pulling out of Todd Group and pouring their money into Enigma Group instead. Even some of Todd&#39;s oldest shareholders jumped ship. Can you imagine Jonny&#39;s face when he found out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lifted her cup with calm fingers, blew gently across the surface, and answered without a flicker of emotion, &#34;Probably. He&#39;s always been far too arrogant for his own good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of response was exactly what Lillian had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t care about Todd Group anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of it made Lillian snicker, her eyes shining with mischief. &#34;It&#39;s hilarious, really. If Jonny ever realizes that you&#39;re Enigma, he&#39;ll lose his mind!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lose his mind was putting it lightly-he would tear himself apart with regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Todd Group was crumbling. Projects were stalled, cash flow was drying up, and their stock price was in free fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bankruptcy was circling closer every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Lillian, it was nothing less than poetic justice for the way he had tossed Eleanor aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor only tilted her lips into the faintest smile, offering no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met and they shared a quiet understanding. They raised their cups in a soft, unspoken toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few sips, Lillian suddenly set her glass down with a sharp clap, smacked her forehead, and bounced to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait a second, Eleanor-that&#39;s not fair at all! Starting a company sounds like the most fun in the world, and you didn&#39;t even invite me?&#34; She took a quick step closer, casped her hands together with exaggerated pleading, and blinked up at her.,tell me honestly-do I have any chance of becoming a shareholder in your company now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor arched a brow, clearly entertained by Lillian&#39;s dramatics.tiny company is suddenly worthy of your grand interest?&#34; Lillian flopped back into her seat, but this time her voice lost its playful lilt, carrying a thread of sincerity. &#34;Of course it is. My brother&#39;s the one running Brooks Group. I just live off allowances. I&#39;ve always dreamed of having something of my own... but, well-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business had never been her strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tried more than once to start something, but every effort ended in collapse, leaving her with nothing but the reputation of a carefree socialite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike her, Eleanor&#39;s career only seemed to climb higher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with Lillian speaking so openly, Eleanor saw no reason to push her away. A small smile touched her lips.&#34;Fine, fine. Consider it done.&#34;</p>
