                <p>After returning to the coastal resort, Erick gave Nolan a thorough report of everything he had uncovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan narrowed his eyes, fingers drumming an even beat on the sofa&#39;s armrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized he had nearly let Brodie slip from his memory, a snake who had always slithered in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t been long ago that someone tipped him off about Brodie&#39;s under-the-table dealings with Wray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he hadn&#39;t gotten the chance to deal with this troublesome pest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with old and fresh grudges piling up,he knew it was finally time to settle things once and for all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that decision,Nolan spoke to Erick in a voice as cold as steel. &#34;Freeze all of Colson&#39;s assets. And let our contacts in Zerovia know Brodie&#39;s time there is up,get him deported.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick instantly recognized that Nolan meant to strip Brodie of every resource, leaving him with nothing Without hesitation, Erick gave a respectful nod and hurried away, not risking another moment in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the bedroom door opened quietly with a soft click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped out, bare feet padding across the floor, draped in an oversized men&#39;s shirt and looking adorably drowsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked sleep from her eyes, hair charmingly rumpled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of her from the corner of his eye, Erick nearly jumped in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head quickly and made his exit, pulling the door shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise drew Nolan&#39;s attention, and he turned to see what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Eleanor appeared, Nolan&#39;s frosty demeanor faded, replaced by a gentle warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose to his feet and drew her near, still heavy with sleep,into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his head, Nolan let her stand right on top of his feet, his hands slipping around her waist to keep her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you finally wake up?&#34; he asked, his tone softer than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded, eyes half-closed, and burrowed against his chest,searching for a cozy spot to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms circled his neck, and in a voice rough from sleep, she mumbled, &#34;I&#39;m starving. Can we eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft chuckle escaped Nolan, his gaze brimming with tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He easily swept her off her feet and carried her straight to the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,an elegant lunch awaited them, already set out by the hotel staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they settled in to eat, Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed with a notification.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pickedit up and found a new message from Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen, it read, &#34;You won&#39;t believe this! Trudy was married off last night! To Oliver Wilson. He has eight ex-wives, and he&#39;s old enough to be her dad!Serves her right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced at the message, barely surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked over at NVolan,who was peeling shrimp for her with calm precision. There was no doubt in her mind that this kind of swift,ruthless solution could only have been Nolan&#39;s handiwork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but think Trudy had brought this fate upon herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Nolan&#39;s phone buzzed with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at it without much concern and saw a text from Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor leaned in, eyes scanning the screen. &#34;Have Eleanor come over for dinner this weekend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, her thoughts swirling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Visiting Norwood made her nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if his health took a turn for the worse because of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing her sudden unease, Nolan set his phone aside and gently pinched her cheek. &#34;What&#39;s got you so worried? The last time I was there, Grandpa made it clear he wouldn&#39;t meddle in our relationship anymore.That means he&#39;s accepted you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his voice, his lips brushing her ear as he teased, &#34;And don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re the famous Soul  Surgeon. Grandpa won&#39;t end up in the hospital,even with us around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, caught off guard by his playful words,then broke into laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she nodded her agreement to go</p>
