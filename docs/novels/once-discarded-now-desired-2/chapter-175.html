                <p>A chill settled in Fraser&#39;s eyes as he pieced together what had likely unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, oblivious to the real reason behind Fraser&#39;s silence, took it as a sign that his son had let Nolan&#39;s words get to him. He puffed up with indignation and jumped to Lainey&#39;s defense. &#34;Fraser, don&#39;t you dare start doubting your own sister just because of a strangér&#39;s wild claims! If you let outsiders plant suspicion in your heart, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t call me Dad at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scared at first, Lainey quickly played her part when she saw Jeff rallying behind her.&#34;|t′Salright,Dad.I understand. Fraser and I haven&#39;t spent much time together, so I can&#39;t blame him for being cautious. Please don&#39;t be angry with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s frustration only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Fraser a glare, as if scolding a child who had disappointed him.&#34;You see? Lainey&#39;s still thinking about you,even now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser looked from Jeff to Lainey, studying them both for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered only a noncommittal &#34;Hmm,&#34; and said nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to reason with his father was pointless; he was too deeply entrenched in Lainey&#39;s web of lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only undeniable proof would ever open his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to Lainey, Fraser had no interest in wasting another word on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced her little act had erased all suspicion, Lainey clung cheerfully to Jeff&#39;s arm, calling over her shoulder. &#34;Come on, Dad, Fraser. Eleanor&#39;s got Nolan in her corner now, so she won&#39;t admit that she is guilty. Let&#39;s go. Mom&#39;s waiting alone at the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sweet smile, she twisted the blame back onto Eleanor and tried to hurry them along, earning herself another long, thoughtful look from Fraser. He still said nothing, letting his silence speak for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for good reason, Nolan was grinning, completely unfazed by the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pressed him for an explanation, he replied, &#34;I&#39;m thrilled that you admitted that we&#39;re dating in front of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this really the time for you to get all sentimental?&#34; she grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t bothered at all. Drawing her close, he leaned in and murmured,&#34;Let me handle everything.Erick will dig up the truth, and Lainey won&#39;t get away with this. No one from the Benton family will trouble you again,I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced over, catching Nolan&#39;s profile in the half-light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension showed in the sharp set of his jaw, belying his calm tone; he was anything but unfazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mischievous glint sparked in her eyes. She leaned in, voice light and teasing, &#34;So you trust me that completely, NNolan? What if I were the mastermind, the one who put Millie up to it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Nolan met her gaze and replied, &#34;That&#39;s impossible. You&#39;re not capable of something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His conviction stunned her for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody had ever given her that kind of faith, unquestioning, absolute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd family had treated her like a servant, and everyone else saw her as nothing more than a scheming orphan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Nolan seemed able to see right through the masks she wore, past every rumor and every scar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warmth crept into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked away, settling deeper into the seat. For the first time all day, she let herself relax. The passing scenery caught her attention. Suddenly, she realized they were pulling up to the ornate iron gates of Nolan&#39;s estate in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had slipped away and quietly made his way back to his house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t decide whether to laugh or sigh at Nolan&#39;s constant scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan cut the engine, yet he lingered in the driver&#39;s seat instead of stepping out right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced her way and spoke in a low, steady voice, trying to defend himself. &#34;Look, you&#39;re exhausted, and if I took you back to your apartment, it&#39;d be a long drive. This way is easier. You need rest more than anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made it sound considerate, but the excuse was transparent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a look, rolling her eyes. &#34;Keep telling yourself that, NNolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she let it go. After the day she had had, fighting him on this felt pointless.</p>
