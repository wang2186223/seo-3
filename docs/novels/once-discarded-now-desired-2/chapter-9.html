                <p>Jonny&#39;s expression clouded over the moment Eleanor&#39;s words sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, are you absolutely sure about this?&#34; Sallie asked, her voice carrying a last trace of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am,&#34; Eleanor answered with quiet conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In that case, I won&#39;t try to stop you,&#34; Sallie said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew what a bad marriage meant to a woman. &#34;If this is your choice, dear, then you have my full support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate that, Sallie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to force yourself to stay for dinner tonight. With Jonny and Lainey here, the meal will taste bitter. I&#39;ll invite you back another day, just the two of us.&#34; Moved by Salie&#39;s kindness, Eleanor nodded. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll come another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising to her feet, she turned her back on Jonny without hesitation and left the Todd family&#39;s estate with her head held high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to cut every last tie with Jonny,Eleanor made up her mind to settle matters completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that day, she called Lillian and asked her to connect with a real estate agent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Lillian showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After inspecting the property, she asked with surprise, &#34;This place is in such a prime spot. Are you sure you really want to let it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keeping it feels like keeping bad luck. I&#39;d rather sell it and move on,&#34; Eleanor responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right about that. I&#39;ll handle everything, so you don&#39;t have to worry.&#34; Eleanor placed a steaming cup of coffee in front of her. &#34;I appreciate it, Lillian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t mention it. It&#39;s what we do for friends,&#34; Lillian said as she sank into the sofa. &#34;By the way, Mr. Gill is hosting an antique exhibition in two weeks. Want to come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hesitated, uncertain. &#34;I&#39;m not sure he&#39;d even want to see me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re overthinking.&#34; Lillian looped her arm around Eleanor&#39;s shoulders. &#34;You&#39;re his only apprentice. Of course he wants to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David Gill wasn&#39;t only a respected name in the antique collection industry. He was also the chosen heir of Mystic Glen&#39;s medical skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every successor of Mystic Glen took just one student in their lifetime. David had chosen Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor never failed David&#39;s expectations, mastering the refined craft of special tool therapy with extraordinary precision. To keep her identity hidden, she treated every patient behind a mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers spread among the public, and with no real name to use, they began to call her the Soul Surgeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her talent could have earned her recognition across the medical world, yet she chose to bury it and live as Jonny&#39;s dutiful wife for three long years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of David&#39;s defeated look before her marriage still haunted her, and guilt weighed heavily on her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian reached out to steady her. &#34;Stop blaming yourself. I&#39;ll be by your side when the time comes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two weeks slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The highly anticipated antique exhibition opened with grandeur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crowds filled the venue, including the wealthy elite who cared little for antiques but wanted to bask in the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the lounge reserved for honored guests,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor faltered briefly before lifting her hand to knock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound, the door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated by the window in his wheelchair, David faced away. In three years, his hair had grown strikingly silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s far too noisy outside. I&#39;ll step out when the intermission starts.&#34; Believing it was an attendant, he spoke without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a steadying breath, Eleanor whispered,&#34;Mr.Gill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man froze, then slowly turned. His eyes widened.&#34;Eleanor?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s me.&#34; Eleanor crossed the room toward him. &#34;I owe you an apology. After all your years of teaching, I abandoned your trust.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David gave a slow shake of his head. &#34;No need to apologize. This is your life, and you deserve to make your own choices.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here now. This time, I&#39;ll carry forward the medical legacy you entrusted to me-as the Soul Surgeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And will your husband stand behind such a decision?&#34;</p>
