                <p>Lainey had already suffered setbacks because of Nolan before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she wasn&#39;t coming empty-handed. She carried with her a contract worth a staggering sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deal she prepared between the Benton and the Stewart families looked balanced on the surface, with both sides splitting the responsibilities equally. But the profit share was another story. The Bentons would only get 30%, while the Stewarts would walk away with 70%. In essence, it was like handing the Stewart family free money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was convinced that no one, not even Nolan, could turn down such a lucrative offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the moment she arrived at the Stewart Group&#39;s front desk, she was stopped. &#34;Miss, do you have an appointment?&#34; the receptionist asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting her chin with pride, Lainey declared, &#34;I&#39;m from the Benton family. If you&#39;ve been keeping up with the news,you should recognize me. I&#39;m here to meet Nolan. Inform him immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receptionist&#39;s smile never wavered. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. Mr. Stewart doesn&#39;t have you on his schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s temper flared. &#34;How dare you dare block me? Do you even realize who I am? My name opens doors. Step aside. I&#39;m going up today whether you like it or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brimming with confidence, she strode straight toward the elevators, convinced the receptionist wouldn&#39;t dare stand in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, the receptionist, clearly experienced in handling all kinds of guests regardless of their status, stepped in and firmly repeated the rule. &#34;Apologies, but without an appointment, you won&#39;t be allowed upstairs, no exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s rage burned so hot she nearly raised her hand at the receptionist. Just then, her eyes caught sight of Eleanor walking in from outside. Dressed simply in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying nothing but a thermal lunchbox, she walked straight toward the elevator. No one stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s nails dug into her palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she barred while Eleanor strolled through like she owned the place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly rushed forward, stepping in front of Eleanor to block her way. &#34;Eleanor! Stop right there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor didn&#39;t even pause. She just gave a small smile and walked past without a word, as if Lainey wasn&#39;t worth the trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to lose face, Lainey straightened her back and hissed, &#34;Don&#39;t come to see Nolan again. He belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor arched a brow, amusement lacing her voice. &#34;Really? Funny, I must have missed the memo.How come his actual girlfriend wasn&#39;t informed about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to ignore Eleanor&#39;s sarcasm, Lainey pulled out a thick contract and waved it like a trophy. &#34;See this? A ten-billion-dollar deal. If I place it in front of him, do you think he&#39;ll refuse? Once our families join forces, marriage will be inevitable. I suggest you walk away now so you don&#39;t get tossed aside again and humiliated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could even reply, a cold, authoritative voice came from the elevator. &#34;The one who should leave is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had noticed Nolan stepping out of the elevator, but in a fewN long strides, he was at Eleanor&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t hesitate fora second, and took the lunch box right out of her hands. His voice held a hint of warmth as he asked, &#34;What made you drop by all of a sudden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor pouted. &#34;If I don&#39;t show up once in a while, you&#39;ll probably start complaining on Facebook about being neglected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, that was something Nolan might pull off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey saw him, she ignored everything else and rushed forward, presenting the contract with both hands. &#34;Nolan, look. This is the contract I secured for you. Our families can collaborate, and Stewart Group will get seventy percent. My condition is simple-just break up with Eleanor, and the deal is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if he needed her money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even bother responding. He simply gave her a look that made it clear he found her ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey paled, her voice trembling.&#34;NO,that&#39;s impossible. You can&#39;t give up a ten-billion-dollar deal for Eleanor. Tell me that&#39;s not true!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of dignifying her with a reply, he bent down and, in front of everyone, swept Eleanor into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey froze, her contract shaking in her hands as Nolan carried Eleanor straight toward the private elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was he thinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejecting Lainey was one matter, but holding her so openly in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan offered no explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when the doors closed did he answer her confusion with a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the first time Eleanor had come looking for him on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nolan, that was reason enough to show his appreciation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor suddenly understood why he would act like this.</p>
