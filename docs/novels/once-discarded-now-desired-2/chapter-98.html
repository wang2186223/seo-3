                <p>Within just half a day, Nolan&#39;s comments shot to the top of trending	topics,	tagged	with	#Nolan&#39;sDevotionToEnigma         and         #Nolan&#39;sSupportForEnigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the news,Eleanor felt a deep sense of warmth,finally understanding what it meant to be trusted completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, you&#39;ve seen this, haven&#39;t you?&#34; Lillian gripped her hand tightly,her voice edged with worry.&#34;Nolan has publicly backed you. If anything concerns you,speak up now. Public opinion can be brutal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian thought about the Stewart family&#39;s position and understood that unless their view changed, Norwood would refuse to accept Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Eleanor married Nolan, a truly peaceful life wasn&#39;t guaranteed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Eleanor remained composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s support stirred something within her,causing a brief hesitation, but it passed quickly. &#34;Think of it as a test for Nolan,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor knew that if Nolan couldn&#39;t weather this challenge, he wouldn&#39;t endure the unpredictable storms that lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted a partner who could walk beside her as an equal, not someone who needed endless shielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Eleanor&#39;s silence, Lainey grew bolder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She anonymously sent out several more tweets, one directly targeting the Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline screamed, &#34;Financial Chaos at the Hope House-Large Donations Allegedly Diverted to Enigma&#39;s Personal Account.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the bottom of the post, she had even attached what looked like bank statements, carefully forged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under normal circumstances, netizens might have questioned whether the images were real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at this critical moment, nobody paid it any attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone focused only on one thing: Enigma&#39;s reputation appeared completely destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The backlash online was unrelenting. Even Myah couldn&#39;t escape the storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surrounded by a swarm of reporters, she repeated herself over and over. &#34;No, Eleanor didn&#39;t take any money. Those funds were meant to help the children</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words, however, were quickly lost in the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly anyone believed her explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some even accused Myah of being complicit, claiming she deserved to be jailed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor heard the news, her usually steady eyes flickered with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah was the person who had granted her a second chance at life, a rare soul whose safety she would defend without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma&#39;s reputation could be sacrificed, but Myah could not be touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that resolve, she pulled out her phone, preparing to address the press herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to act, a call came through. &#34;Is this Miss Eleanor Warren? I&#39;m Leon Ortiz, curator of the Elepdon Museum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Eleanor raised an eyebrow, momentarily taken aback. &#34;Is there anything I can help you with?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other line, Leon exhaled, his voice tinged with regret. &#34;Miss Warren, we&#39;ve seen the false reports spreading online. We deeply regret that our oversight has caused you so much trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They refused to stand idly by while someone patriotic was dragged through the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s fingers tightened slightly around the phone.&#34;And?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Queen&#39;s diamond tiara was a donation you made to our museum without expecting any compensation.All taxes were waived under our agreement, so there&#39;s no question of evasion!&#34; Leon stated firmly. &#34;We want to set the record straight. We cannot allow an honorable person to be defamed. Will you let us handle this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused, a faint smile tugging at her lips before she said, &#34;Alright. I&#39;lllet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her decision was made for the sake of the Hope House and, above all, for Myah.</p>
