                <p>Emma had no inkling of the storm brewing outside her world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she got home, she locked herself in her bedroom, shutting out everyone and everything. She wouldn&#39;t even touch the food left on her tray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours slipped by, and darkness filled the corners of her mind. By sundown, though, her thoughts cleared and a new plan took shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It finally dawned on her, Lainey was just as trapped as she was. There was no way that woman would risk her own future with the Benton family just to cut her loose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking away from all that money and influence?Lainey.wasn&#39;t that foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization lifted a weight from her chest.Suddenly, the pieces clicked together. Maybe she could turn the situation to her advantage and squeeze some cash out of Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin tugged at her lips. Hope returned, and Emma slipped out the door with a renewed spring in her step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to spend the evening at a bar, sipping a few drinks and toasting to her own little victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was loaded, and taking a few million off her would be easier than most people thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hard times were about to become a thing of the past;she could almost taste the freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate, however, had different plans. Emma&#39;s car sputtered and died on the way to the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t keep driving, so she guided the car to a stop along the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh of pure irritation, she pulled to the side of the road and yanked open the door, ready to curse her luck. Before she could even take a breath, two rough hands clamped over her mouth from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thrashed wildly, kicking at the ground and swinging her elbows, but the attacker barely flinched. In seconds, he dragged her off into the shadows, hidden by thick underbrush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her muffled cries grew faint, then vanished completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miles away, a heavy silence filled a hospital room.Nolan sat at Eleanor&#39;s bedside, the weight of worry pressing into his brow as he watched her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his phone buzzed, cutting though the hush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He checked the screen. Erick&#39;s name flashed back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, we tracked down the driver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression hardened, and a chill settled in the air. &#34;Don&#39;t hold back. Get him to talk. I want the truth about who ordered that hit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way a nobody truck driver just happened to ram into a Rolls-Royce. Nolan was certain the crash was orchestrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on Eleanor&#39;s pale face, and something sharp twisted in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would never forgive himself if harm found her again, and he couldn&#39;t stand the thought of her being wronged another moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While those worries chased each other through his mind, the hallway outside suddenly erupted with shouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Out of my way! Who here thinks they can stop me?&#34;a thunderous voice demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandfather had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle in Nolan&#39;s jaw ticked with annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose from his seat, gently tucking the blanket around Eleanor&#39;s shoulders before slipping quietly from the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corridor, rows of bodyguards in dark suits stood like statues, each one radiating stern authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single soul was allowed past their line; security was so tight, it felt suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Near the elevator, Norwood was locked in a standoff with the guards, cane gripped tight in his wrinkled fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he spotted Nolan, he hurled the cane straight at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ungrateful brat! You&#39;d barricade your own grandfather just to protect a girl? Are you really so determined to turn Elepdon upside down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan let the cane strike his armn, refusing to so much as wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take my grandfather home,&#34; he said coldly,directing the servant who stood beside his grandfather. There wasn&#39;t a moment to spare for explanations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The less anyone knew about Eleanor&#39;s whereabouts,the safer she would be until the real culprit was found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, when he looked his grandfather in the eye,the edge in his voice softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, look after your health, Grandpa. When this is over, I&#39;ll come home and give you a proper apology.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s attitude lit a fire in Norwood, and his whole body trembled from how furious he had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to speak again, but Nolan had already turned his back and was giving one last command to the bodyguards standing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He faced the bodyguards and gave one last command, his voice cutting through the tension. &#34;No one comes through that door. Anyone who tries, deal with them, no exceptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Nolan strode to the elevator,his mind already moving on to the next threat.</p>
