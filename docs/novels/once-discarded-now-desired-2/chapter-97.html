                <p>Several days later, the atmosphere at Stewart family&#39;s residence was tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler&#39;s report barely finished when Norwood shot Nolan a look of pure fury, unable to hide his displeasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So this is the incredible woman you want as your wife?&#34;Norwood snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan squared his shoulders, refusing to back down as he locked eyes with Norwood. &#34;Grandpa, I believe in her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That calm response only fueled Norwood&#39;s outrage,causing him to break into a fit of coughing as his cheeks turned bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You believe in her? What good is your belief?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s hand shook as he pointed accusingly at Nolan. &#34;I won&#39;t accept a granddaughter-in-law with a stained reputation! You&#39;ve always gone your own way,but this time, you must do as I say. End it with her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan kept silent, his eyes flickering toward the butler  for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing the cue, the butler moved quickly, gently patting Norwood&#39;s back to help him catch his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Norwood had calmed down, Nolan returned his focus to him and spoke steadily. &#34;Grandpa, she&#39;s my girlfriend. I&#39;ll handle things the way I see fit. Your health comes first, so please take care of yourself.I&#39;ll visit again in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, he walked out of the house with purposeful steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why must you be so stubborn?&#34; Norwood&#39;s anger boiled over as he slammed his cane on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the Stewart family was doomed to have someone put love above family honor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson had done it once, and now Nolan was repeating the same mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood couldn&#39;t shake the fear that Nolan&#39;s downfall would eventually come at the hands of a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least he had guessed one thing correctly-Nolan always wore his heart on his sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he fell for someone, it meant unwavering faith  and loyalty, no matter the circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the driver&#39;s seat, Erick glanced at Nolan in the rearview mirror and spoke carefully. &#34;Mr. Stewart, was your grandfather upset with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan reclined against the plush seat, rubbing the bridge of his nose. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no interest in revisiting that sour conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind was on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet backlash was getting worse by the hour,and he wasn&#39;t sure she could manage the pressure on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get a PR team to take down the trending topic right away,&#34; he instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick paused, a troubled expression flashing briefly.&#34;Mr. Stewart, we can&#39;t make it disappear. The scandal is about taxes, and that&#39;s way out of our hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news even included the official auction page as proof, making any attempts to hide it completely useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Erick had tried to block the story the moment it broke, but the effort had been in vain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standard PR tricks were completely useless in a  situation like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news left Nolan quiet, his usually cool gaze clouded with thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed silent for a few seconds before giving a quiet order. &#34;Stop the car here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dozens of reporters were waiting just outside the Stewart family&#39;s residence, and the moment the car rolled to a halt, they surged forward in a frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, do you have any comment about Enigma&#39;s tax investigation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will your family block your engagement to Eleanor because of the scandal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you planning to end things with Eleanor over this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, can you give us your official response?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick began to get out, ready to clear a path through the crowd, but Nolan held up a hand to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Nolan got out and walked right into the sea of cameras and microphones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his expression remained stern, a gentle warmth crept into his eyes as he spoke. &#34;I believe in her.No matter what happens, my wife will only be her.&#34; Right then, the entire group of reporters instantly fell silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if they had heard Nolan say something similar in the past, the conviction in his voice this time left them speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was, after all, Nolan Stewart-the city&#39;s most striking and impossibly wealthy bachelor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor might have been a renowned designer,but with Nolan&#39;s power and fortune, he could have chosen anyone he wanted. Why was he so obsessed with her of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more they tried to make sense of it, the more impossible it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Nolan delivered one last message, his voice unwavering. &#34;Let me be clear: if anyone goes against her, they go against me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slid back into the car, leaving the press frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporters could already picture the chaos this story would unleash; the city&#39;s high-society women were bound to be devastated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, casual flings were common, but true,unwavering loyalty from a man like Nolan was a rare n..thing.</p>
