                <p>The sting faded into a cool rush, soothing the ache while leaving behind a strange tingling sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focused entirely on his task, Nolan bent his head with quiet concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light streamed across his face, carving shadows along the edges of his strong profile. Even his lashes flickered faintly with every movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so close, his features felt almost unreal-striking in a way that made Jonny seem forgettable,unfairly breathtaking, as though he had stepped out of a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting second, Eleanor lost herself, her heart skipping out of rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without breaking the rhythm of his hands, Nolan lifted his  gaze ever so slightly, catching the way she stared. Enjoying the view?&#34; His words rolled out low and smooth as he teased her in that calm voice of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to Eleanor&#39;s face, the sudden blush making her feel like she had just been caught misbehaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping herself back to the moment, she glanced around nervously, her cheeks still tinged with pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out quickly, snatching the cotton swab from his hand to change the subject. &#34;Mr. Stewart,this is nothing serious. I can take care of it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, a faint curve forming at the edge of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of arguing, he released his grip and let her handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare, however, didn&#39;t move away, holding a glimmer of intrigue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of his attention unsettled her. His presence alone carried a pressure that was hard to ignore Summoning her courage, she finally looked up and asked with uncertainty, &#34;Mr. Stewart, do you really have the time to stand here and watch me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the head of Stewart Group wasn&#39;t someone expected to linger over such a trivial matter.</p>
