                <p>At the corridor&#39;s far end, an attendant hurried toward Brodie, lowering his voice. &#34;Mr. Stewart, the individual has been escorted into Room 9,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s eyes narrowed with satisfaction as he retrieved a thick stack of cash from his pocket, passing it over. &#34;Excellent.Mind your words. Don&#39;t let anything slip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attendant nodded vigorously, securing the money, then retreated silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie observed the departing figure, a smug curl forming on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He convinced himself that once he slept with Eleanor, the Benton family would have no choice but to marry her off to him, all in the name of reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that point, he would officially become the Benton family&#39;s son-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt certain that with their influence behind him, the Stewart Group would eventually fall under his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s steps lightened, a cheerful hum escaping him as he moved toward Room 9.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distracted, he rounded the corner and collided with the door&#39;s number plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;6&#34; flipped over, revealing a &#34;9.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing his throbbing forehead, he paused, briefly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it. The number clearly read 9, no errors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grin stretched across his face, and without hesitation, he nudged the door open quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness swallowed the room, the curtains drawn tightly shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the corridor&#39;s dim glow, he could barely make out the shape of a woman lying on the bed. Brodie&#39;s breathing hitched instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled out his phone, opening Nolan&#39;s contact, and typed a bold message. &#34;Nolan, the role of the Benton family&#39;s son-in-law belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sending it, he tucked the device away with smug satisfaction and secured the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step by step, he approached the bed, determination etched on his face. &#34;Baby, just surrender yourself to me.I&#39;ll take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not realizing it, he had been mistaken about the person from the very beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Nolan returned to the villa in Regal Heights after an exhausting day at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed sharply in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled it out casually, thinking it could be a message from Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, the screen flashed Brodie&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion narrowed Nolan&#39;s eyes as he read the text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton family&#39;s son-in-law?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Brodie scheming now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease immediately surged through Nolan. He quickly dialed Erick and demanded, &#34;Where is Eleanor tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick froze at Nolan&#39;s icy tone, momentarily speechless. Still, he answered without hesitation, &#34;She attended the Elepdon Museum appreciation banquet tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan ended the call abruptly, pivoting sharply as he stormed out of the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick, gripping the disconnected phone, stood frozen,perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sounded like a man ready to strike. Could Eleanor have been harmed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nolan arrived, the banquet was drawing to a close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests dispersed in small clusters, fatigue etched across their faces from hours of mingling.Nolan immediately recognized the familiar figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped gracefully out of the entrance, the pale lavender dress highlighting her poised, elegant form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s tense heart, which had been hammering the entire way, finally eased at the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Brodie&#39;s message arrived, his mind had conjured every terrible possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his way, he had run countless red lights, driven by a single thought-he could not allow any harm to reach Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully,she was perfectly safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan closed the distance with long, purposeful strides and, seeing her bewildered expression, pulled her tightly into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His embrace radiated warmth and strength, a silent promise that he would never release her.</p>
