                <p>Before heading to the Benton family&#39;s residence, Nolan made sure the car was loaded with gifts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he rolled into the driveway, he spotted Jeff jogging back from his morning run. The man slowed, scowl already in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well, look who it is,&#34; Jeff drawled, voice thick with sarcasm. &#34;Mr. Stewart graces us with his presence.Shame I didn&#39;t prepare a red carpet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t flinch. He stepped out carefully, carrying the gifts, his voice even and polite.&#34;Mr.Benton,I&#39;ve come to see Eleanor. Is she home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made Jeff&#39;s anger spike. This was the man who had left his daughter miserable for days, and now he had the nerve to show up and ask for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,you still remember my daughter?&#34; Jeff sneered. &#34;I thought you were far too occupied with your close _&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the jab could land, Hilda appeared at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot her husband a sharp glance, and his words died in his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda turned to Nolan, her tone calm, almost regal. &#34;Go ahead upstairs. Eleanor&#39;s in her room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew her daughter&#39;s heart better than anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes, the best way to support her was to step back and let her navigate her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan nodded in gratitude, set the gifts aside, and hurried up the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Eleanor was hunched over her sketchpad, absorbed in her designs. The moment she saw him, her hand froze mid-stroke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wha are you doing here?&#34; she asked. The second those words left her mouth, he pulled her into a warm hug, burying his face in thecrook of her neck.His voice was rough. &#34;Baby, I&#39;m sorry. I haven&#39;t been there for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stiffened for a fraction of a second, then gently pulled back, creating the space she needed. &#34;I&#39;m not angry&#34; she replied softly. &#34;I&#39;ve just been swamped. There&#39;s a shipment of artifacts arriving soon. Dyer and I are buried in research and auction preparations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught the indifferent look in her eyes and felt that familiar sting of helplessness. &#34;How about I attend the auction with you?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked at him, her eyes calm and distant. &#34;Elora isn&#39;t doing well. You should be there with her more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was tired of hope constantly turning into disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him,showing up or not might have been just a matter of words, but for her, it was a repeated letdown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence, or absence, no longer shifted her world as it once had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard her words, panic prickled in Nolan&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped her hand, a little tighter than necessary. &#34;Baby, I promise. This time, I&#39;ll be there. I won&#39;t let you down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered only a soft hum in acknowledgment and withdrew her hand with calm deliberation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stared at his empty hand, the creeping fear of losing her grasped him like a vise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He floundered for an excuse, a lifeline. &#34;How about lunch? I&#39;ll take you to your favorite restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, replying, &#34;I can&#39;t. I have to meet Dyer this afternoon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The finality in her voice left no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s shoulders tensed. He knew her stubborn streak all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing would only deepen her annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, he made his way toward the door, casting glances back at her every few steps. Just as he reached the doorway, a thought struck him. He stopped abruptly.&#34;Oh,, Eleanor, Grandpa&#39;s in the hospital. He&#39;s been asking about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he left, carrying a mix of regret and restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s hand, holding the pen, paused slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s health was delicate, and he couldn&#39;t take much more strain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to visit him.</p>
