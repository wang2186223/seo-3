                <p>The second Wray got out of the house, he noticed the butler engaged in a tense confrontation with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector Perez, long a loyal adviser to Norwood, rarely allowed anyone to provoke him into open conflict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intrigued, Wray crouched behind a fountain, listening closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young man whose features seemed vaguely familiar pleaded earnestly, &#34;I heard Grandpa is unwell, so l brought some premium health supplements from abroad to visit him. Please, let me in. I promise to leave immediately after seeing him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s lined face remained unreadable, showing no hint of concession. &#34;Mr. Stewart, have you forgotten what your grandfather insisted seventeen years ago?Leave at once. Regarding those supplements, this country already has more than enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s hand froze midair, clutching the box, his face alternating between pale and flushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a descendant of the Stewart family, he was denied entry by a mere butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Humiliation flooded his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He vowed silently that once he controlled the family and claimed its leadership, Hector would no longer hold his post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oblivious to Brodie&#39;s thoughts, Hector gave a slight bow and gestured for him to depart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no alternatives, Brodie followed toward the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Hector turned, he caught sight of Wray nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered Wray a strained smile. &#34;Congratulations,Mr. Stewart, on securing the CEO position at the Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie narrowed his eyes,resentment simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could such a distant relative assume the CEO position?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood had clearly lost his senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, an opportunity glimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could not approach Norwood or enter the company directly, perhaps he could utilize Wray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acknowledging Hector, Wray kept his gaze fixed on Brodie. It did not take long to identify Brodie as Colson&#39;s illegitimate son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The enemy of Nolan&#39;s enemy could become an ally,and Wray considered the possibility of collaboration</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector remained unaware that a single glance had already begun syncing their intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector guided Brodie out, ensuring he entered his own car before departing for the company to follow Norwood&#39;s orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet inside the car, Brodie did not drive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he lowered the window as Wray stepped out from the estate gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wray, how does it feel to take orders from others?&#34;Brodie taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now wielding authority, Wray refused to yield. A sardonic smile curved his lips. &#34;No matter how unpleasant, I&#39;m far ahead of some people. Who exactly was turned away at the gates?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie chuckled rather than fuming, climbed out of the car, and reached forward with his hand. &#34;I understand you&#39;ve been named CEO of the Stewart Group.Congratulations. But do those senior fools at the company actually respect you?&#34; Wray&#39;s face shifted slightly as he shook Brodie&#39;s hand perfunctorily. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie withdrew his hand, leaning casually against the car, cigarette dangling loosely. &#34;You know perfectly well. I hold the inheritance rights; you control the real power. Let&#39;s join forces and take over the entire Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray paused, considering the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s words had struck deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed someone with legal inheritance to secure his position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet everyone knew Norwood despised Brodie, the illegitimate child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Norwood discovered any alliance,his authority could vanish instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, with Nolan in mind, he was unwilling to let this chance escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized Norwood continued to care for Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That suggested that, someday, on a whim, the CEO role could return to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than entrusting his destiny to others, he decided to claim it himself. Keeping that in mind, Wray lifted his gaze and offered his hand toward Brodie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once their hands met, silence fell between them;their intentions were clear, requiring no words to explain.</p>
