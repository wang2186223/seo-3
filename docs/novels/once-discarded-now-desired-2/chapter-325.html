                <p>Eleanor disliked gatherings of that sort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a quick excuse before telling Besty, &#34;I&#39;m stepping outside for some air. Take care of things inside. Ring me if anything urgent happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward,she unpinned the badge from her chest and pressed it into Besty&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bold letters spelled Eleanor&#39;s full name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty hardly reacted with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the years,covering Eleanor&#39;s social obligations had become routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered right away,&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor&#39;s figure vanished beyond the doorway, Besty exhaled slowly, dabbing the sweat from her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden wave of dizziness left her unsettled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed the drink she had swallowed too quickly was finally taking effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head shook faintly as she considered finding a chair and resting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could move, sharp snapping fingers rang beside her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled; she turned and found Ryland standing there with a playful grin stretched across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed equally surprised to spot her. With hands buried in his pockets, he teased, &#34;Besty, imagine meeting you here! Or did you plan this encounter on purpose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty nearly rolled her eyes at his mocking tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared arrogant as well as unbearably conceited. She ignored Ryland altogether and tried walking past, irritation clear in her stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her steps grew uneven, her balance faltered, and a strange redness spread across her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still joking, Ryland went on, &#34;I know I&#39;m irresistible, so people often chase me. But Besty, that trick feels outdated.Perhaps-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buzzing filled her ears while her head clouded more heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to endure further, she cut him off through clenched teeth. &#34;Are you finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Ryland sense something unusual about Besty:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward quickly, catching her staggering form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her skin burned like firebeneath his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grin vanished instantly, replaced by a serious frown. &#34;Are you good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty&#39;s breathing came harsh and ragged, her body trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone with no trusted faces nearby, she doubted she could manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned, she turned to Ryland for support. &#34;I need to lie down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her distress, he decided at once. &#34;I&#39;ll take you upstairs to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her weak nod gave consent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, an attendant upstairs shifted nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments earlier, he had been given a generous tip with instructions to wait for a woman wearing Eleanor&#39;s badge and escort her to Room 9.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the elevator doors slid open, he noticed a man helping a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too anxious to raise his head, he only checked the badge pinned to her chest-it clearly bore Eleanor&#39;s name. Convinced she was the guest, he rushed to lead them toward Room 9.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, as Ryland lowered Besty onto the sofa, an odd fragrance lingered heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at her quickly and realized herstate was deteriorating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clawing at her collar, she gasped, overwhelmed by the heat. &#34;It&#39;s unbearable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland grew tense and resolved to summon a doctor without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he grabbed his phone, Besty, consumed by the fire racing through her, hurled herself at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched his collar and drove him backward with unexpected strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden force stunned him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the strange scent thickened, his own mind began slipping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their lips met, and both of them were consumed, carried helplessly into the moment.</p>
