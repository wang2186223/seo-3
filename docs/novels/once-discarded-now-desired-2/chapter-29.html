                <p>Word of the Stewart Group pulling their investment from the Todd Group didn&#39;t reach Eleanor until days later, when Lillian&#39;s text appeared on her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scanning the message, Eleanor arched a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Stewart Group&#39;s money, the Todd Group would be strapped for cash, and that meant the orphanage would no longer be under threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Nolan have had a hand in this? Always meddling, always forcing her to feel indebted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated the idea of owing him anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Control was something she preferred to keep in her own hands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined, she scrolled through her contacts until her finger hovered over a number she hadn&#39;t called in  years. This time, she hit dial. The line connected in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, a choked voice burst out with emotion. &#34;Boss! You&#39;re finally reaching out! It&#39;s been three years-I thought you&#39;d left us behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice belonged to someone she knew all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched her lips, but her words were clipped and direct. &#34;I need you to secure a piece of land in Elepdon. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s remote, as long as it&#39;s quiet and nowhere near the Usepsall project. Then set up a company in Vladena under the trademark Enigma. The paperwork will list you as the legal representative. My name must stay completely off the records.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One instruction after another spilled from her lips,and the person on the line was so overwhelmed with excitement that their voice shook. &#34;Boss, are you back in the game? That&#39;s incredible! For three years I&#39;ve been forced to sell your designs to other firms, and every time it felt like betrayal. Now we can finally rise again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she ended the call, Eleanor let out a quiet breath of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing land meant she could shield the orphanage from future threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, Nolan&#39;s interference had bought her time,but she knew Lainey wouldn&#39;t stop scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the land was in her hands, the orphanage could be moved whenever needed, safe from the shadow of the Usepsall project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The funding for construction would flow directly from Enigma,giving the children a stable future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better stil, all traces of the plan would lead back to her apprentice, keeping her own name safely hidden.It was the perfect move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to that, Lainey&#39;s shallow games looked like the tantrums of a child. Only a fool like Jonny would put Lainey on a pedestal and call her priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as if her thoughts had conjured him,her phone lit up with his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t Jonny just leave her alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an annoyed swipe, Eleanor accepted the call.&#34;Spit it out. What are you bothering me for this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her voice sent a thrill racing through Jonny.To him, it was proof that she still couldn&#39;t resist him.No matter how coldly she tried to cut him off,one call from him and she came running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That smugness bled into his words. &#34;Eleanor,Lainey&#39;s already living with me now, so stop dreaming about being my wife. But if you swallow your pride and come back, I&#39;ll still take you in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was because Lainey was too simple-minded, but ever since she moved in, the house felt like a circus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, raised in an orphanage, had been better at managing the homne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was easygoing, though. She wouldn&#39;t make a fuss about sharing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of juggling two women at once thrilled Jonny, and his voice grew more animated. &#34;I can tell you still want me. If you play nice, I might even think about giving you a child. Doesn&#39;t that sound good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nearly gagged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was wrong with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Lainey&#39;s nonsense rubbed off on him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were so vile they made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to speak, but Jonny beat her to it. &#34;Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Meet me there,and we&#39;ll straighten things out. If you show up, I&#39;lI even pretend your little affair never happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Eleanor with another man made his blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have been his ex-wife, but in his mind,she still belonged to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word dripped with entitlement, and Eleanor caught the hidden meaning instantly. Her thumb hovered over the hang-up button, but instead of ending the call, she shifted course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,&#34; she replied flatly, and without giving him the chance to reply, she disconnected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jonny wanted to make her sick, she would gladly return the favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amused by the idea, she fired off a quick message to her apprentice. &#34;Lumina Hotel. Room 888. Give my ex-husband a surprise he won&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a twisted way, it was almost an act of kindness.At least, Jonny would have his physical needs  satisfied.</p>
