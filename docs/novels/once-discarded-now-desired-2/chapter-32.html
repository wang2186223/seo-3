                <p>Jonny didn&#39;t see his problem as serious, but the irritation it caused was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had waited for days, expecting Eleanor to eventually cave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given their past, he was even prepared to let everything slide if she simply returned to the Todd household and resumed her role there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter how much time passed, she stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message was sent, and once again the only reply was that mocking little exclamation mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury burned hot enough that he nearly hurled his phone across the room, when suddenly the ringtone shattered the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope surged instantly. He convinced himself Eleanor had finally come around, that she was ready to apologize and plead with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching up the phone, he answered without hesitation. &#34;Eleanor? Finally realized your mistake?Well, it&#39;s too late for regrets now. I&#39;m warning you-be ready for me tonight. Wash up and wait, or you can forget about me forgiving you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause lingered on the line, heavy with hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Allard&#39;s guarded voice broke through. &#34;Mr.Todd, it&#39;s me. Mr. Rayne and the other shareholders... they&#39;re all talking about pulling out their investments. What should we do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny shot up from the sofa, rage flaring like fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those decrepit cowards!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They actually had the nerve to bring up withdrawing now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would love to see how they thought they would survive without the Todd Group backing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company was already listed, the road ahead nothing but clear skies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they were foolish enough to walk away, they would only be throwing away effortless pofits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless they had all gone mad, they would be crawling back before long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny snatched a jacket with a storm cloud hanging over his face and made straight for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he yanked it open, he nearly collided with Lainey, who stepped out from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonny, I made this soup for you. I&#39;ve been working on it all afternoon. Will you please taste it?&#34; Her hands trembled slightly as she offered the bowl, her eyes searching his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at her only deepened his irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for her, would the company be staring down this disaster? Since moving in, she had been more of a nuisance than anything-poking into his schedule, meddling where she didn&#39;t belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was long past tired of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started to push past her, but then he caught the shimmer of tears forming in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, he faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been the woman he once swore he loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he could humor her,just this once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clear reluctance, Jonny reached out and accepted the bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat seeped into his palms, and the fragrance rising from it was at least tolerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blew across the surface, then forced down a cautious sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taste hit him like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greasy and flat-there wasn&#39;t a hint of seasoning, not even the faintest flavor to mask the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though Lainey had dumped unwashed ingredients straight into boiling water and called it soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Eleanor&#39;s soups-rich, fragrant, and layered with care-only made this concoction seem even more pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drained of patience, Jonny let his frustration spill out. &#34;From now on, leave the cooking to the servants.You&#39;ve already stirred up enough trouble. The shareholders are restless because of you, and I&#39;ve got bigger things to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, he brushed past her and stepped out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had his words to her cut this deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes blurred with tears as she turned toward Vickie in the living room. Her voice cracked as she sobbed, &#34;Vickie, it&#39;s my fault... I shouldn&#39;t even be here.Maybe I should just leave.&#34; Her shoulders trembled, her whole figure carrying the weight of grievance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie, caught off guard by Jonny&#39;s sudden cruelty,sat frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t reconcile this coldness with her son who had once doted on Lainey. Could it be...he had already set his sights on someone new?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Vickie could sort out her thoughts, Emma shot up from the sofa in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma said, &#34;Lainey, you can&#39;t leave! If you walk away now, that shameless Eleanor will swoop right back in to steal Jonny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Vickie, she said, &#34;Mom, say something-make her stay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Eleanor&#39;s name was spoken, Vickie&#39;s hesitation vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Eleanor was a stain that clung no matter how hard she tried to wash it away. Compared to that nuisance, Lainey seemed far more acceptable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie hurried forward and clasped Lainey&#39;s hand.Her voice softened as she muttered,&#34;DDon&#39;t let Jonny&#39;s temper scare you. He&#39;s just stressed from work, that&#39;s all. He doesn&#39;t mean to be cruel. You&#39;ve got me on your side, so stay here and be at ease.Once the company calms down, you and Jonny can finaly marry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of satisfaction flashed across Lainey&#39;s eyes,though she quickly masked it beneath a meek expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her head and leaned against Vickie with a practiced gentleness. &#34;Vickie, you&#39;re too good to me. When I marry into this family, I&#39;Il devote myself to treating you with respect and care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew well enough how men were-always chasing the new while neglecting the old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with Vickie in her corner, she had nothing to fear.The title of Jonny&#39;s wife was already within her grasp.</p>
