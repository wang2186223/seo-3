                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes widened in shock, her hands hidden behind her back curling into tight fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing.How could this happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pollen she had sprinkled on Hilda&#39;s pillow wasn&#39;t ordinary. It had cost her a fortune from the Underground Network. It was supposed to be undetectable, without color or smell, and deadly enough to trigger an asthma attack that would end Hilda quietly in her sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here she was, saved by a single pill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey couldn&#39;t believe it. And apparently, neither could the doctor, who had just finished checking on Hilda.He muttered in awe, &#34;This... this is a miracle!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting another second, he hurried out of the room, clearly eager to record the incident in detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something like this had to go straight intothe medical records immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the doctor was gone, Fraser got up and pulled Lainey out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes bored into her, filled with a hostility that made her skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart pounded as she scrambled for words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fraser, I think I know what happened! When I came in earlier, I saw Mom&#39;s medicine still sitting on the table.Maybe the nurse forgot to give it to her, so that&#39;s why-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Fraser cut her off, his tone final. &#34;I&#39;ll have it checked. For your sake, it had better be the way you claim or...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need to finish the sentence; the warning in his voice said it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart thudded painfully, but she forced herself to stay composed. &#34;Fraser, whether you trust me or not, the doctor will clear this up. I swear I didn&#39;t do anything. I wNas about to hit the nurse button myself.&#34; She clung to her story because she knew as long as she never admitted anything, there was no proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only used a little bit of pollen, so there was no way Fraser could ever trace it back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser narrowed his eyes, staring at her for what felt like an eternity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been wrong about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really just an unfortunate coincidence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, who would be bold enough to try something like murder?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, he wasn&#39;t about to take chances. From now on, Lainey would not be left alone with his mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go home,&#34; he ordered flatly. &#34;I&#39;ll stay with Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Lainey, though she forced a reluctant look, as if she hated leaving. She cast one last glance at Hilda through the doorway and said softly,&#34;Alright. Please take good care of Mom. If you get tired,let me know and I&#39;ll come back to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting the part of the caring daughter, she stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser, however, wasn&#39;t fooled. His suspicion might have eased for the moment, but deep down he knew Lainey wasn&#39;t truly his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doubted his sister would wear masks so easily or act with such calculated sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, on the other hand, could feel his gaze shadowing her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the elevator with shaky steps, her mind in a haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser must have started doubting her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might cover up this mess, but what about the one before?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he dug ,up the truth and linked it back to that waitress...there would be no way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey forced herself to toughen up, but once she sat inside her car,her nerves settled. No, killing again would only be a last resort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, mistakes could sometimes be turned into chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fresh thoughts spinning into a plan, she drove off from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She roamed the streets aimlessly for a bit before finally steering toward the Verdant Crest dorms,looking for that waitress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Millie Ruiz was in a frenzy, shoving a few worn clothes into an old suitcase. She was preparing to disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lainey appeared at the door, Millie froze in terror. The bundle of clothes slipped from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey,&#34; she stuttered, her voice trembling with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t speak and only stared at her in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, she stepped closer. From her bag, she pulled out her phone, scrolled to her photo album, and held the screen up for Millie to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image showed Millie&#39;s elderly parents and her little brother, stil in elementary school, all of them smiling innocently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s face drained of color instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Planning to run?&#34; Lainey&#39;s voice sounded calm, but every word carried a poisonous edge. &#34;That&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slid her phone back into her bag as if she had all the time in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But before you disappear, you&#39;Il handle one last thing for me.&#34; Lainey locked her eyes on Millie and spoke each word slowly. &#34;If not, do you really think you and your family will get away unharmed, even with the money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s knees buckled, and she fell helplessly to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey then leaned closer with a chilling smile, whispering her plan into her ear.</p>
