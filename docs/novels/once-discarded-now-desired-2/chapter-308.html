                <p>When Eleanor received Erick&#39;s message, she was already standing at the door of the Benton family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at her phone briefly, her face unreadable, then slipped it back into her bag and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room glowed with warm light. Hilda and Jeff sat together on the sofa, clearly waiting for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, Mom, why aren&#39;t you resting yet?&#34; Eleanor asked in mild surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda rose at once, taking Eleanor&#39;s bag with gentle hands and hanging it aside. &#34;We couldn&#39;t sleep until you came home. How was your day? Did you enjoy yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had planned everything so carefully that even Hilda had no idea about the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only thought Eleanor had been out with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to worry them, Eleanor forced a small smnile. &#34;Yes, it was nice. I&#39;m just tired. I&#39;d like to rest upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Jeff heard the word &#34;tired,&#34; he sprang to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone help Eleanor to her room.&#34; He ordered the servants quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, too drained to argue, simply nodded and went upstairs on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant she was gone, Hilda&#39;s smile slipped away. Concern filled her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Eleanor&#39;s mother-how could she not tell her daughter was upset?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who had hurt her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda sat lost in thought, but Jeff missed the signs completely. With a yawn, he slung an arm around her shoulder. &#34;Honey, Eleanor&#39;s gone to bed. Let&#39;s go rest too.&#34; Hilda shoved him off, her eyes flashing. &#34;Do you not care about our daughter at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff straightened instantly, wide awake. &#34;That&#39;s not fair! Of course I care. But she looked fine to me.You&#39;re overthinking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda glared at him, too angry to reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to message Denny to investigate when her phone buzzed with a new message from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a news link.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, she tapped it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline made her blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breaking News! Stewart Group CEO Nolan Abandons Fiancée Mid-Proposal! Eleanor Humiliated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s hands trembled as she scrolled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A photo filled the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stood alone among roses and candlelight, her expression dazed and wounded-like a child suddenly left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight cut into Hilda&#39;s heart like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was why Eleanor was upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan,that brat!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t he swear he would cherish her, protect her for life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this-this was what he did? Hilda&#39;s fury burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, standing beside her, saw the headline too. His face darkened in rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he grabbed his phone and barked into it. &#34;Denny! Take this news down. Not another second online!&#34; No one was allowed to mock Eleanor-his brilliant, graceful daughter-as someone abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, it was Nolan who should be seen as the one left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Denny replied immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Hilda rose early to prepare an elaborate breakfast with all of Eleanor&#39;s favorite dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Jeff kept sneaking worried glances at their daughter, piling her plate with food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat more of this, sweetheart,&#34; Hilda urged softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this too,&#34; Jeff added, dropping another dish onto her plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked at the overflowing mound, then at their overly eager faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood at once-they had found out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She herself had seen the news last night. But before long, every trace of it vanished online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Jeff must have stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her utensils down, she met their anxious eyes and spoke first. &#34;Nolan got a call during the proposal.His friend attempted suicide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She deliberately left out Elora&#39;s namne, not wanting them to worry further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeff didn&#39;t care who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that mattered to him was that his daughter had been wronged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda quickly nudged him.under the table to stop his temper, then reached across to clasp Eleanor&#39;s cool hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady but warm.&#34;We don&#39;t know what&#39;s been happening between you and Nolan. But listen to me-no matter what, your father and I will always stand behind you. As long as we&#39;re here, no one will hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s nose stung at her mother&#39;s words. Tears welled in her eyes. Family,love,care-things she never dared dream of in the last twenty years were now hers for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed Hilda&#39;s hand, her voice choked but steady. &#34;Mom,I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After breakfast, she returned to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, she stared at her phone. Finally, she opened her chat with Nolan, fingers hovering over the keyboard. At last, she typed, &#34;Are you done yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds turned into minutes. Minutes dragged into an hour. The chat remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her message went unanswered.</p>
