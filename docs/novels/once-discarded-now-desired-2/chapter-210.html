                <p>Horace&#39;s eyes were bloodshot, burning with fury as he grabbed the doctor by the collar, looking like he might crush him on the spot. &#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor froze, words choking in his throat, every breath trembling. Fear had him paralyzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s temper snapped further, and he kicked the nearby medical kit across the room with a deafening crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, pointing at the group of trembling lackeys at the door, he barked, &#34;Go! Find a doctor! If my wife dies today, you&#39;ll all wish you hadn&#39;t been born!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men bolted, scrambling out in a panic, leaving the room heavy with Horace&#39;s ragged breathing and the sharp tension in his gaze as he stared at his wife on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t love her, but he respected her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her, he could never have climbed to the top of the Fist Guild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of handling it all alone now was  unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, one of his men tentatively poked his head inside. After a shaky breath, he spoke. &#34;Boss, the woman from your private lounge... she says she can save Mrs. Boyd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trust a fragile-looking girl with his wife&#39;s life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he watched his wife&#39;s breaths grow shallow,desperation won over disbelief. He gritted his teeth and growled, &#34;Bring her in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was a trick or not, he had no choice but to gamble on a miracle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Eleanor was ushered into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took one look at the dying woman and instantly understood-this was Horace&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s gaze didn&#39;t waver from Eleanor, filled not with desire but with raw,tense intensity.&#34;Can you really do it?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor said nothing and strode directly to the bedside.  She then raised her eyes to meet his, unwavering.&#34;Step aside,&#34; she said firmly. &#34;If you&#39;re in the way, I can&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace froze for a second, then reluctantly stepped back,muttering under his breath but obeying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lifted three fingers and pressed them lightly on the woman&#39;s wrist. Her eyes closed as she focused,reading the pulse with practiced precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she opened them again, her expression filled with cetainty. &#34;She doesn&#39;t have an infectious disease. Her lungs have a blood clot blocking airflow, which is why she&#39;s struggling to breathe. The fever is just a complication from the lung issue.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes scanned the medical kit on the floor and landed on a sealed pack of needles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tore it open and grabbed one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With quick, exact movements, she drove the needle into the woman&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, the unconscious woman on the bed twitched violently, and a mouthful of dark red blood spilled from her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s eyes flared with rage. &#34;What did you do to her?&#34; He yanked the dagger from his waist and lunged forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But everything froze the instant his wife&#39;s eyes opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You reckless idiot, chasing after women again?&#34; she chided, her voice weak but unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace halted in shock, staring at his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she was still fragile, her face showed signs of life returning, and tears welled in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake, finally! I thought I&#39;d lost you! You had me terrified!&#34; he cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ruthless Zerovian mob boss she had known, the man feared by everyone, was now reduced to a fumbling,tearful husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even his men bowed their heads, not daring to make a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s mind raced. If this woman really held that kind of power over him, it would be easy to get out of there.</p>
