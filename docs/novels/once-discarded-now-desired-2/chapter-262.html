                <p>Norwood&#39;s expression turned thunderous instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Hector had already informed him of Brodie&#39;s return, he never anticipated such brazen audacity in appearing before him today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the glass beside him, he hurled it at Brodie with violent force. &#34;Who gave you permission to return to this country? Get back to Zerovia immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie sidestepped with casual ease, the glass exploding against the wall in a shower of fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, spreading his hands in mock innocence.&#34;Grandpa, I&#39;m simplyworried about your wellbeing.Dad learned you&#39;ve been unwell,so he dispatched me to check on your condition. His concern for you runs deep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concern for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More likely hoping for his swift demise!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This realization prompted Norwood to gesture furiously toward the exit, his voice quaking with rage. &#34;I told you to leave! I acknowledge no such son, nor do I recognize a grandsonlike you! Get out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than departing, Brode strolled directly inside and settled onto the sofa, crossing his legs with deliberate insolence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked his tongue disapprovingly and continued,&#34;Come on, Grandpa. Dad and I have consistently maintained exemplary behavior. How precisely have we offended you? It&#39;s Nolan&#39;s conduct today that warrants exile abroad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood felt his fury reaching a breaking point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t fathom how Brodie,nothing more than an illegitimate offspring,possessed the audacity to tell him what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of his reckless tendencies, Nolan remained the heir he had personally cultivated, the legitimate heir of Stewart Group. Nolan was way out of this bastard son&#39;s league.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to waste additional words, Norwood commanded coldly toward the entrance, &#34;Throw him out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately following his declaration, two security personnel entered,seizing Brodie from both sides and hauling him toward the exit. Brodie had intended merely to create disturbance and harbored no plans for extended presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though privately fuming, he offered no resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost the moment Brodie was forcibly ejected,Hector rushed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached Norwood swiftly, lowering his head in respectful submission. &#34;Mr. Stewart, Mr. and Mrs.Benton have arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Norwood could process this information, Jeff and Hilda burst through the entrance, their faces etched with obvious distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had finally found happiness. How could they permit anyone to destroy it? Not even Norwood possessed that authority!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood anticipated their purpose but spoke first with a frigid smile. &#34;Jeff, I&#39;m delighted you found your daughter,though you should consider teaching her appropriate conduct and decorum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he suggesting their daughter was shameless,desperately clinging to Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Nolan had been the one to propose first!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s chest heaved with righteous indignation as she  prepared to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff restrained her gently, patting her hand in a calming gesture that urged patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then fixed Norwood with an unwavering stare that contained no trace of submissive respect, only the frank assessment of an equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His declaration rang with absolute conviction, &#34;My daughter requires no criticism from outsiders. Should your family reject this union, that&#39;s perfectly acceptable. I&#39;ve already allocated sixty percent of Benton Group&#39;s shares plus our complete international operations as her wedding gifts. The world contains countless worthy men. We have no need for Nolan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following this pronouncement,Jeff refused Norwood even a parting glance, turning to depart with Hilda at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His visit hadn&#39;t been intended for reconciliation,but rather to establish unequivocally that Eleanor commanded too much respect to endure humiliation.He wanted Norwood to understand that Eleanor remained the treasured center of their universe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the Bentons&#39; departure, stunned silence filled the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout Breoqua, Benton Group commanded  commercial influence rivaling that of Stewart Group itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Presenting sixty percent of company shares plus the entire international division as wedding gifts essentially meant Jeff and Hilda were transferring control of the entire Benton empire to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face grew ashen with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Partially due to Jeff&#39;s public humiliation before so many witnesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Additionally, the prospect of forfeiting such enormous financial gain proved absolutely intolerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s expression appeared even more thunderous,her concealed hand slowly forming a tight fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had assumed Eleanor possessed minimal status,suitable only as a hidden mistress kept in the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had she anticipated Jeff and Hilda placing such extraordinary value on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized the necessity for a completely revised approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of obstacles, she remained absolutely determined to become Nolan&#39;s wife.</p>
