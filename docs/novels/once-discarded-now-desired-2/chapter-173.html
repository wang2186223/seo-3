                <p>Eleanor, completely unaware that she had been set up, had just wrapped things up at the Hope House and was preparing to head-back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped outside, her eyes fell on the familiar black Bentley quietly parked by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, she walked over, pulled the door open, and slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze instantly shifted toward her. His eyes lingered on her face, noticing the faint tiredness etched across her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead of speaking, he just kept staring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor adjusted her posture in the seat and suddenly let out a soft laugh. &#34;Nolan, you&#39;ve been watching me so intently. What is it? Are you afraid I&#39;ll suddenly vanish on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were meant as a lighthearted tease, but in the blink of an eye, Nolan flipped the tables on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips curved into the faintest smile as he leaned in, closing the distance until his breath brushed against her lips. &#34;Of course. You&#39;re so breathtaking.. if I lost you, where in this world could I ever find another like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him a glare, though her eyes betrayed more amusement than anger.&#34;Can&#39;t you talk properly for once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to scold him, but deep down, being cherished so openly warmed her in ways she didn&#39;t expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only problem was this man was growing more and more sentimental by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan,however,was captivated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That playful glare of hers lit something inside him, and he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how he had overlooked this side of her for so long. He was just about to close the distance and claim her lips when a black sedan screeched to a stop right in front of them, and a familiar figure stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was he doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could process it, Jeff stormed over, his face twisted in rage. He yanked open the car door and raised his hand, ready to slap Eleanor across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the blow could land, a strong hand caught his wrist mid-air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had already stepped out without anyone noticing. His presence was like a sudden chill, his gaze cutting through the air with deadly calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of pain shot through Jeff&#39;s wrist as Nolan tightened his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared he try to raise a hand against Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s cold stare was enough to freeze anyone in place, and a surge of anger bubbled under his calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With just a little more force, he could easily disable Jeff&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are your manners?&#34; Nolan&#39;s voice was dangerously calm.&#34;Or have you thrown away every shred of dignity you had, Mr. Benton?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s face went pale from the pain, but Nolan&#39;s words only made his own anger flare hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dignity?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need dignity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the recording Lainey had sent, Eleanor was the one who had tried to hurt Hilda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury had driven him straight here without even waiting for Fraser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not killing Eleanor already felt merciful. Dignity was the last thing on his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor noticed the hatred in Jeff&#39;s eyes and frowned in confusion. However, before she could ask anything, more cars pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was the first to leapo out, rushing toward the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right behind her came Fraser, followed by a woman being held back by a couple of bodyguards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards soon forced the woman to her knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she caught sight of Eleanor, she acted like she had found a lifeline, dropping to her knees and bowing desperately. Her face was wet with tears and streaked with snot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren! I can&#39;t hide it fromn you any longer! Please, just confess everything! You told me to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor listened quietly and then smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently released Nolan&#39;s hand and took a few calm steps forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the furious and puzzled stares of the crowd, she crouched down slowly, meeting Millie&#39;s terrified eyes.&#34;Do you realize that framing someone is against the law?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s voice was soft, but each word made Millie shiver uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, the threats Lainey had made, the promises of safety for her family, and her own fear collided in Millie&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in the end, the strongest instinct won out-the will to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a shaky breath, Millie found her voice. &#34;Miss Warren, you told me to do it! I got caught because of you.How can you just turn your back on me now?&#34;</p>
