                <p>Shoppers in the supermarket began to slow down,whispering and pointing at the commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady hated nothing more than being called a mistress or a homewrecker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temper flared as she raised her hand to strike Eleanor. &#34;Say that again,you cunt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor was faster. She caught Ady&#39;s wrist and shoved her hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady tumbled straight to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson,just done at the counter, rushed over to help her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady seized the chance, bursting into dramatic sobs.&#34;Colson, I can&#39;t bear this anymore! Your future daughter-in-law called me a homewrecker.You know I&#39;m not like that. I only love you too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson,softened by her tears, tried to soothe her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she calmed, he turned a cold gaze on Eleanor.&#34;Apologize!&#34; Eleanor rolled her eyes without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only fueled Colson&#39;s rage. He snapped, &#34;So you refuse, huh? Fine! Let&#39;s see how you marry Nolan without my approval!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a mocking laugh. &#34;And you really believe Nolan would listen to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie stepped in, her voice sharp. &#34;Exactly. Nolan stopped seeing you as a father long ago. Who do you think you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie rarely spoke like this, but today her anger spilled over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s glare shifted instantly to her.&#34;I&#39;m your father!Watch your tongue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady pretended to play peacemaker. &#34;Colson, let it go.Fannie&#39;s young and don&#39;t know better. I even gave her a card earlier, and she refused. She&#39;s still immature.Why take offense?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sounded gentle, but they were laced with thorns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Colson flared up. He stepped forward and grabbed Fannie. &#34;Apologize to your mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s eyes burned with defiance.&#34;Why should Colson&#39;s playful arrogance vanished. His tone turned dark. &#34;Because I&#39;m your father!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Reyna&#39;s children were nothing but trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie and Nolan were always against Ady-and against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Brodie was loyal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had seen shameless men before, but Colson was in a league of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She yanked Fannie back, shielding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes mocked him as she said, &#34;Father? You drove your wife to her death for a mistress and abanddoned your children.What kind of father does that make you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s face tightened, her words cutting deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And though it angered him, he knew she was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, in his heart, he felt no guilt. His love for Ady was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to argue, but Eleanor had already led Fannie away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enraged,Colson kicked the wall. &#34;I won&#39;t let a woman like her into our family!&#34; Ady,however,had her own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had looked into Eleanor and knew the woman was capable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor became Nolan&#39;s wife, it would be more difficult for them to bringing him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching his sleeve, Ady put on the mask of a gentle wife. &#34;Colson, Eleanor isn&#39;t worthy of Nolan. Why don&#39;t we choose someone better? You&#39;re his father -you still hold that power. Norwood&#39;s hard to influence, but if Nolan&#39;s wife were someone we could control-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her words trail off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Colson understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Nolan didn&#39;t see him as a father, he still had the the right to interfere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they replaced Eleanor with a girl of their choosing,the Stewart Group would slip right back into their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes gleamed as he turned to Ady. &#34;You&#39;re brilliant.Handle it. Destroy Eleanor&#39;s chances and find the right woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady leaned closer and whispered a name. Colson&#39;s eyes lit up, and a smug smile tugged at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Perfect. You take charge, Ady. Just tell me when to step in.&#34;</p>
