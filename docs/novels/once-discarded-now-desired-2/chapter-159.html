                <p>Lainey waited until Norwood had dozed off before slipping out of the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door closed behind her, the sweet,gentle look she wore disappeared completely,replaced by the hungry ambition burning inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only a matter of time before she became Nolan&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her top priority was to get rid of Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her current marriage would only drag her down.Even if she managed to push Eleanor out of the picture,being married to a man like Jonny would ruin her chances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, she pulled out her phone and quietly removed Jonny from her block list. Days later, Jonny nearly thought he was hallucinating when a message from Lainey popped up, inviting him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overjoyed, he took extra care in dressing that day,even stopping by a florist to pick up a bouquet of fresh roses before heading to the café she had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, you finally agreed to see me,&#34; he said, voice thick with longing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief second, Lainey&#39;s gaze flicked to the flowers. Then, with a sneer, she pulled a folder from her bag and tossed it across the table. &#34;Sign it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze, staring down at the papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes landed on the bold words at the top,anger instantly flashed across his face. &#34;Lainey, are you kidding me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had texted him saying she missed him, but what she gave him was a divorce agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey reclined lazily in her seat, her expression  laced with ridicule. She lifted her cup gracefully,sipping with deliberate poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;lf I hadn&#39;t said that, do you think you&#39;d be sitting here now? Let&#39;s not drag this out. It&#39;s pointless. If you sign now, you&#39;ll still walk away with something. But if you wait until my father steps in, neither you nor Todd Group will have a way out,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride, already hanging by a thread, snapped in that instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands shook as he clenched his teeth. &#34;Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey laughed softly, as though his defiance amused her. &#34;Don&#39;t be so hasty. Look at the terms first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had come prepared. She wouldn&#39;t have staged this meeting otherwise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sure enough, when Jonny&#39;s eyes landed on the figures written in black and white, his confidence wavered. A billion dollars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The agreement offered him a billion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that money, Todd Group could rise again from the ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then the other side of the scale tipped into his mind-Lainey&#39;s new position as the Benton family&#39;s daughter. That identity alone was worth far more than the billion sitting on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even just ten percent of the Benton Group&#39;s shares wouuld amount to tens of billions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jeff&#39;s doting nature, Lainey could easily gain such a share, and as long as they remained married,it would all count as marital assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One billion might have tempted him for a moment,but compared to tens of billions? The choice was a no-brainer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And on top of that, he still had a bit of dirt on Lainey he could use against her. He leaned forward, his lips curving into a threatening grin. &#34;Lainey, what do you suppose your parents or Norwood would say if I let slip what you did abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from her face in an instant. Her fingers trembled as she snatched up the coffee cup,ready to hurl it at him in a blind burst of rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jonny was quicker. He caught her wrist firmly, his voice cutting like ice. &#34;Face it, sweetheart. You&#39;re never getting rid of me. Not in this lifetime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released her with a shove, adjusted the collar of his suit, and walked away wearing the smug air of a man who believed he had already won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s body gave out, and she crumpled against the chair, her chest heaving with fury and terror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had to, she would make him pay with his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she got back to the Benton family&#39;s estate, Lainey had already put on her act. She messed up her hair, smudged her makeup a little, and made herself look weak and pitiful before walking in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Jeff saw her, his chest tightened in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey!&#34; he called out, rushing toward her. &#34;Tell me,who did this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey flinched at his tone, shrinking back like a frightened child. Her lips trembled as she whispered,&#34;Dad, l-I&#39;m fine. I just... I just fell. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
