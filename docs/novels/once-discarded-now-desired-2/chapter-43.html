                <p>After the polite greetings were exchanged, Sallie finally cut to the reason she had asked Eleanor out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I hate to burden you with this,&#34; she began gently, her tone almost hesitant. &#34;But the Todd Group... it represents the work and sacrifice of our family for generations. I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re on good terms with NJolan Stewart. Do you think... maybe you could persuade him to reinvest?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The request left Eleanor momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lashes lowered, masking the swirl of emotions in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it hadn&#39;t been for Sallie&#39;s help years ago, the Hope House would have crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had carried that kindness like a stone in her heart, the weight of it leading her, at one point, to  marry Jonny without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that debt had long been repaid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Nolan wasn&#39;t someone whose choices could be swayed so easily. He was unpredictable,unreadable-a man who kept even his closest rivals guessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no bond between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he alter a business decision just because she asked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie, noticing Eleanor&#39;s silence and the faint crease in her brow, let out a tired sigh. &#34;Eleanor, if it&#39;s too much to ask, then forget I said anything. This is our family&#39;s mess. It shouldn&#39;t trouble you anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a weary acceptance, as though she had already resigned herself to the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s heart softened. &#34;Sallie,&#34; she said quietly,&#34;if the opportunity comes, I&#39;ll bring it up to Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was, after all, only a matter of words. Whether fate  chose to spare the Todd Group, that was something no one could control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor left the restaurant, she pulled out her phone. Her eyes lingered on a name glowing on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to bring this up to Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it would be better to wait for another time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small sigh, she slipped the phone back into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan was well-informed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t need her to speak for him to know what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time half a day had passed, his network had already fed him the details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped his fingers lightly on the desk, a smile slowly tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Eleanor come to him for Sallie&#39;s sake? He thought she would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She disliked Jonny, but her heart was soft. How could she watch Sallie, aging and worried, carry the weight of a crumbling company?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would only take her a fewv words to ease Sallie&#39;s burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,Nolan was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days passed, and Eleanor never mentioned a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,it seemed he had underestimated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In rare good humor, he turned to Erick. &#34;Get the car ready. We&#39;re going to the Hope House to pick up Fannie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luck seemed to be on Nolan&#39;s side that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they arrived, Eleanor, broom in hand, was carefully sweeping leaves from the yard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan crossed the distance in long, confident strides. What,you weren&#39;t going to ask me for a hand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for a moment before lifting her head,her eyes narrowing slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Elepdon, little escaped Nolan&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she hadn&#39;t thought he would confront her about it so directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his gaze, she replied coolly, &#34;Well, message delivered. Whether you reinvest in the Todd Group,that&#39;s up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, she turned away and began sweeping in another corner, not sparing a single word in defense of the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan felt the corners of his lips twitch with a quiet amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to speak again when Fannie came running over, her eyes bright. &#34;Nolan, what are you and Eleanor talking about in hushed voices?&#34; He shifted his attention to her, his tone casual.&#34;Nothing important. Eleanor just owes someone a debt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie tilted her head, her clear eyes blinking in thought. &#34;Then why not help her? If it&#39;s too expensive, just dock it from my allowance next month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint glimmer passed through Nolan&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already made up his mind to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing Eleanor&#39;s obligations to the Todd family was an investment worth every bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What intrigued him more was how she would choose to repay him in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he found himself genuinely anticipating it.</p>
