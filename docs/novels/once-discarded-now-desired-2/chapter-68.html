                <p>Emma felt a jolt of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty should have been on the Todd family&#39;s side, so why was she defending Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her mind scrambled to make sense of it, Lainey approached alone, moving confidently through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny was still mingling with the men, sipping his drink, completely oblivious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, this was her stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey offered a polite smile and greeted, &#34;Besty, it&#39;s good to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty wasn&#39;t great at remembering faces, and she didn&#39;t immediately place Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the dress? That she recognized instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same gown she had recently sought Eleanor&#39;s special permission to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had quoted ten million for it-a price she rarely entertained for any project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Lainey must be friends with Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise,why would Eleanor have told her to attend the wedding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, Besty composed herself, bowing her head slightly. &#34;Miss Gilbert, congratulations. I apologize for coming so abruptly without a gift. I promise to visit soon and make it up to you and Mr. Todd with a token of my appreciation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests around them were taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty from Enigma Group spoke with such courtesy to Lainey? All those whispers about their closeness must have been true!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey let herself bask in the moment, savoring every second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spending that ten million had been worth it; she could practically feel Elepdon&#39;s elite social circles opening up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor would no longer dare mock her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her composure, Lainey smiled graciously. &#34;You&#39;re far too kind, Besty. It&#39;s such an honor that you could attend my wedding despite your busy schedule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty gave a quick nod, but her gaze immediately flicked toward Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked subtly, as if silently asking, &#34;Boss, did that work for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Nolan noticed it all. His earlier suspicions seemed to be confirmed. How many more of Eleanor&#39;s tricks were still hidden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt his gaze burn into her back and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would he ever stop staring?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan met her eyes directly, lifting his eyebrows, almost as if to say,&#34;I&#39;ve seen through you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s heart skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he have some kind of X-ray vision?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Besty had only exchanged a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had to be a trick;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he was just trying to get under her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding it was safer to ignore him, she turned away, refusing to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Emma, witnessing the charged moment, couldn&#39;t hold back her fury. On impulse, she snatched a glass of wine from a passing waiter and flung it at Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,pretending to be shocked, she held her chest.&#34;Oh, Eleanor! I&#39;m terribly sorry. I didn&#39;t manage to hold it right. You&#39;re so gracious; I know it&#39;s fine, isn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had used this stunt countless times over the past three years, and Eleanor had never once reacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, cozying up to the Stewart and the Brooks families, Eleanor was still that same foolish girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But suddenly, red wine spilled everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma froze, staring at the empty glass in Eleanor&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her brother&#39;s wedding!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I&#39;ll kill you!&#34; Emma screamed, charging forward without a second thought.</p>
