                <p>Lainey slipped closer and wrapped her hand around Jeff&#39;s arm, speaking in a soft, playful tone. &#34;Dad, I already told you, Nolan only acted that way because the Brooks siblings poisoned his mind. He&#39;s actually a good man. Please, just give him a chance and work with him, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff didn&#39;t push further into why Lainey seemed so fixated on this idea of partnering with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of contemplation, his fondness for his daughter won out over his doubts.&#34;Alright.We&#39;ll talk about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she saw Jeff so agreeable, Lainey&#39;s eyes lit up, and she quickly added, &#34;Could you let me be the project director of Benton Group at home? You know I&#39;m divorcing Jonny, which means I can&#39;t stay at the Todd Group. I should have something of my own to focus on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff was just about to give his approval when a firm voice cut through from the doorway.&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Hilda, who had just walked up and happened to overhear everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey really was ambitious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, she wanted to step into her real daughter&#39;s place, and now she wanted to get a job in Benton Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over her dead body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Hilda couldn&#39;t outright reject her too harshly, or Lainey might start suspecting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she softened her tone and explained as though she were being reasonable. &#34;Lainey, you can be a team leader, but not the project director. That position has already been promised to someone we brought back from Breoqua. He&#39;s very experienced with the new energy projects. With him guiding you, you&#39;ll definitely learn faster and do even better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a team leader? To Lainey, that was far beneath the dignity of a Benton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she pull strings or exert any real authority from such a low position? Lainey&#39;s expression soured when she heard that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, Eleanor had ruined everything. That woman was becoming a thorn too dangerous to leave alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred boiled inside her, but she didn&#39;t notice Hilda watching her closely from the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Hilda understood that apart from Lillian, Lainey also had a grudge against Nolan&#39;s girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That little detail was far too important to forget, and Hilda mentally tucked it away for later use.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Lainey had already covered up her scowl, replacing it with a bright, determined look. &#34;Dad, I love challenges. Why don&#39;t you let me handle it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff hesitated, NNolan&#39;s warning still echoing in his mind.&#34;There&#39;s no need. Our family already stands as equals with the Stewarts. You don&#39;t need to put yourself through unnecessary disrespect on our behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey refused to back down. She leaned in, her voice steady but persuasive. &#34;This deal with the Stewart Group is critical for where we&#39;re headed. I don&#39;t want to let personal grudges ruin such a chance. If enduring a little discomfort can help the family, then it&#39;s worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff was genuinely touched by her words. With a nod, he softened. &#34;Alright then, if that&#39;s how you feel,go ahead and give it a try.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, his daughter wasn&#39;t just exceptional-her thoughtfulness and understanding made her truly remarkable.</p>
