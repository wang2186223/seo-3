                <p>The storm that had besieged the Stewart Group finally dissipated, leaving the once-glorious White and the Perry families teetering on the edge of ruin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Zerovia, the wheels of justice turned swiftly. Within mere days, Tyler was whisked away by authorities,his fate sealed as they probed his misdeeds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a thunderous proclamation echoed through Elepdon; Tyler had been stripped of his power, cast out for twisting his authority to stifle fair competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news sent shockwaves rippling across the city igniting whispers and gasps in every corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Perry family&#39;s collapse spread like wildfire, their empire crumbling under the weight of disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Perry family&#39;s closest ally, the White family found themselves stripped of their strongest pillar.Their once-dominant market share became a tantalizing prize, ripe for the taking by ravenous competitors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel, desperate to salvage his family&#39;s legacy,dashed between Elepdon&#39;s towering enterprises, his pride swallowed as he begged for aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his pleas fell on deaf ears, met only with icy rejections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. White, kindly see yourself out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our small company can offer no assistance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve crossed the Stewart, the Brooks, and the Benton families... we dare not tangle with such titans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shunned like a pariah, Miguel stood alone amidst the city&#39;s bustling streets, a broken man in a sea of indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had it come to this?  How had the tides turned so drastically?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel&#39;s mind reeled, as he grappled with the enigma of Nolan&#39;s influence and the mystery of Eleanor&#39;s true power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret surged through him like a bitter tide,threatening to drown his spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He staggered home, only to be greeted not by the familiar embrace of his estate but by a stark white seal plastered across the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An enforcement vehicle loomed ominously before him, and stern-faced officials approached, thrusting a document into his trembling hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. White,&#34; one officer began, voice devoid of warmth, &#34;by court order, all assets of the White Group, including your properties and vehicles, are hereby frozen and under investigation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world seemed to crumble beneath Miguel&#39;s feet,his vision blurring as he swayed, on the brink of collapse.  Not far away, Trudy stood frozen, her gaze fixed blankly on the seal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her once radiant face now held only bewilderment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind refused to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t her grandfather the unchallenged titan of Elepdon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would dare challenge them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had to be a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t targeted Eleanor, if she hadn&#39;t chased Nolan&#39;s affection with such fervor, if she hadn&#39;t spurred Tyler to crush the Stewart Group,would their world still be intact?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White family&#39;s glory would remain untarnished-and she would still live as the pampered girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But regrets were futile now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel&#39;s bloodshot gaze locked onto Trudy, fury blazing within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her fault!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged forward, his hand slicing through the air,delivering a stinging slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You reckless fool!&#34; he roared. &#34;All for a man, you&#39;ve dragged our family into ruin! A century of legacy,shattered-because of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The flicker of remorse in Trudy&#39;s heart twisted into venomous hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should she bear the blame?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The true culprit was Eleanor, the architect of their downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not let this go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed to remember this debt, determined that one day Eleanor would repay it a thousandfold.</p>
