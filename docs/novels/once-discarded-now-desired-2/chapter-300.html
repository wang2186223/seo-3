                <p>When Nolan stepped into the villa, he found his personal doctor already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This visit, the physician carried an array of medical equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After performing a detailed examination on Elora, the man hesitated, his solemn face betraying the weight of his findings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s voice trembled with worry as she asked,&#34;Please, just tell us! What&#39;s happening to Elora?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor clenched his jaw and replied, &#34;She&#39;s been neglecting proper meals for too long, leaving her physically frail. On top of that, prolonged mistreatment has taken a toll on her mind. She requires balanced nutrition and emotional care.Otherwise-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His unfinished words hung in the air, but both Nolan and Fannie instantly grasped the meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In plain truth, Elora was struggling with depression brought on by her abusive ex. If nothing changed, she might share Reyna&#39;s tragic fate of ending her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, shaken by the thought, slammed his hand against the wall, anger burning inside him. &#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Elora opened her eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flickered with confusion. &#34;Nolan, didn&#39;t you go? You should leave. Don&#39;t keep your fiancée waiting I&#39;ll manage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the physician&#39;s warning, Nolan softened his voice. &#34;Elora, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll stay here with you today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t endure the thought of losing another person close to him to depression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie quickly added in a soothing tone, &#34;Elora, relax.Eleanor is a kind person. You&#39;ll understand once you meet her. Just stay here peacefully and stop worrying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she seemed uncertain, Elora eventually nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled gently with resignation. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do as you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eleanor knew nothing of this. After she read Nolan&#39;s message, the brief spark of joy in her heart dimmed. Still,she chose to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan managed the Stewart Group, a massive corporation, so constant busyness was inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet disappointment continued gnawing inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Descending the staircase,Hilda noticed Eleanor hadn&#39;t gone out and frowned in surprise. &#34;Sweetie, weren&#39;t you planning some fun? Why are you still here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor forced a casual smile. &#34;Nolan had an urgent matter, so our outing&#39;s off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She truly didn&#39;t take it to heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the following days, Nolan&#39;s actions turned strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like he had vanished completely from her world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other than brief morning and night texts, he sent nothing-no extra greetings, not even one call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The distance between them felt as though they had become strangers again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasn&#39;t prone to suspicion, yet unease coiled tighter in her chest eachday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What occupied him so much? Should she go to Regal Heights?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could act, her phone buzzed with Lillian&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! I&#39;ve been dumped!&#34; Lillian cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shrill wailing was so intense that Eleanor pulled the phone away from her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even heard of Lillian dating anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it yet another fleeting crush on some guy younger than her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pondering that, she asked, &#34;Lillian, who exactly dumped you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through sobs, Lillian barely managed to breathe.&#34;Fraser&#39;s going on a blind date! How could he do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor rubbed her aching temples, realizing once again how oddly Lillian&#39;s mind worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A one-sided obsession with no actual progress had somehow turned into heartbreak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Eleanor reflected, an unfamiliar male voice entered the call politely. &#34;Hello, are you her friend?She&#39;s drunk. Could you come take her home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a sigh. She couldn&#39;t possibly leave her closest friend stranded in the street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After receiving the location, she hailed a cab and set out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the restaurant, Lillian was sprawled across the table, empty bottles scattered around, mumbling curses at Fraser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paid the bill, then struggled to lift her drunken friend toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they reached the entrance, two figures appeared before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tall man standing there was Nolan, the very person she had waited for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his side, a woman in a white dress clung tightly to his arm, leaning against him with a sweet smile as she whispered.</p>
