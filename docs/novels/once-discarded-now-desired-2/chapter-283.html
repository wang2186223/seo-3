                <p>Hilda returned from Regal Heights and threw herself into the warmth of her kitchen, a cherished cookbook spread wide before her like an open invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over twenty years, she had missed the chance to know Eleanor&#39;s favorite meals, each missed moment a quiet ache in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she poured her love into learning new recipes,dreaming of the day she could hand-deliver a dish to her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Eleanor held her at arm&#39;s length, the thought of her tasting her cooking was a soothing balm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she jotted notes in the cookbook&#39;s margins, Hilda called out with a playful spark, &#34;Love, come tackle this fish with me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, sporting his cartoon apron similar to Hilda&#39;s,sauntered in with a vibrant tray of freshly sliced fruit. &#34;Your sous-chef, reporting for duty,&#34; he teased,setting the tray down and wielding a knife with finesse to prep the fish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether or not Eleanor chose to accept them,they still carried a profound sense of indebtedness to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had made peace with the circumstances,resolved to embrace whatever path Eleanor chose.Her happiness was all that mattered to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, the doorbell chimed through the villa,accompanied by the butler&#39;s exuberant announcement. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Benton, Miss Warren is here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s spatula slipped from her grasp, clattering to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Jeff shared a glance brimming with delight,hastening outside, their aprons still tied about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa&#39;s gates, Eleanor stood beside Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan carried an array of elegantly wrapped gift boxes,his demeanor warm and composed. Hilda&#39;s eyes were riveted on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was truly here, returning to them at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught in a surge of emotion, Hilda instinctively wiped her hands on her apron before stepping forward, yearning to clasp Eleanor&#39;s hand yet pausing,uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, you... you&#39;ve come home,&#34; she murmured,her voice quivering, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. &#34;Why didn&#39;t you let us know? I would have prepared all your favorite dishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor met Hilda&#39;s gaze, a whirlwind of excitement,slight apprehension, and overwhelming joy at their reunion shimmering in her mother&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Nolan, standing steadfastly by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He offered a reassuring nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a throat tight with emotion, Eleanor softly uttered the words she had longed to say. &#34;Dad Mom.&#34; Their stunned expressions prompted Eleanor to lower her eyes, her voice gentle as she continued,&#34;Nolan and I would love to join you for dinner tonight.Would that be all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Jeff and Hilda were swept away by a tide of elation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they heard correctly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their daughter was acknowledging them, calling them Dad and Mom!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Without question!&#34; Hilda&#39;s tears of joy broke free as she enveloped Eleanor in a fervent embrace, her cheeks wet with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear, what are you saying? This is your home-come back whenever your heart desires!&#34; Jeff&#39;s voice trembled with feeling. This titan of industry,usually so commanding, now stood with eyes reddened by emotion, his words thick with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded enthusiastically and turned to the butler with spirited instructions. &#34;Quickly, prepare Eleanor&#39;s room with the finest linens!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he turned back to Eleanor, his tone softening.&#34;Eleanor, you and Nolan must stay the night. Don&#39;t even think of leaving!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He murmured to himself, as if struck by a sudden thought. &#34;Oh, and one more thing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He addressed the butler. &#34;Arrange a grand feast! Let the world know my daughter has returned!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler, his face alight with shared joy, eagerly agreed and turned to carry out the orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; Eleanor interjected softly, halting him with a gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amid the bewildered glances exchanged around her,Eleanor spoke with quiet conviction. &#34;Dad, I don&#39;t want a grand banquet. A simple family dinner together is all I need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff felt a pang of disappointment ripple through him. He yearned to proclaim Eleanor&#39;s return to the world,to right the wrongs of the past two decades, and shower her with the love she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, catching the faint shadow of reserve in her eyes,he softened, nodding with understanding. &#34;Very well my dear. We&#39;ll do exactly as you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, standing quietly to the side, observed the tender scene, his eyes reflecting a thoughtful depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s heart still held a fragile barrier, not yet fully lowered. But that was alright-time was their gentle ally.</p>
