                <p>After leaving the Elepdon Sanatorium, Eleanor made her way back to the villa in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed up deep into the night, hoping Nolan would come through the door, but he never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was morning then that finally brought Nolan home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t bother with greetings; he simply closed the gap between them and wrapped Eleanor tightly in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting his face against her neck, Nolan breathed in her gentle, familiar scent, finally feeling the knot in his chest begin to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa&#39;s safe now. I owe you, Eleanor. Thank you so much&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lifted a hand and gently smoothed the tension from his brow. &#34;There&#39;s no need to thank me.Not when it&#39;s us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their quiet moment was suddenly interrupted by Lillian&#39;s enthusiastic voice ringing out in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! Let us in! Ryland and I came to visit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dramatic flourish, Lillian burst through the door and engulfed Eleanor in an enthusiastic hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland trailed behind her, arms full of grocery bags,and a wave of relief crossed his face the moment he saw Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The shipment made it to the buyer overseas.&#34;Ryland set the groceries down and continued, &#34;It took some effort, but the deal&#39;s finished. The client signed, and we have the Benton family to thank for smoothing things over. If not, we would&#39;ve been hit with a massive penalty. As for Zerovia-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Nolan stepped in and stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll handle this in the study,&#34; Nolan said quietly. He didn&#39;t want Eleanor tangled up in these troubles any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already given more than enough for him and for the entire Stewart family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, it was his responsibility to see things through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft click, the study door shut, blocking out the rest of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan turned to Ryland, his gaze sharp and unyielding. &#34;What&#39;s going on in Zerovia?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s expression shifted, the gravity of the situation written all over his face. &#34;Nolan, your father&#39;s already on to you. He&#39;s been using the Stewart Group&#39;s name behind the scenes to stir up trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, relentless anger radiated from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nolan, Colson was just a relative by blood, nothing more than a biological connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson had never acted like a true parent, and now he was willing to sabotage both the family and the country for his own interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unforgivable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spread the word,&#34; Nolan instructed, his tone cold and unyielding like steel. &#34;From now on, Colson and Brodie are completely severed from the Stewart family. They have no right to speak or act for the Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Ryland gave a firm nod. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll make sure everyone gets the message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the business handled, Ryland&#39;s shoulders finally loosened, and he nudged Nolan playfully. &#34;Seriously,man, you really lucked out with Eleanor. She&#39;s sharp,strong, and she&#39;d fight the world if it meant having your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan shot him a sideways look, the hint of a smile playing at his lips. &#34;Sounds like you&#39;re envious. Go find someone like that for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland laughed but quickly pivoted back to more serious matters. &#34;Alright, jokes aside, have you made any progress on that tax problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We pinned everything on the CFO. The evidence is airtight, so we can charge him with fraud and get him locked up.However-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, voice dropping lower. &#34;If the Perry family keeps pushing the issue, we&#39;re still at risk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland understood immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compared to this, the shipment problem was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the authorities slapped Stewart Group with a tax evasion charge, it would spell disaster for everyone involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s face grew grim. &#34;Zerovia&#39;s a tough nut to crack, and Tyler Perry isn&#39;t going down easily.Have you thought about reaching out to Trudy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s answer was immediate. &#34;I&#39;m not meeting  her.&#34; There was no way he would agree to meet with a woman he despised, especially not if it meant making Eleanor unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland let out a low laugh and shook his head.&#34;Man,you really are loyal down to your bones,Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan just grinned and gave him a light punch on the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the living room, Lillian clung to Eleanor&#39;s hand, letting her frustration pour out.&#34;Trudy&#39;s unbelievable! She couldn&#39;t win Nolan over,so now she&#39;s going after the Stewart Group with all these dirty tactics. It&#39;s disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could anyone stoop that low?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian used to think Trudy was just a pampered rich girl, but now she realized just how spiteful and toxic she could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gently squeezed Lillian&#39;s hand to calm her.&#34;Don&#39;t let her get to you. She&#39;s running out of  options.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes gleamed with curiosity. &#34;What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor offered a sly, knowing smile. &#34;You&#39;ll see soon enough. For now, let&#39;s keep it between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian put on an exaggerated pout. &#34;What, I&#39;m not in the loop anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a bit of gentle persuasion, Eleanor finally succeeded in lifting her spirits.</p>
