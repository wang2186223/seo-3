                <p>It seemed Lainey&#39;s mention of splitting up had touched a raw nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Jonny arrived at the company with Laineyand immediately called the executives together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From this moment on, Lainey Gilbert is my secretary. She&#39;ll oversee every decision concerning the Usepsall project. Her words carry the same weight as mine. Clear?&#34; Jonny declared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executives nodded in unison without hesitation.&#34;Understood, Mr. Todd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, everyone knew Lainey was the one Jonny treasured most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one would dare slight her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he saw everything settled, Jonny lightly touched the top of Lainey&#39;s head. &#34;I&#39;ve got a meeting to attend, so I&#39;ll head out. Someone will take you around the company in the meantime. There&#39;s a new restaurant nearby everyone&#39;s talking about. I&#39;ll bring you there for lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey lowered her gaze with a bashful smile and murmured,&#34;Okay, Jonny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny had clearly fallen under her charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if her position came through personal ties,Jonny&#39;s influence guaranteed that every executive showed Lainey the highest respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard Moss, the head of Planning Department,promptly handed her a file. &#34;Lainey, these are the proposed demolition sites for the Usepsall project.Take a look. If everything checks out, I&#39;ll pass them along to the shareholders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey accepted the folder and skimmed through the pages without much thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she was about to shut it, her eyes froze on two words: &#34;Hope House.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t that the orphanage where Eleanor had grown up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before coming back to the country, Lainey had already done her research.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea crossed her mind, and she pointed carelessly. &#34;Add this site too. It&#39;s close to Ravenswood River, and riverside housing could be developed there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard traced her gesture and frowned in disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew the location carried almost no commercial worth, and tearing it down would be nothing but trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, about this site-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he finished, Lainey cut him off. &#34;Allard, are you forgetting what Jonny said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice sounded calm, but there was an edge in it that warned him not to push further. Allard didn&#39;t dare argue. He nodded quickly and bent slightly. &#34;Yes, I&#39;ll handle it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he rushed off, Lainey&#39;s smile grew wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if Eleanor would appreciate the little &#34;gift&#34; she had prepared. Compete with her? How foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the document arrived at Stewart Group, Erick intercepted it without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried it straight to the president&#39;s office. &#34;Mr.Stewart, the Todd Group has just released their Usepsall project plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan leaned back in his leather chair,barely glancing up at the words. &#34;Put it down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed a steady rhythm against the desk. &#34;Anything from the Underground Network?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick set the file on the desk where it belonged,but he didn&#39;t move away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing yet.&#34; He hesitated before adding,&#34;Mr. Stewart, one of the proposed sites in Todd Group&#39;s plan is the Hope House. Should I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stopped tapping and slowly turned his head toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the folder and studied it with sharp focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years earlier, Stewart Group had invested heavily in the Usepsall project, only for Eleanor to snatch it away at the final stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan hadn&#39;t pulled his money back, choosing instead to use it as a way to measure Eleanor&#39;s ability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor was shrewd, rarely leaving any weak points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Hope House was listed for demolition, he was eager to see how she would handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, he placed the document back on the desk, a faint smile tugging at his lips. &#34;Get in touch with Eleanor. Remind her she still owes me a favor from the last exhibition.&#34;</p>
