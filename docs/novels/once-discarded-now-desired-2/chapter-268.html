                <p>Trudy never imagined Eleanor would voice such words in front of everyone, and her face soured instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, recalling the backing she enjoyed from both her and Nolan&#39;s grandfathers, she steadied herself in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She adjusted her crumpled gown, recovered her refined bearing, and retorted in a calm, measured voice, &#34;Eleanor, you misrepresent everything.Whatever ties you share wth Nolan amount only to a fleeting affair unworthy of serious acknowledgment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sudden shift in tone, she carried on, &#34;Yet I remain generous. As long as Nolan feels content,I have no complaints. I promised Norwood a chess match, so I must excuse myself. I shall not intrude further.&#34; After saying this, Trudy pivoted gracefully and exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood stunned beyond words, breath caught in her throat. &#34;Eleanor! How can she display such brazen audacity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, however, stayed composed, resting her palm lightly on Lillian&#39;s hand as a quiet reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, nevertheless, refused to move past it. Why should Eleanor bear the stigma of being a mnistress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Around them, reporters and fans surged forward,unleashing a storm of questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Brooks, how do you answer the rumors flooding the Internet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t Enigma and Nolan have an engagement? Why is she being branded as another woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Enigma truly despised by the Stewart family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the uproar, Lillian&#39;s fury deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she recognized Trudy&#39;s remarkable skill at distorting reality. As her eyes swept the flashing cameras, inspiration struck suddenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Trudy chose to engage in the battle of public opinion, Lillian resolved to join the game and let her suffer the consequences of her own schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would never allow anyone to trample Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the store, Trudy slid into the Maybach idling nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sank into the leather seat, uunfastened her earrings, and tossed them into the armrest box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next, she drew out her phone, scrolling through the online chatter with amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved with satisfaction as she discovered the earlier drama had already climbed to the top of trending searches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Very soon, the world would accept that she was destined to become Nolan&#39;s wife, while Eleanor was reduced to a mere mistress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relishing the thought, Trudy started the engine,riding high on triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her elation quickly dissolved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Barely two junctions later, her phone rang shrilly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Answering, she heard her father, Miguel White,raging. &#34;Did you step foot in Enigma&#39;s shop today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy, unconcerned, answered lightly, &#34;Yes. Eleanor marked an important day, so I went to offer congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel exploded. &#34;Congratulations? Do you grasp that White Group&#39;s stock is collapsing? Enigma&#39;s fans are boycotting our products everywhere! Why would you upset her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s head spun, blank and ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stock collapsing? How was that even possible? Without a moment to process, she slammed the phone down, pulled over to the curb, and shaking,tapped open her social media app.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trending list had shifted, overtaken by tags like #Enigma&#39;sFansAgainstSlander,#TrudyThelntruder,#TrudyApologizeToEleanor,	and #BoycottingWhiteGroup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could everything unravel so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rattled and panicked, she clicked the hottest post,a long piece written by one of Enigma&#39;s prominent fans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline struck like a blow. It read, &#34;Exposing Trudy&#39;s Hypocrisy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The article displayed a detailed chronological chart,documenting every milestone of Eleanor and Nolan&#39;s romance, each backed by media coverage or event photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s name appeared only six months after Eleanor and Nolan had declared their relationship publicly. After that came viral snapshots portraying the so-called &#34;mistress flaunting happiness while the real partner wept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each image was dissected meticulously, frame by frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The piece ended with surveillance video from Enigma&#39;s boutique, capturing Trudy declaring herself Nolan&#39;s fiancée.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comment thread seethed with outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! What a twist-Trudy White is vile.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With that performance, she should join the theater.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My heart goes out to Lillian, insulted so viciously by such deceit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Eleanor-how unjust, being with Nolan from the start yet branded an intruder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;White Group? Say no more. I&#39;m done buying from them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s vision blurred as she scrolled. She never dreamed Eleanor&#39;s supporters wielded such force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeat stared her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet none of it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Online uproar was meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had a secure marriage with Nolan, she remained victorious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought dulled her fury slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, watching the online insults pile up alongside White Group&#39;s tumbling stock prices, she couldn&#39;t quell her resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She vowed not to forgive, and resolved to make Eleanor and Lillian suffer greatly for today&#39;s disgrace.</p>
