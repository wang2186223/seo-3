                <p>Nolan fought to sit up, reaching for Eleanor&#39;s handas if it were his last anchor. His gaze, soft and hazy wvith affection, made him look heartbreakingly defenseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, listen... You should go. Please don&#39;t bother with me. Just let me handle this on my own.&#34; He finished his little performance by tossing her hand aside with exaggerated flair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nearly laughed out loud at his theatrics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was such a convincing performer, she thought he could have made a fortune in movies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could she just leave him in a hospital bed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew what kind of trouble he would get into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing him to the Stewart family&#39;s estate would hand Norwood exactly what he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s options had run out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaw clenched in reluctant resignation, Eleanor announced, &#34;You&#39;re coming to my apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The split second of victory that flickered across Nolan&#39;s face vanished before anyone else could catch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After returning home, Eleanor guided Nolan over and eased him onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Nolan clung to her, his body burning with fever as he pulled her close. His uneven breaths and unwavering gaze made it seem like she was the only thing anchoring him to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, he had gotten what he wanted: to sleep over at Eleanor&#39;s place, basking in her warmth and the comfort of her familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A restless heat surged through Nolan, desperate for release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What would Eleanor do? Would she use her hands to offer relief... or take things in another direction entirely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Nolan&#39;s thoughts ran wild with fantasies, Eleanor silently pulled out a sleek metal box from her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She popped i open, revealing an array of needles lined up neatly inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made Nolan&#39;s bravado vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in the world was she planning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before panic could set in, Eleanor selected a needle and, with practiced precision, pressed it into his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s cry filled the room, but within moments, sleep overtook him, pulling him under.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before he lost consciousness, he caught a glimpse of Eleanor&#39;s playful smirk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heartless,he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really was something else, absolutely ruthless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Daylight was streaming in when Nolan finally regained consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan blinked the haze from his eyes, mind surprisingly clear, though a sharp ache pulsed through his left palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed himself upright, scanning his surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s familiar bedroom greeted him, still wrapped in her soft, unmistakable scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, the space felt empty as she was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had she gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After tossing aside the blanket, Nolan wandered into the living room, but it was just as empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A neatly prepared breakfast, sandwich, and a glass of milk waited on the table, accompanied by a handwritten note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve gone to meet with the Benton family. Don&#39;t skip breakfast.&#34; The mention of the Benton family sent a chill through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression hardened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared the Benton family reach out to Eleanor after what Lainey had done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did they really believe his family was so easy to provoke?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he would sit by and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since their return, the Benton family had been making power plays at every turn. What if they picked on Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, inside a high-end restaurant in WNesthaven, a man sat quietly in a private booth, middle-aged, composed, carrying himself with effortless poise. It was none other than Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone had rung late last night, and on the other end, Lainey&#39;s voice was thick with tears. She said that she had been set up, blaming a woman named Eleanor Warren for everything.According to Lainey, Eleanor was ruthless, hell-bent on destroying her reputation and determined to see her locked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had done everything in his power to get Lainey out, only to be told that the charges were far too serious for any chance at bail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Lainey sob helplessly tore at his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Hilda had spent more than two decades searching for their lost daughter, and now that they had finally reunited, he would never let anyone push her around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As far as he was concerned, Eleanor probably just wanted a payout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any problem that could be settled with money wasn&#39;t really a problem at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,the moment Jeff lifted his head and saw Eleanor standing there, every harsh accusation died on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was struck by the uncanny resemblance. The shape of her eyes, the arch of her brows, so much like Hilda&#39;s when she was young. Even her aura matched as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening here?</p>
