                <p>Lainey rotuggd to surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thrashed violently, shiriekirig und Her volce brdks with hysterfa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!I didny do tt!&#34; she shouted. &#34;Thls ts a lle! You&#39;ro setting me e양!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze locked onto the kneeling man, &#39;blazing with desperate intenslty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who put you up to this?&#34; she stopped fust short of narning Eleanor aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet!&#34; The judge, growing intolerant of further disruptions, struck the gavel and flxed Lainey with a stern stare. &#34;The evidence cannot be disputed. What more remains to debate? If you continue to accuse others without proof, defamation oharges will follow!°</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He declared a ten-minute break, allowing the panel to deliberate before rendering the verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At thls, Lainey&#39;s energy drained completely, and she collapsed into the defendant&#39;s chair,paralyzed by fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the trial began, the Gilbort family&#39;s lawyer had repeatedly urged her to deflect responsibility,insisting she claim coercion had forcod her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, she might endure prison but still preserve her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not want to die; she genuinely feared death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the spectator seats, voices rose in sharp condemnation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who would&#39;ve imagined? She seems harmless but hides a cruel heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.She nearly destroyed Enigma. Serves her perfectly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Justice will triumph!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation clawed at Lainey as she scanned the room, clinging to the tiniest spark of hope. Her eyes fell on Jeff, seated prominently in the front row.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of relief lit her expression. She stared pleadingly, silently begging for aid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once cherished her, treating her like a daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, his gaze returned nothing but revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for this malicious woman, he wouldn&#39;t have confused her for his real child, losing precious time with the daughter he truly loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Lainey, Eleanor still refused to call him Dad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He longed to strip Lainey of everything, caring nothing for her survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw Jeff remain unmoved, Lainey&#39;s last fragile hope disintegrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage engulfed her, and all pent-up resentment erupted violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You stubborn, foolish man!&#34; she screamed toward him. &#34;Everything is your fault! Had you not taken me in,would I suffer like this now? Every one of you deserves death! I&#39;ll haunt you eternally!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips curved faintly, a cold smile forming in response to the frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly and spoke, voice smooth yet chilling. &#34;You misunderstand: Considering the atrocities you&#39;ve committed, haunting us might not even be possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ten-minute break ended abruptly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge returned, and the courtroom rose, weighted with solemn tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey trembled uncontrollably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The judge lifted the verdict, preparing to announce it, when an unassuming man in the crowd, hat pulled low, spoke. &#34;Your Honor, I believe Lainey Gilbert is not a citizen of this nation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze tightened with intensity, and the judge&#39;s words froze midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This fact had been overlooked entirely. The judge scanned the files quickly, his expression shifting with each page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Documents confirmed that after studying abroad, Lainey had obtained Zerovia citizenship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to Daulcan law, foreigners could not receive the death penalty unless involved in extreme offenses, like drug trafficking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, who had been shaking with dread, suddenly erupted into manic laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leveled a defiant stare at Eleanor and Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite their wishes, she had survived this battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Eleanor held their silence, eyes tracing the voice&#39;s source, but the man had vanished completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following an urgent consultation with the Zerovia embassy, the court adhered to international extradition and trial agréements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was convicted on multiple counts but sentenced to life imprisonment instead of execution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The courtroom erupted in disbelief. Anger and outrage filled the gallery as voices clamored in protest.</p>
