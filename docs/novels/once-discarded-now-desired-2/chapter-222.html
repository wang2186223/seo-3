                <p>Nolan offered no explanation. Instead, a rare seriousness took over his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared deeply at Eleanor, emotion swirling in his gaze. &#34;Eleanor, let&#39;s skip all the detours. Why don&#39;t we get engaged?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stunned her into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts scattered in every direction,struggling to catch up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engagement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did that even come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still owed her an explanation for everything. And what about his grandfather? Wouldn&#39;t hestand in their way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think your grandfather would ever go along with this?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet, almost daring laugh escaped Nolan. &#34;I&#39;m the one choosing a fiancée, not him. His opinion isn&#39;t part of my plan.&#34; Warmth bloomed in Eleanor&#39;s chest, leaving her breathless for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years spent in the orphanage left her yearning for the kind of belonging most people took for granted, a place, a family, a sense of home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marrying into the Todd family was her way of repaying Sallie for her kindness, but deep down, she also longed for the comfort that came with being part of a family. In the end, though, that sense of belonging turned out to be nothing more than a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Nolan gave off a sense of safety that she had never known before in her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was willing to take on anything for her sake, always keeping her close and guarding her with steady,unwavering care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan was her answer, what reason did she have to hesitate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met his earnest eyes and, heart racing, whispered,&#34;Yes.I want that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A genuine smile broke across Nolan&#39;s face, the relief clear in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been bracing for rejection, but now the fear faded away. Leaning in, he closed the distance between them,his lips almost brushing hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before they could shae the moment...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp knock echoed from the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah&#39;s polite voice called from the hallway. &#34;Mr.Stewart, your breakfast has been prepared and is waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s senses returned in a rush, and she scrambled to shove Nolan away, diving beneath the covers with her cheeks blazing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her curl up like a startled kitten, Nolan couldn&#39;t help but chuckle softly,finding her bashfulness unexpectedly endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,the pair made their way downstairs, side by side,as if nothing had interrupted the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick was already waiting for them at the dining table,his suit pressed and posture stiff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan took it upon himself to pull out Eleanor&#39;s chair,then claimed the seat right next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his coffee cup, Nolan lounged back with an air of total calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if he were commenting on the weather, he  said, &#34;Erick, go ahead and start planning the engagement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Erick was about to give his report, he froze the moment those words reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Engagement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that really what he heard?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Nolan somehow managed to win over Eleanor without anyone noticing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what about Norwood?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he got even a hint of this, wouldn&#39;t he be furious enough to blow the whole place apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan noticed Erick&lt;&#39;s hesitation and shot him a cool glance. &#34;Is there a problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted out of his daze, Erick straightened up and stammered, &#34;No problem at all, Mr. Stewart! I&#39;ll get on it right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Erick hurried out, the weight of the news propellinghim down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for word of Nolan and Eleanor&#39;s engagement to sweep through Elepdon like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naturally, the news found its way to Lainey. Lainey was seated at her dressing table, carefully choosing which pieces of jewelry to wear the following day, when the news finally reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright, attention-grabbing headline flashed across her phone screen as the news alert came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her triumphant expression vanished in an instant,disbelief spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Norwood promised her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had insisted that she was destined to be Nolan&#39;s bride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could things have changed so quickly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With anger rising, Lainey jumped to her feet and stormed out of the room, determined to confront Jeff and demand the truth.</p>
