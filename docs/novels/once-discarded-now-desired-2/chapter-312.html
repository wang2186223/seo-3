                <p>A few days later, Eleanor saw a Facebook post from Fannie and liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a cheerful camping photo of Nolan, Elora, and Fannie grinning from ear to ear. Nolan and Elora sat close together, while Fannie posed in the background, flashing a peace sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor set her phone aside. She stepped into the backyard to breathe in some air, but the moment was broken by/a call from Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; Lillian&#39;s voice rang with desperate energy. &#34;We&#39;re stuck in a rut. Tonight, we&#39;re getting wasted.Are you in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hesitated, but didn&#39;t say no. Soon, she found herself in a cab, heading for the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, neon lights pulsed across a crowded floor, music thumping in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had arranged for ten male escorts, each impossibly tall and handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lillian spotted Eleanor, she stumbled over, nearly tipping over. &#34;Eleanor! Finally! I&#39;ve been waiting forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mix of alcohol and perfume made Eleanor wrinkle her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clung to her and suddenly burst into exaggerated sobs. &#34;Fraser! That jerk went on another date! What am I supposed to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sighed inwardly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian could have any man she wanted, yet she was obsessed with Eleanor&#39;s distant, infuriating brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guiding Lillian to a seat, Eleanor poured herself a drink. She clinked her glass with Lillian&#39;s and downed it in one go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp liquor burned her throat and dulled her thoughts for a moment. Seeing her boldness, Lillian wiped her eyes and threw back another drink. &#34;I&#39;m going after Fraser. No one&#39;s stopping me!&#34; Her words slurred, her balance wobbly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched Lillian unravel, Eleanor&#39;s mind drifted to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love, she realized, was never as simple asit seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had once been free, untethered, and now they were trapped by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not sure what else to do, Eleanor poured herself another drink and sat back with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, fully drunk now, flailed at the air, muttering, &#34;Fraser....my Fraser... don&#39;t leave me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she slumped back, sobbing. &#34;If you don&#39;t want me, fine! You&#39;ll regret it when I&#39;m with someone else!&#34;Her eyes landed on Eleanor, and a mischievous grin spread across her face. &#34;Babe, dump Nolan! I&#39;ll set you up with a guy who actually has an eight-pack!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could respond, Lillian dragged one of the escorts over and shoved him toward her.&#34;Take care of my best friend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The escort plopped beside Eleanor, flashing a charming smile as he raised his glass. &#34;Drinking alone is boring.Mind if I join?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor said nothing, her expression unreadable as she stared at her glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unnoticed, a few men had recorded a video of Lillian before taking a photo of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, isn&#39;t that Nolan&#39;s girlfriend? Enigma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s that guy with her? They look close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Definitely an escort, wow. If Nolan sees this, that guy&#39;s finished. He has the nerve to flirt with Nolan&#39;s girl.&#34;Excited by the potential drama, the man posted the photo and the video in their Elepdon social circle chat and wandered off, oblivious to the storm he had just stirred.</p>
