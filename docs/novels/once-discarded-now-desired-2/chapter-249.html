                <p>Word of Nolan&#39;s lavish engagement preparations spread quickly, soon reaching the Stewart family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the butler reported the news, Norwood nearly exploded on the spot. His face flushed red, and his chest heaved as though he might lose his breath entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him like that, Wray immediately stepped forward.&#34;Norwood,please, don&#39;t work yourself up. It&#39;s not worth risking your health. I&#39;m sure Nolan isn&#39;t thinking clearly right now. Once he cools down, he&#39;ll come to his senses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood slammed his palm against the armrest with a loud crack. His whole body shook with fury. &#34;Not thinking clearly? That boy is under the spell of that scheming woman!&#34; he bellowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heir he had molded with his own hands,his carefully chosen successor, was pushing against him again and again, all for the sake of a divorced woman.How could he remain calm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned,snarling at the butler, &#34;Go! Drag Nolan back  here at once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler froze, clearly conflicted. After a hesitant bow, he said softly, &#34;Sir, Mr. and Mrs. Benton are waiting outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton couple?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s anger hit a sudden pause, like a flame doused with water. His expression remained dark, but he held himself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their sudden visit could only mean one thing-it had to be about theengagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s silence, he finally muttered in a deep tone, &#34;Let them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeff and Hilda walked into the living room, the atmosphere felt heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood sat straight, his face stormy and unwelcoming. Beside him, Wray appeared composed and obedient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff and Hilda looked at each other, already knowing what they had to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had finally met their long-lost daughter, and since she truly liked Nolan, they couldn&#39;t let her suffer</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Norwood liked it or not, they had to  intervene for her sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the silence, Jeff put on a polite smile.&#34;Norwood, forgive us for showing up unannounced.Since Eleanor and Nolan are about to be engaged, we felt it was only right, as her parents, to come and pay you a visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was warm and respectful, carrying a quiet authority of its own. &#34;The marriage between our families had some issues before, but luckily things are settled now. We know we owe Eleanor a great deal.To make it up to her and show our blessings, we&#39;ve decided to double the value of the wedding gifts we first planned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying this, he pulled out an embossed gift list from his briefcase and passed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler accepted it with care and quickly presented it to Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood took the long list without even bothering to open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear the Bentons valued Eleanor dearly, as the lavish gifts were proof enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to him, it made no difference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Eleanor brought nothing but disgrace. Nolan&#39;s involvement with a divorced woman had already dragged the Stewart family into ridicule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, on top of that disgrace, he wanted to throw a grand engagement party, as if parading their shame for the world to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would never allow his grandson to be dragged down by such a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the thick gift list onto the polished coffee table as though it were nothing more than scrap paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The matter from before was nothing but a misunderstanding,&#34; he said coolly. &#34;Our families never agreed to any engagement. As for Nolan-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cut off with a sharp snort. &#34;He&#39;s young and reckless. I will never approve of this marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s polite smile faltered. His brows knitted together,but for Eleanor&#39;s sake, he forced down the frustration rising inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his mouth to respond, but Norwood had already lifted a hand, signaling he had heard enough.&#34;I&#39;m tired. I&#39;ll rest now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then signaled the butler, &#34;Show our guests out.&#34; At that, Hilda&#39;s stomach sank. Her fingers instinctively curled around her husband&#39;s sleeve,as though clinging for reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gave her hand a gentle pat, his eyes steady as he looked at the old man sitting stubbornly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end,he didn&#39;t argue. He just shared a quiet Look with HHilda before leading her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside, they got into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride was weighed down with silence until Hilda finally couldn&#39;t take it anymore. With worry all over her face, she turned to her husband. &#34;Baby, what are we supposed to do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gently took her hand and said softly, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.Nolan&#39;s a man who stands by the people he loves.He&#39;ll stand by Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Norwood&#39;s harsh refusal wasn&#39;t entirely bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If, in a few days, he still refuses to budge, we&#39;ll take them both back to Breoqua. There, at least,they&#39;ll have us and our family to support them. With us around, no one will dare make them suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were reassuring, yet a knot of unease still lingered in Hilda&#39;s heart. She knew her daughter better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s roots, her love, her dreams, everything was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asking her to leave would be like asking her to tear her heart in two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, though, there didn&#39;t seem to be any other way.</p>
