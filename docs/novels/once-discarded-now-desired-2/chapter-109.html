                <p>Erick only wanted to spit out his report and get outof there. &#34;It was one of the workers hired for the ancient tomb project. He messed with the materials and swapped the support beams for cheap ones, and that&#39;s what caused the collapse. I checked his bank accounts, and there&#39;s a huge deposit in there. It came from the Fist Guild, the gang that runs Zerovia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Fist Guild?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those thugs were Zerovia&#39;s local bullies, but she had never crossed paths with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would they be after her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s thoughts lined up with hers. There was no reason for the Fist Guild to target her unless someone else was pulling the strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed, a sharp coldness flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep digging. I want the truth,&#34; Nolan ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; Erick bobbed his head and practically bolted out of the tent, tripping over his own feet in his hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he had barged in at the wrong time, and the only way to make up for it was to find the person behind this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, the air between Eleanor and Nolan grew heavier, almost charged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s stare was burning with something she couldn&#39;t face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she felt that intensity, Eleanor&#39;s chest tightened.She broke eye contact quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I... I should go check on Dyer,&#34; she muttered, then slipped out of the tent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t stop her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply watched her leave, lifting his hand to brush his lips with his fingertip, as though her taste was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been his first real kiss, and it left him wanting more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow, satisfied smile tugged at his lips until it hardened in the next instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever had dared to target his girl, he would hunt them down and make them regret it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor stepped out of the tent, she almost bumped into Lillian,who looked worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian immediately reached for her, scanning her from head to toe. &#34;Eleanor, are you alright? You&#39;re not hurt, are you? You scared me half to death!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor forced a steady smile, trying not to give anything away. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Really, don&#39;t worry.&#34; Lillian let out a breath of relief, but then her gaze froze on Eleanor&#39;s lips. Her eyes widened in shock.&#34;Eleanor! What happened to your mouth? It&#39;s all red and swollen. Did some insect bite you in there? Oh no, what if it was one of those tomb bugs? Those can be dangerous! You need ointment, quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...&#34; Eleanor parted her lips, but no excuse came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t exactly admit Nolan had kissed her,could she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland, picking up on the situation faster than Lillian,gave a dry cough and stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough fussing. Didn&#39;t the doctor already check her? If something was wrong, it would&#39;ve been handled. Let her rest. Come on, we&#39;ve got other things to take care of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reluctant, Lillian allowed herself to be tugged away by her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she glanced back and shouted, &#34;Don&#39;t brush it off, Eleanor! I&#39;ll have someone send you proper ointment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back inside, Nolan&#39;s face darkened as he overheard every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, when Eleanor entered Dyer&#39;s tent, a doctor had just finished examining him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not in immediate danger,&#34; the doctor explained, &#34;but the situation isn&#39;t ideal. His recovery will take time. It&#39;s lucky he was brought out when he was... any later, and he might not have made it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s expression hardened, and her clear eyes turned sharp and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer was like family to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If people wanted to mess with her, she didn&#39;t care.But dragging him into it was something she couldn&#39;t accept.</p>
