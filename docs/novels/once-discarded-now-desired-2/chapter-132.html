                <p>Lillian hurried after Nolan once they left the Benton family&#39;s estate, flashing him a big thumbs-up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,that was incredible. Eleanor really knew what she was doing when she chose you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan shot her a sideways glance, his expression flat and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say a word, but the tension radiating off him was obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland, quick to catch on, tugged Lillian back before she could ramble on and make things worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan slid into the car by himself, though he didn&#39;t immediately tell the driver where to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t anger holding him back, but it was the thoughts running through his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, he had only noticed that Eleanor and Hilda carried the same kind of presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after he saw Hilda up close at the banquet, the resemblance was unmistakable. They didn&#39;t just feel alike-they looked alike too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had grown up in an orphanage.The Benton family had lost a daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A daring thought began to take shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lifted to Erick in the driver&#39;s seat. His voice was calm but carried weight. &#34;Dig into the Benton couple&#39;s background. And I want every detail about their missing daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick was taken aback. &#34;But Mr. Stewart, hasn&#39;t their daughter already been found?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze flicked up to the rearview mirror, sharp and cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick instantly shut his mouth. &#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Erick quickly corrected, not daring to probe further. &#34;Where would you like to go now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t bother answering. One look was enough, and Erick understood immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the car rolled to a stop in front of Eleanor&#39;s apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression had softened just slightly, and Erick mentally applauded himself for reading the situation right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nolan walked in, Eleanor had just gotten home too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had just washed up and changed into something comfortable. Seeing him there, she looked a little surprised and asked, &#34;What brings you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped inside without hesitation and closed the door behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes settled on her, and in a low voice that carried a hint of teasing complaint, he said, &#34;I was tempted again...but | resisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but laugh at his dramatics.&#34;Congratulations, you passed the test of gentlemanly restraint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan wasn&#39;t after verbal praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned closer, tilting down until his breath brushed against her cheek. His tone was soft, yet full of intent.&#34;Then,what about my reward?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor immediately caught his meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arching a brow, she rose on her toes and brushed a light kiss across his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Nolan forgot to breathe. Up close, her face blurred with the memory of Hilda&#39;s. The resemblance was uncanny, unsettling even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of silence, he finallysaid, &#34;At the banquet, I saw Mrs. Benton. She looks a lot like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor waved it off, casually handing him a bottle of water. &#34;Lillian already mentioned it. But lookalikes aren&#39;t that rare. And the Benton family/isn&#39;t careless. They must have verified everything before accepting Lainey back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice softened, carrying a trace of irony. &#34;When Myah found me, she told me there was a note tucked in my swaddle. It said my parents were gone. So no matter the resemblance, it doesn&#39;t matter.It can&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan studied her quietly, the weight in his gaze unspoken. He didn&#39;t argue. Instead, he hummed a faint acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, in his mind, the possibility lingered. This wasn&#39;t something he could just let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, unwilling to dwell on it, turned toward her study. &#34;Enough of that. I&#39;ve got work. You should head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan leaned against the doorway, unbothered. &#34;Can&#39;t I stay over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spun around, and ushered him out with a calm but absolute′′no.′′</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door locked behind him with a decisive click. Inside, Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed nonstop with orders.Demand for the pills on the Underground Network was surging again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get another batch ready quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money mattered more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men could wait. Orphans depending on her couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, oblivious to her real concerns, didn&#39;t take offense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kiss alone was more than he expected tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He left with a faint smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick caught sight of it in the rearview mirror and nearly choked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really the same cold, ruthless Nolan Stewart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He almost wanted to rub his eyes to make sure he wasn&#39;t seeing things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Erick kept his mouth shut and started the engine, playing the silent chauffeur. But inside, he was groaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Working for Nolan had never been easy, but working for a Nolan smitten with love? Now that was brutal.</p>
