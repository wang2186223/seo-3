                <p>Eleanor could hardly believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had slipped through the noose. With Zerovia citizenship as her shield, she had managed one last cunning escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes followed as court officers dragged Lainey away. She was still screaming, refusing to accept prison. Eleanor&#39;s face remained calm; she was untouched by the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Execution would have been quick, almost merciful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a life behind iron bars was a slower torment. Each passing day would strip Lainey of hope, until despair consumed her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, that fate might be far crueler than death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor turned away and walked toward the courthouse doors. Beside her stood the renowned lawyer.She gave him a polite nod.&#34;Thank you for your effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man pushed his gold-rimmed glasses higher, his tone respectful.&#34;You&#39;re welcome. I only followed Mr.Stewart&#39;s instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bowed his head slightly. &#34;I still have other matters to handle, so I&#39;ll take my leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he blended into the crowd, vanishing with his briefcase in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lingered, scanning the faces around her. She searched instinctively for Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had disappeared the moment the trial ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea where he had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her thoughts wandered, a soft voice called to her, &#34;Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and met Hilda&#39;s gentle eyes, brimming with motherly affection. Jeff stood nearby, his gaze complicated-part guilt, part worry, and a faint hope for forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda stepped closer, reaching for Eleanor&#39;s hand. &#34;Why don&#39;t you come home for dinner tonight? I&#39;ll make everything myself.I already bought the ingredients for your favorite dishes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone carried a trace of caution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced at the hand extended toward her. Almost without thinking, she stepped back, avoiding the touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The movement was slight, yet it struck Hilda and Jeff like a knife to the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Eleanor, their sudden warmth only stirred unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had long grown used to solitude, to carrying her burdens alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Careful kindness now felt heavy, almost foreign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze, she hid her emotions. &#34;Thank you, Mrs. Benton. That&#39;s thoughtful. But I already have plans to eat with Lillian tonight, so I won&#39;t trouble you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady, giving nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned and walked out of the courthouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s hand lingered in the air, her eyes misting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff rushed to steady her, his chest tightening as he watched Eleanor&#39;s figure retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had wounded her too deeply. Over two decades of absence couldn&#39;t be erased in a single night. They had pushed her away themselves, and now reaching for her again was anything but simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside the courthouse, the cold wind cleared Eleanor&#39;s restless thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the stone steps, she pulled out her phone, ready to call Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her finger hovered over the familiar number-then froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far ahead, by the marble pillars, stood two men. One was tall, composed, carrying the quiet authority she knew so well-Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other wore a black baseball cap, brim low to hide his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned slightly forward, his posture edged with provocation, as if taunting Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor started to move toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the man in the cap gave a low laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his head, he revealed sharp brows and a smug smile. His eyes locked on Eleanor before sliding back to Nolan. &#34;Long time no see, my dear brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice was the same one that had exposed Lainey&#39;s nationality in court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan only had one brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So the man was Colson&#39;s illegitimate son-Brodie Stewart.</p>
