                <p>Emma had no idea she was being strung along like a puppet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuming, she stormed into the Enigma store, her heels clicking like gunfire across the polished floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As luck would have it, Eleanor was inside, quietly going over the accounts. Emma wasted no time. She marched straight over and blocked her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; she shouted, her voice trembling with rage. &#34;You shameless bitch! Can&#39;t rely on your own abilities, so you seduce someone else&#39;s husband instead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, utterly baffled by the sudden outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved in the faintest trace of irony as she lifted her gaze to Emma.&#34;Tell me,&#34;she asked mildly,&#34;who do you think is more impressive? Your brother, or Nolan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question caught Emma off guard. She was crazy about Nolan. Of course, she thought he was better than her own brother. But admitting it was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; she sputtered, scrambling for words. &#34;You&#39;re despicable! Whether it&#39;s my brother or Nolan, you&#39;ve lured them in. Otherwise, why on earth would they be drawn to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had met plenty of unreasonable people before, but Emma was in a league of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t decide if she should sigh in helplessness or feel a bit of pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small chuckle, she said in a steady tone, &#34;Use your head before you act. Don&#39;t let yourself get played like a pawn without even noticing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma barely registered the warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What stuck like a thorn was that Eleanor had implied she wasn&#39;t thinking at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her temper snapped. &#34;Don&#39;t be so smug! Nolan isn&#39;t serious about you! A woman like you,raised without proper upbringing, how could he ever seriously want you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult rolled off Eleanor like water off stone. She stayed composed, her voice cool. &#34;And yet, you think Nolan would want you? Security, please see her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point in trading barbs with someone like her. It was simply a waste of energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma balked when two burly security guards began walking over. Her bravado shriveled, and she backed away, muttering, &#34;Just wait! I&#39;ll tell Lainey about this. She&#39;s got more power than you could ever dream of,and she&#39;l put you in your place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that threat, she spun on her heel and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was now the daughter of the Benton family, carrying influence and status that Eleanor couldn&#39;t hope to match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Lainey stepped in, Eleanor wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething,Emma made her way back to the Benton family&#39;s estate, only to be greeted by a maid who, with perfect politeness, told her that Lainey was away at an important event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma didn&#39;t even get a glimpse of her. Left with no choice, she left a message and dragged herself home,her fury dimmed by disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth, however, was very different. Lainey hadn&#39;t gone anywhere. Upstairs in her bedroom, she was sitting ather vanity, flipping through a thick stack of documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was already moving ahead, calculating. She wondered how to talk Jeff into working with the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only with shared business interests could she force Nolan to realize she was perfect for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze landed on one file in particular-the renewable energy project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the future, and whoever controlled it would hold enormous influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t something the Benton family could dominate alone. If they teamed up with the Stewart Group, they could secure a stronghold not just in the country but overseas too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The profits would be staggering, and Nolan would be forced to acknowledge her worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Decision made, Lainey gathered the papers and made her way downstairs. Moving with her usual grace, she settled beside Jeff, who was reading the financial section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,&#34; she began lightly, &#34;I heard from Denny that our first domestic project will focus on renewable energy.I&#39;ve done some research, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something we should handle alone. Have you thought about partnering with the Stewart Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff frowned a little at her words and lowered his newspaper to look at her.&#34;I won&#39;t even consider it. After the way Nolan disrespected me before, that&#39;s out of the question.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, he had admired Nolan&#39;s poise, his ambition, and his capability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the memory of Nolan humiliating his cherished daughter in public had soured every impression.To him now, Nolan was reckless and unworthy.</p>
