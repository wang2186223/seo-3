                <p>Eleanor&#39;s instincts hadn&#39;t failed her-Elora was indeed involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tried to take her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lilah called with the news, Nolan and Fannie had bolted out the door without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now they stood at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah hurried toward them, panic tightening her voice. &#34;You&#39;re finally here. The doctor says Miss Guyton was looking bad. I didn&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora might not bear the Stewart name, but she was practically Nolan&#39;s family, part of her responsibility. If anything happened under her watch, her job was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes turned cold as they fixed on the glowing &#34;Emergency&#34; sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie clutched Lilah&#39;s hand, her face drained of color. &#34;Lilah, how could Elora do this? She seemed fine when I left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah exhaled shakily, her words spilling in guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;After you left, she looked a little off, but I didn&#39;t know what to say. I brushed it aside. When I finished in the kitchen, I realized she&#39;d locked her door. I called, but she never answered. I panicked and grabbed the spare key.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pausing for a moment, she continued, &#34;I found her lying in a pool of blood, unconscious. I dialed 911right away. It&#39;s my fault. I should&#39;ve paid closer attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled with self-blame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Fannie could comfort her,the emergency doors swung open. The doctor stepped out, face grave. &#34;The patient lost significant blood from deep wrist cuts. She&#39;s stable now,but unconscious.Mentally-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced down at the chart. &#34;Her records show depression. As her family, you&#39;ll need to watch h closely. She should see a psychiatrist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a curt nod in gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the doctor walked off, he pulled out his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erick. Find the best psychiatrist in Elepdon. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; came the quick reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the hour, Elora was moved to a VIP ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick soon arrived with a psychiatrist-a refined man in his forties, gold-rimmed glasses perched on h nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted them nervously. &#34;Mr. Stewart, I&#39;m-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Skip it. Get to work.&#34; Nolan&#39;s icy tone cut him short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man-Conroy Morris-swallowed hard and went straight to Elora&#39;s bedside, reviewing her charts silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, he looked up, his face heavy. &#34;Mr. Stewart, her depression is severe. She shows strong sel destructive tendencies and high risk of another attempt. She&#39;ll need strict medication, steady emotion support, and eventually therapy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze softened as it lingered on Elora&#39;s pale face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt the weight of his own neglect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had given her even a fraction of attention all these years, maybe it wouldn&#39;t have come to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hlis voice was steady when he spoke. &#34;She&#39;s yours now, Dr. Morris. Get her through this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pressure in Nolan&#39;s words made Conroy&#39;s throat tighten. &#34;I...I&#39;ll do my best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arrangements in place, Erick hesitated before asking, &#34;Mr. Stewart... What about Miss Warren?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t look away from Elora. &#34;I&#39;ll stay here until she wakes. Go explain things to Eleanor. She&#39;ll understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie nodded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Erick reached the Enigma store, Eleanor was nowhere tobe found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, he sent her a message, explaining the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, unease gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A text for something this big? Somehow, it didn&#39;t feel enough.</p>
