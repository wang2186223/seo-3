                <p>Wray&#39;s smug smile froze mid-face, stiffening until it looked almost painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White family...fourth in Elepdon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, everyone knew the Whites ranked fourth among the city&#39;s wealthiest, but that wasn&#39;t the real problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real problem was Trudy&#39;s mother hailing from the Perry family. It was a powerhouse in Elepdon&#39;s political circle, the kind of influence money alone couldn&#39;t buy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan actually married a White, he might as well pack his bags. There would be no place for him in the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Wray&#39;s chest burn with fury. His hand clenched so tightly around the champagne glass that it nearly shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This! This was even worse than Norwood agreeingto let Nolan marry Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that moment, it hit him that expecting Norwood to completely cut Nolan off, after grooming  him for years as heir, had always been nothing more than a fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the supposed target of Norwood&#39;s scheme,Eleanor,let out a short, cold laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was what this was all about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been wondering why she had been invited to the event tonight. Now it made sense that this was nothing but a setup to embarrass her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tightened his grip on Eleanor&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every eye in the room on them, he guided her toward the stage. His steps were solid, and his presence carried an aura that pressed down on everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing his gaze firmly on Norwood, Nolan declared, &#34;I don&#39;t agree. In this life, the only woman I&#39;ll marry is Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was absolute, leaving no doubt about his resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without offering another glance at those on stage,Nolan turned away,pulling Eleanor along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His actions were sharp and final, making it clear that there was no space for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan!&#34; Fannie&#39;s voice called after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back at Norwood&#39;s thunderous face and the strange woman still standing on stage, then stomped her foot in anger before hurrying after her brother and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grand hall sank into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests exchanged wide-eyed looks, whispers spreadinglike wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t stop talking about the depth of Nolan&#39;s devotion to Eleanor, about his audacity to defy Norwood in front of everyone, even after he got kicked out of the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Trudy, left standing at the center of it all,didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had expected this reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, what mattered wasn&#39;t the rejection tonight but the title she believed would eventually be hers-Nolan&#39;s legal wife. That was the victory she clung to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood,however,was far from composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole frame shook with rage, his finger jabbing in the direction Nolan had stormed off. &#34;How dare he!&#34;His voice cracked under the strain. A divorced woman over Trudy? The thought alone made his blood boil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, in a rush of fury, his vision blurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next second, his body stiffened, and he collapsed backward like a felled tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Norwood!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick,get a doctor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted into chaos, shouts and panic crashing together in a wave of disorder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the quiet of the lounge, after receiving some care, Norwood slowly opened his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy quickly moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Norwood, are you okay?&#34; She held his hand gently and said, &#34;Maybe Nolan was just caught off guard and couldn&#39;t take it in right away. Please don&#39;t be upset with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was hers. She couldn&#39;t risk Norwood&#39;s anger pushing him further away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man studied her gentle face and her reassuring tone, and his shoulders eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With effort,he raised his shaky hand and patted hers.&#34;My dear,you&#39;ve been through so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before themoment could soften further, a voice cut through the air from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Ms. White, I must say, you&#39;re incredibly forgiving. After what Nolan pulled tonight, both our families are left disgraced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie was propped casually against the doorway,arms folded across his chest, a sly grin resting on his face.</p>
