                <p>Two days later, Eleanor told the staff she was ready to leave the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stared at her like she had lost her mind.&#34;That&#39;s absurd. Your injuries were serious. You won&#39;t be fit to walk out of here for at least another month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone, however, left no room for debate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backed into a corner, the doctor tried another approach. &#34;Fine. We&#39;ll let the tests decide. I&#39;ll run a complete examination. If your body meets the standard, you go. If not, you stay put without argument.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the results came in, his jaw nearly hit the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He checked once. He checked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he have misread the data? Injuries that should  have taken weeks, maybe even months, had practically vanished in just a few days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was unreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he failed to understand was that Eleanor wasn&#39;t just any patient. She was the Soul Surgeon, a woman who could pull life back from the edge of the grave.For her, recovery was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For him, it was beyond comprehension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still rubbing his eyes, he admitted defeat. The results were undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A promise was a promise, and he had to sign her dischargepapers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News spread quickly, and Lillian burst into the room as soon as she heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While fussing with Eleanor&#39;s things, she mumbled,&#34;You nearly scared me to death! If something had happened to you, l&#39;d have hunted down that reckless driver myself.&#34; Eleanor let out a quiet laugh, her lips curving at Lillian&#39;s fiery outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her mouth to reassure her friend, but the door swung wide before she could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda and Jeff walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The days of recovery had left Eleanor looking slimmer, her delicate features now carrying an almost breakable fragility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes softened with instant worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had she lost more weight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely she hadn&#39;t been resting properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy stare unsettled Eleanor, stirring an odd mixture of discomfort and yearning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maternal tenderness was something she had never truly known, yet a part of her longed for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s voice cut through the silence, steady and grave. &#34;From what we&#39;ve uncovered, there&#39;s a strong chance you&#39;re the daughter Hilda&#39;s brother lost years  ago. By blood, that makes her your aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke not just to clarify things but to smooth over the tension in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, he had a reason that made sense of the strange bond between Hilda and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he didn&#39;t let the moment linger. &#34;But if you ever bring harm to Lainey again, I won&#39;t forgive you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to his wife, he added curtly, &#34;I&#39;m heading home. Lainey&#39;s probably frightened without me there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the room held only three women.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s fists clenched, her temper flaring. She almost ran after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That insufferable old man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seemed reasonable before, but now it was clear-every word about family was nothing more than an excuse to shield Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda, on the other hand, paid no mind to his harshness. Her resolve did not waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, clasped Eleanor&#39;s cold hand in her own, and tears streamed freely down her cheeks.&#34;Even if he refuses to accept you, I will. In my heart,you are already my child, and no one can take that away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips parted, but no words came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Jeff carried himself told her everything-another DNA test had been done in secret, and the results must have confirmed Lainey was his flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart ached with the weight of unspoken longing, and though every instinct told her to retreat,she couldn&#39;t bring herself to pull her hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her struggle, Lillian shifted her gaze toward the window as if she had noticed something outside.&#34;Eleanor, Nolan&#39;s waiting. We should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctance flickered across Hilda&#39;s face, but she slowly let Eleanor&#39;s hand slip free. Without hesitation, Lillian clasped Eleanor&#39;s wrist and guided her toward the door. The Benton family were an unusual group, each one more peculiar than the next. For Eleanor&#39;s sake, distance was the wisest choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda didn&#39;t call after them. She simply stood rooted to the spot, her eyes following Eleanor until she disappeared from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the test results, she felt no doubt in her soul.That girl was hers. She had to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then there was Lainey, the child who had stolen the life that should have belonged to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The few details Hilda had managed to uncover revealed a disturbing truth-Lainey&#39;s protectors were tied to Zerovia&#39;s criminal underworld.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Eleanor&#39;s safety, she had to hold back for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Jeff, his stubbornness blinded him. If he refused to believe, then let him stay in denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, the truth would break through, and he would regret every word he spoke today.</p>
