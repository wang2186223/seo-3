                <p>Ever since that text, Jonny had been burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t wrap his head around it. Lainey, the woman he once saw as perfect, turned out to be nothing but disgraceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For her, he had thrown Eleanor aside. He had even gotten her a job at the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what had she done? She had been another man&#39;s mistress while overseas, yet came back and acted like she was head over heels for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought nearly choked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed down the stairs, grabbed Lainey off the sofa, and spat, &#34;Lainey, you disgust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t care about Jonny anymore, but being insulted for no reason was something she wouldn&#39;t let slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her hand free, calmly wiped it with a wet tissue, tossed it into the trash, and shot back,&#34;What&#39;s wrong with you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny let out a harsh laugh while mocking her.&#34;Drop the act. I know all about you and Horace Boyd.I&#39;ve seen the photos. Lainey, I&#39;m filing for divorce.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey froze for a second, and her stomach twisted in panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the one part of her past she never wanted anyone to dig up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had really gone behind her back to investigate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But so what if he knew?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she would be recognized as a Benton. Jonny wasn&#39;t worthy of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, her arrogance quickly returned.She lifted her chin and sneered. &#34;Fine, let&#39;s divorce.We&#39;ll settle the papers tomorrow.&#34; Jonny stared at her, completely thrown off. He hadn&#39;t expected her to agree so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then it hit him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, they couldn&#39;t split.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still needed her and the Benton family that stood behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least for now, letting her go was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing his anger, he looked away and forced his tone to ease. &#34;Forget it. I will let that slide.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His weak retreat only made Lainey see right through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he wanted to back out now? Not happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice turned cold as steel. &#34;From tonight, I&#39;ll be staying on the third floor until my parents return. But let me make this clear, this marriage will end.Whether you&#39;re ready or not, it&#39;s only a matter of time.&#34; If it weren&#39;t for her reluctance to face the Gilbert family, she would have left Jonny long ago. Just being near him made her skín crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been waiting for the right moment to say it,and now, he had handed her the chance himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling satisfied, Lainey gathered her things,humming softly under her breath as she moved upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she locked the third-floor door behind her, her phone vibrated with a message from Horace.&#34;Someone&#39;s aggressively digging into the ancient tomb collapse incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one person came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan. If he uncovered her involvement, everything would be over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Benton family still overseas, she couldn&#39;t afford even the smallest mistake. Her pulse steadied as she forced herself to think clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without hesitation, she called Horace. &#34;Listen,if you can clean this up and make sure it never points back to me, I&#39;ll introduce you to the Bentons. I&#39;ll even give you a piece of the Benton Group&#39;s stocks. How does that sound?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s chuckle was slow and calculating. &#34;E&#39;ll do it if you give me five percent of the shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five percent? Lainey&#39;s jaw clenched. That was an outrageous demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton Group wasn&#39;t just a company; it was a titan in Breoqua. Five percent meant tens of billions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was practically robbing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she thought of Nolan&#39;s cold, unrelenting nature, she realized she couldn&#39;t risk pushing her luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money could always be made again, but if Nolan uncovered any evidence against her, prison would be her reality for the rest of her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cornered by the thought, Lainey clenched her jaw and spat out one word. &#34;Deal.&#34;</p>
