                <p>The man froze at the sight of Eleanor, clearly taken aback. For a moment, he just stared before steadying himself.&#34;You must be-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bofore he couldfinish, Jeff appeared with Lainey at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s eyes swept over Eleanor and Nolan with clear disdain, but he ignored themn and turned to Lainey.&#34;Lainey, this is your eldest brother, Fraser.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s expression softened instantly into a timid, pitiful look. &#34;Fraser,&#34;she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice quivered as if weighed down by guilt.&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Fraser. This is all because of me. If it weren&#39;t for me, Mom never would&#39;ve come back to the country. If she hadn&#39;t returned, maybe none of this would&#39;ve happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled as she spoke, her head sinking lower and lower until her expression was hidden. Behind that soft demeanor, though, her thoughts were far darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had believed the medicine would be enough to end Hilda&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hilda somehow had survived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant she had to come up with a new plan,and one that would make sure Hilda never opened her eyes again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then would she truly secure her place as a Benton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser Benton let out a faint frown and answered with a casual &#34;hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes moved to Lainey, yet he felt no real connection with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangely, it was Eleanor who caught his attention right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face looked so much like Hilda&#39;s in her old photos that it stirred a surprising sense of closeness, almost like family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey immediately caught on to where his attention had drifted, and her heart skipped. A prickle of unease shot through her. Quickly, she piped up, &#34;Fraser, no matter what she said, don&#39;t believe her. Mom fell sick right after meeting her yesterday!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s tone was heavy with accusation as he added, &#34;Miss Warren, isn&#39;t that why you came today? Just to check if my wife managed to survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words nearly branded Eleanor a murderer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor didn&#39;t flinch. Meeting his gaze, she spoke evenly. &#34;Mr. Benton, I know you&#39;re worried about your wife, but I won&#39;t admit to something I didn&#39;t do. It&#39;s true, I met Mrs. Benton yesterday. But when the incident happened, I was in the restroom. I don&#39;t know what took place. If you doubt me, check the restaurant&#39;s security footage or report it to the police. Let them investigate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of the police, Lainey&#39;s composure cracked for a spli second, and she quickly grabbed Jeff&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Dad, don&#39;t waste time on her. Right now, Mom&#39;s health comes first. We can deal with this after she wakes up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff scoffed, his tone cold as he looked away. &#34;My daughter knows what&#39;s important. Not like some people who only know how to make excuses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, who had been silent until now, stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He positioned himself in front of Eleanor, his eyes turning sharp, his voice low and cutting.. Benton, I&#39;d advise you to mind your words when speaking to my girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s jaw tightened. He wasn&#39;t the type to back down. &#34;Respect is earned, not handed out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension between them thickened, ready to spark into something bigger. But before it could, Eleanor tugged lightly at Nolan&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Forget it. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let Nolan, with his reputation and standing, get dragged into this because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, with the Benton family standing guard, she couldn&#39;t even get near Hilda, let alone treat her. Just as the two were about to enter the elevator, Jeff&#39;s voice suddenly came from Hilda&#39;s hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, you&#39;re awake! How are you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for a heartbeat. Her steps faltered, yet she forced herself to step inside the elevator without looking back.</p>
