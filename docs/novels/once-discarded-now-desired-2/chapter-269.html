                <p>Trudy parked outside the Stewart family&#39;s estate and quickly fixed her makeup before stepping out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At times like this, staying calm and collected was more important than anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried a chessboard she had carefully picked out for Norwood and walked toward the gates with a smooth, confident step, but Hector stopped her before she could get any closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. White,&#34; Hector said, standing in her way, &#34;this isn&#39;t a good time. Mr. Stewart is taking a nap right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s smile faltered for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nap? It was already two in the afternoon, and Norwood was rarely still at this hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew immediately that this was just an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear he was upset about the White Group&#39;s stock dropping so fast, and on top of that, she had been criticized all over the Internet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing her irritation, Trudy gave Hector a polite smile and turned back toward her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, inside a sleek black Maybach,Wray watched the scene and clicked his tongue softly. &#34;I didn&#39;t realize Eleanor had this much influence. Even Trudy can&#39;t compete with her,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, that presented an opportunity for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had just left the Stewart family&#39;s estate himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood had been so angry over the White Group&#39;s stock tanking that he smashed a costly vase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In business, profit always came first, and alliances came right after. Once the White family lost their value, Norwood could drop them at any time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Wray saw his opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie, leaning lazily in the car, noted the ambition in Wray&#39;s eyes. &#34;The White Group&#39;s stock has hit rock bottom, but the Perry family still counts for something. Consider this an early congrats, Wray.You might just win Trudy&#39;s heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray smoothed his suit and hair, brushed off imaginary dust, and stepped out of the car, standing directly in front of Trudy as she moved to get inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He greeted her with a polite smile. &#34;Ms. White, hi.I&#39;m Wray Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy gave him a brief glance, taking in the man who had replaced Nolan as the head of the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her composure, giving a polite nod as she tried to pass him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Wray wasn&#39;t finished. His voice had an edge to it  as he spoke again. &#34;I just visited Norwood.He was furious after seeing the news about the White Group&#39;s stock crash. And it seems even you were held at the door. Perhaps he&#39;s reconsidering the alliance between our families.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard that, Trudy&#39;s stepscame to an abrupt stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up at Wray in disbelief. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood wanted to call off the engagement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That couldn&#39;t be happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t risk being rejected like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and her family would end up being a joke in town.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray noticed the flash of disbelief in her eyes and knew he had already scored half the battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step closer, adopting a calm, polished smile, trying to appear the perfect gentleman. &#34;I&#39;m  just offering a friendly suggestion,&#34; he said smoothly.&#34;l&#39;ve recently stepped in as CEO of the Stewart Group. Perhaps it&#39;s time to consider another partner.Together, we could make a strong alliance, and surely-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could finish, Trudy&#39;s sharp intuition kicked in. Her expression turned icy, and she cut him off with a sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; she snapped. &#34;Who do you think you are? A distant relative trying to compare yourself to Nolan? If you so much as step out of line, I&#39;ll mnake sure my grandfather handles it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s eyes narrowed as he watched her car pull away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the comparison to Nolan... it burned him more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Nolan have everything handed to him,while  he had to fight tooth and nail for even a little recognition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his jaw, Wray walked back to his car, his face as cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie, noticing the frustration written all over him,let out a mocking whistle. &#34;Looks like she&#39;s not an easy one to impress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That only fueled Wray&#39;s anger more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always the perfect one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, he would even the score.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for Trudy, who did she think she was? As CEO of the Stewart Group, he could have any woman he wanted.</p>
