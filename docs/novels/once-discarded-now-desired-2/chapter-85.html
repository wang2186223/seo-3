                <p>Ryland never expected that the Brooks Group would be the biggest winner out of all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t resist bragging about it. Grabbing his phone, he dialed Nolan. &#34;Nolan, jealous yet?&#34; he teased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short silence before Nolan&#39;s cool,detached voice came through, &#34;That&#39;s all it takes to excite you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of being dampened, Ryland became even more animated.&#34;Oh, admit it.You sound green with envy. Eleanor just dropped a tweet, and our firm&#39;s value shot up by billions. Meanwhile, you&#39;ve been pulling strings behind the scenes nonstop, but what&#39;s to show for it? Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he spoke, the more triumphant he sounded.so much so that he didn&#39;t even notice Nolan&#39;s silence stretching on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he realized his friend&#39;s silence, Ryland quickly softened his tone. &#34;But credit where it&#39;s due, Nolan.You&#39;ve got sharp instincts. The woman you like? She&#39;s extraordinary.&#34; That line finally eased Nolan&#39;s expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, he opened his Facebook and posted one line. &#34;I feel hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at Eleanor&#39;s apartment, Lillian was sprawled on the sofa,scrolling through glowing fan comments with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she saw Nolan&#39;s post, she nearly leapt up.Shoving her phone in Eleanor&#39;s face, she squealed,&#34;Look! Nolan says he&#39;s hurt because of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave the post a glance, her lips twitching faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, Nolan could be so childish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t give me that look!&#34; Lillian laughed, nudging her with her elbow. &#34;Seriously, why don&#39;t you just say yes to him already? Now that everyone knows you&#39;re Enigma, you two are basically the ultimate power couple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor calmly pushed her head aside. &#34;I&#39;ve got no time for romance. I&#39;m busy planning a charity foundation to help orphans across the country.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pouted. &#34;Keep denying it all you want. But if another woman snatches him up, don&#39;t come crying to me.&#34; While Eleanor wasn&#39;t crying, Myah was almost in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Eleanor&#39;s identity came out, Hope House had been overrun by reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Sutton, how did you raise such a genius like Enigma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she always special as a child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you share her childhood story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah had no answers for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Eleanor was just a bright, kindhearted kid and not some mysterious figure wrapped in fanfare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed, she shut the doors and refused to see anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor heard what was happening, she immediately went online and posted, &#34;Please don&#39;t disturb Myah. She&#39;s simply a kindhearted person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fans listened, and within hours, the crowd outside Hope House cleared away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, sharp-eyed followers noticed that Enigma had registered a national orphan foundation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly,her comments flooded with excitement. &#34;I&#39;ll donate right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our idol isn&#39;t just talented, she&#39;s kind too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open the donation channel, I&#39;ll be the first in line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet atmosphere flipped from noisy chaos to celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans cheered as though they had won a battle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lainey watched from the shadows.Seeing her name mentioned less and less should have brought relief, but the truth hit her hard. Eleanor was Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she had seen firsthand just how terrifyingly loyal and passionate Enigma&#39;s fans could be. If they ever turned on her, she knew it would be the end.</p>
