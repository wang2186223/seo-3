                <p>Lainey was in a state of near panic, completely blindsided by the turn of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was,in a way,perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plagiarism scandal had blown over, and to top it off, she had even been mistaken for Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she couldn&#39;t admit it outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who knew when the real Enigma might appear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a weak laugh and protested, &#34;How could that be? You girls really know how to joke around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her ambiguous response, however, said more than her words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scene quickly turned chaotic, with compliments flying everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian arrived, she was utterly entertained by the absurdity unfolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let it get even messier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bigger the drama, the more amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was curious to see how Lainey would handle this in the long run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Lillian looked away and went upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she met Eleanor, emotions naturally ran high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After some polite conversation, Lillian got back to her matchmaking. &#34;Nolan has done a lot for yòu lately.Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time you gave him some thought? He has been a bachelor in his whole life, and he finally got a crush on someone.&#34; Eleanor nearly choked on her coffee, quickly clamping a hand over Lillan&#39;s mouth, °Quiet. The competiion is about to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muffled and wide-eyed, Lilian could only blink and nod, signaling her compfiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey secured first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor raised a brow and pressed the intercom.&#34;Listen up. I won&#39;t be taking on apprentices this year.And second and third place can join the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty froze in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not taking on apprentices at all was one thing, and that rumor had circulated before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But skipping the first-place winner entirely to reward the second and third? That was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she knew better than to question it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Execution came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she relayed Eleanor&#39;s message exactly as it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, who had been reveling in her victory, felt her face darken with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was the point of all her scheming and risks if this was the outcome?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger bubbled up inside her, and she was about to snap when laughter erupted from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma! Your acting is so over the top!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, we all get it already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey paused, confused for a moment, until the word Enigma clicked in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah,they were still caught up in that earlier misunderstanding! A grin spread across her face as an idea struck her. She lifted her hands and formed a heart with her fingers toward the audience. &#34;Love you all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t verbally admit it, but thé gesture spoke volumes and was enough for the crowd to take it as a silent acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was amazing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,they had truly seen the real Enigmá in áction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey stepped off the stage, she was swarmed by reporters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Gilbert, did Besty&#39;s sudden announcement about not accepting apprentices come from your suggestion?&#34; one shouted, with his camera flashing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lainey could answer, her passionate fans jumped in to explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Miss Gilbert is Enigma herself. Who else would make that kind of decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right! Think about it. Why would second and third place get rewards, but not the first? It makes perfect sense now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma probably joined just for fun and didn&#39;t expect things to get so big, so she had to quickly change the rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments; the crowd had pieced together a seamless argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, everyone was convinced that Lainey was undoubtedly Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Lainey simply raised the microphone and said calmly, &#34;No comment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sometimes silence says it all, and today, her words, or lack thereof, were a quiet confession.</p>
