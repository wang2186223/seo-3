                <p>Fraser remained clueless about the secret meeting between Lainey and Millie, who had already come together and settled on a single version of events.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, his phone buzzed with two fresh surveillance clips from Denny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the first video, Millie, dressed in her server uniform, was caught on camera slipping something suspicious into a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second video captured her dashing out of the cafe, clearly frantic, moments before the ambulance pulled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That proved it. Someone had messed with the coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser felt the weight of suspicion grow heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life rarely played out so straightforward-no waitress would risk everything to target his mother, not without a push.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage threatened to send him storming off to find answers, but a glance at his mother, pale and motionless in her hospital bed, anchored him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t just leave her behind and hope nothing else happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only choice was to stay by her side, counting the minutes until his father arrived to relieve him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night crawled by, every hour stretching painfully long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At sunrise, Jeff finally showed up to take over. Fraser wasted no time heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, he shot Jeff astern look. &#34;Don&#39;t let Lainey get anywhere near Mom by herself.I mean it. I&#39;ll fill you in once I&#39;m back.&#34; Jeff couldn&#39;t shake the uneasy feeling in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser&#39;s warning seemed strange, but after the doctor filled him in that his wife might not have made it last night, fear gripped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Lainey had a hand in what happened to Hilda?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. That didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Fraser was just worried that Lainey would freeze up in an emergency, unable to cope if something went wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,that explanation felt safer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he clung to that thought, Jeff&#39;s nerves settled a bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser soon pulled up to Verdant Crest with a small group of bodyguards in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time storming into the kitchen, where Millie was scrubbing dishes. &#34;Tell me the truth. Who put you up to this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie nearly dropped the plate in her hands, her face drained of color. She crumpled, sobbing and begging for mercy.&#34;Mr. Benton, please! I&#39;m begging you! I swear, I didn&#39;t want any part of this! I never meant to hurt anyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Between frantic tears, she repeated the story Lainey had coached her on. &#34;It was a woman, I swear. She paid me and said she&#39;d go after my family if I didn&#39;t do what she asked. I didn&#39;t have a choice-please believe me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm gathered in Fraser&#39;s eyes, his suspicion now all but confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut straight to the point, barely containing his irritation. &#34;Keep going. Did you get a look at this woman&#39;s face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millie&#39;s whole body shook as she put on her act, hesitating for effect. Her gaze darted to the floor. &#34;E.. 1can&#39;t remember very well. She had on a big hat, and there were sunglasses covering her face.&#34; After a moment, she acted as if something suddenly clicked. &#34;But wait! I did hear something.The woman with her, she called her Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Lainey entered the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peeked down at her phone, noticing the fresh audio file with a glint of triumph barely hidden in her smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Armed with this recording, she knew Jeff would be convinced that Eleanor was responsible for Hilda&#39;s incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way to Fraser in a rush.&#34;See? I told you she was behind it! That woman&#39;s always hated me,and she never misses a chance to hurt Mom. Fraser, let&#39;s not wait. We need to call the police now. Mom deserves justice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser&#39;s frowNn deepened, a heavy silence settling over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he doubted Eleanor could ever hurt Hilda, but Millie didn&#39;t have a motive to pin this on her out of thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Fraser wrestled with what to do, Lainey stepped in, her voice smooth and persuasive. &#34;I get that you always want to give people the benefit of the doubt. But Mom deserves better than this-don&#39;t let kindness blind you to the truth. Here&#39;s an idea: instead of calling the cops, why don&#39;t we take Millie and speak to Eleanor face to face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly what Lainey had wanted from the start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She counted on Fraser&#39;s reluctance to drag Eleanor into a police matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the showdown itself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was more than ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Eleanor wouldn&#39;t slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing it for a few seconds, Fraser gave the bodyguards a signal. They moved swiftly, hoisting Millie to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey dropped her gaze, unable to hide a trace of a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory felt close-Eleanor wouldn&#39;t walk away unscathed.</p>
