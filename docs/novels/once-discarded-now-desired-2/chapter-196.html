                <p>Jonny left without a word after being thrown out,making his way back to the Todd family&#39;s house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock hit him the instant he stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room had been turned upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uniformed officers were scattered throughout,carefully itemizing everything in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie sat on the floor with her hair in wild disarray,pounding her fists and wailing. &#34;This is a disaster!They&#39;re taking everything we own! How are we supposed to survive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes landed on Jonny, hopelit up her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to his side, clinging to him desperately.&#34;Jonny, thank goodness you&#39;re home! You have to make them stop!&#34; Before Jonny could even respond, a man in glasses stepped forward, flashed his badge, and handed over a legal notice, his expression hard as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Todd Group has been accused of unfair competition, buried in debt, and is now bankrupt. By law, we&#39;re freezing and seizing every asset in your name-including this property.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny stared straight ahead, refusing to even touch the document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie looked like she might faint, her face growNing ashen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stammered, barely above a whisper, &#34;Bankrupt?That can&#39;t be. The company was stable... How did this happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of suspicion crossed her mind-was this somehow tied to Eleanor or Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had to be the one behind this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman must have pushed Nolan until he tore their family apart. She was ruthless to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie&#39;s thoughts spun wildly, and she grabbed Jonny in desperation. &#34;Jonny, this has Eleanor written all over it. She must have told Nolan to destroy us.You have to go and beg him to stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny tried to form an answer, but no words came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An aged, steady voice cut through the air from the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough! Why are you blaming Eleanor?Everything that happened is because of your son&#39;s choices!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie appeared, moving carefully as someone steadied her down the steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze, then a flicker of relief crossed his face when he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching at hope, he dropped to his knees with a loud thud. &#34;Grandma! I&#39;m begging you! Please help.me. Go to Eleanor and talk to her. Ask her to speak to Nolan and give us one last chance. She&#39;s always respected you. If you stand up for us, she&#39;ll listen!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie&#39;s lips stayed pressed together as her eyes lingered on him. The weight of her disappointment was unmistakable. To her, he was still just as blind and selfish as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her pocket, she pulled out a bank card and pressed it into his hand. &#34;There&#39;s $2 million left on this. It&#39;s everything l&#39;ve saved. Take it and try to rebuild your life. Eleanor doesn&#39;t owe this family another thing. Even if I swallowed my pride and begged her, it wouldn&#39;t change a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most households, that amount would have been enough to live comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Jonny, who had lived in excess for years,the thought of scaling back felt unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers slipped from the card, and his knees gave out as he sank to the floor, his spirit broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret tore through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed the day he ever got tangled up with  Lainey, that snake of a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed himself for letting Eleanor go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But every chance he once had was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing could be undone now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him crumble stirred something in Sallie, but her sympathy wasn&#39;t enough to hold her back. She turned and started up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Age had already stolen much of her strength, and she no longer had the power to rescue the ruined Todd Group or to bring Emma back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light at the top of the staircase stretched her shadow, making her look as though she had aged ten more years in a single night.</p>
