                <p>The instant Eleanor and Lillian left the hotel, the noise of the hall fell away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian spun around, eyes wide with mischief, and all but exclaimed, &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t tell me Nolan just confessed to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor clapped a hand over her friend&#39;s mouth, flustered. &#34;Cut it out! He was only lending me a hand. Don&#39;t make it sound like something it&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand dropped as her expression turned firm. &#34;Honestly, romance is the last thing on my mind. What I want is to keep Hope House running-and maybe even open more so more kids can have a safe place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was her truest priority, the only goal that felt worth chasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian knew Nolan&#39;s reputation well. He wasn&#39;t exactly famous for kindness, which made his behavior toward Eleanor even more puzzling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing how serious Eleanor was, she swallowed her teasing and slipped her arm through her friend&#39;s instead. With a grin, she said, &#34;Fine, I won&#39;t push. If you&#39;re building more orphanages, then I&#39;m all in-money,effort,whatever it takes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then continued, &#34;But you, missy, also need a break. Come on, let&#39;s go. I&#39;m dragging you out for some fun before you bury yourself in work again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s gleaming purple convertible tore down the street, the engine growling until it finally vanished from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nolan and Ryland stepped outside, the air was still heavy with the stench of exhaust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland tipped his sharp jaw upward, clicking his tongue in amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly grin, he bumped his elbow against Nolan. &#34;Well? You&#39;re not going after Eleanor? She sped: off because of you.Perfect chance to explain yourself-and who knows, maybe win her over while you&#39;re at it.&#34; It was true. Nolan had been a breath away from blurting out that he liked Eleanor-far bolder than usual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on the empty stretch of road, unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only after a long silence did he finally shift his gaze back, the corners of his lips curving slightly. &#34;No need.She won&#39;t escape me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland arched a brow, intrigued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence like that didn&#39;t come from nothing-and if Nolan was this certain, then Eleanor was already his in one way or another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s worry turned out to be pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had unfolded today would spark delight for some yet leave others bitter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the rest of the Stewart family caught wind of it, their reactions would be far from simple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to the scandal, Jonny and Lainey&#39;s wedding collapsed into a public farce, whispered about all over Elepdon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey shut herself indoors for days, too humiliated to show her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even worse, Jonny never came home after the wedding night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He vanished completely-ignoring her calls, leaving her messages unread, as though she didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And every bit of it, in Lainey&#39;s mind, was because of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails dug into her palms as she fumed. Why couldn&#39;t she measure up to that woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did everyone jump to Eleanor&#39;s defense?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitch walked around unbothered, even with Hope House on the brink of being forced out. Not a trace of worry showed on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey clenched her teeth. Could Eleanor already have found another location?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No-impossible. Elepdon&#39;s housing prices were outrageous. Even if she did find a land, there was no way she had the money to pay for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s doubts never found answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in their wildest dreams would have believed that Nolan had outright handed Eleanor an entire plot of land.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the truth came out,people would look at her in a very different light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But land wasn&#39;t the only thing he gave away. He gave his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Day after day, Nolan remained at the orphanage, personally supervising the new building as if it were his own project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland finally lost patience. &#34;Nolan, chasing after a woman doesn&#39;t mean you have to tie balloons and run errands like a volunteer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lifted his eyes with a calm that cut like ice. &#34;And that right there explains why your parents keep fretting about your future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland nearly choked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really Nolan-the aloof, untouchable man he had known for years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, alright, I get it,&#34; Ryland muttered, throwing up his hands. &#34;Just don&#39;t blame me if your grandfather blows a fuse when he realizes you&#39;re skipping the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stalked off, shaking his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Nolan rose slowly, his gaze drifting toward the window. Inside, Eleanor was laughing with the children, her warmth filling the room in a way that tightened something deep in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time spent with Eleanor carried a rare ease, a comfort Nolan hadn&#39;t felt in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It gave him a reason to remain by her side without forcing the closeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past few days, she no longer held him at arm&#39;s length. Her guard had eased-not because she trusted him fully, but because he never pressed where she didn&#39;t want him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let her keep her secrets. That alone was enough to let him stay within her circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And once someone crossed into the realm of &#34;friend,&#34; Eleanor treated them with a quiet courtesy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until Hope House finished its relocation, that fragile understanding bound them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s heart fluttered with excitement. Could Eleanor really become her sister-in-law one day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea lit up her imagination, a wish planted deep inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, it remained nothing more than a fragile dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stood before the freshly completed orphanage, satisfaction softening her expression.Extending her hand, she said with quiet formality, &#34;I appreciate your help, Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze dropped to her offered hand, his brows arching with faint amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he clasped it lightly, his voice low. &#34;No need for thanks. I&#39;ve got my own reasons.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor pulled her hand back, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. Instinctively, she asked, &#34;What reasons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glint of satisfaction flickered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning just a little closer, he said in a deliberate drawl, &#34;Because I want to stay near you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as close to a confession as he had ever given.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Eleanor quickly deflected. &#34;Don&#39;t joke like that. Anyway, remember the ribbon-cutting ceremony the day after tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could reply, she turned and hurried off, her retreat almost too quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan watched her go, a slow, knowing smile curving his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, once I decide to pursue you, running won&#39;t save you,&#34; he muttered under his breath.</p>
