                <p>Eleanor found herself standing outside the Hope House gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something held her back from entering, rooting her feet to the spot despite the familiar pull of home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Golden autumn sunlight bathed her as she sank down onto the front steps, wrapped in contemplative silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This orphanage had been her entire world growing up, the only real home she had ever known.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet here she was, feeling like some lost soul too afraid to step through the doors of her one true sanctuary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah stepped outside carrying a trash bag and immediately spotted Eleanor&#39;s unmistakable figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart clenched with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor? What are you doing out here all by yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled from her reverie, Eleanor quickly got to her feet and forced a brittle smile.&#34;Oh,,Myah. I was just passing through the neighborhood and decided to stop by.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bear the thought of making Myah worry about her. &#34;I should probably get going now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah grasped her hand with gentle firmness. &#34;You haven&#39;t had lunch yet, have you? Come inside. There&#39;s your favorite braised beef in the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could protest further, Myah guided her through the familiar doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheerful chatter filled the dining hall as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A steaming plate of rich, aromatic braised beef appeared before Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She merely pushed the food around with her fork, showing no real interest in eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The usual brightness in her eyes had faded to something hollow and distant. Myah watched her carefully before setting down her own utensils with a quiet sigh. &#34;Eleanor, tell me what&#39;s really troubling you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s composure finally cracked, and before she could stop herself, everything came spilling out. The recent events tumbled from her lips, each word carrying a pain she hadn&#39;t fully acknowledged until this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah listened patiently, then offered a gentle smile as she placed another piece of braised beef onto Eleanor&#39;s plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan isn&#39;t just your boyfriend, sweetheart. He&#39;s treated Elora like family. When she faces something this serious, of course he needs to be there for her. Try to see it through his eyes, Eleanor. If someone you considered family was inreal danger, wouldn&#39;t you move heaven and earth to help them? Sometimes we need to step back and understand things from their perspective.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s fork froze halfway to her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she gotten this completely wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet shouldn&#39;t love be pure and uncomplicated, free from all these tangled complications?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elora meant more to him than her, she would end things with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah,who could read Eleanor&#39;s thoughts as easily as an open book, recognized the dangerous spiral beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could voice any objections, Myah pressed a warm food container into her hands. &#34;Bring this to Nolan. He&#39;s practically living at that hospital and likely hasn&#39;t had a proper meal in days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Text messages could carry words, but never the true emotions behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only face-to-face could Eleanor really understand what was in Nolan&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting trapped in her own overthinking was something she did far too easily</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of quiet consideration, Eleanor accepted the container and hailed a taxi to the hospital. She obtained Elora&#39;s room number from the front desk and navigated to the private wing without difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Eleanor lifted her hand to knock, she glimpsed the scene unfolding through the glass door and went completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora,finally conscious,leaned weakly against her pillows looking fragile but alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan occupied the chair beside her bed, his entire face radiating pure relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie practically bounced with excitement. &#34;Elora, thank goodness you&#39;re awake! Nolan and I have been worried sick. Neither of us could manage to eat or sleep properly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of remorse crossed Elora&#39;s delicate features as she looked at Nolan with hesitant eyes. &#34;Nolan,have I become nothing but a burden to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hand moved to rest gently on her head with obvious affection. &#34;Don&#39;t overthink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in his gaze felt completely authentic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie smoothly unpacked a meal container, arranging various dishes with practiced care. &#34;Elora, you must be absolutely famished. I asked Lilah to prepare something gentle for your stomach. Please, eat up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora,clearly starved, reached for her utensils but suddenly noticed Eleanor&#39;s rigid silhouette framed in the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Showing no visible reaction whatsoever, Elora simply looked away, a subtle smile playing at the corners of her mouth before she turned back to Nolan with apparent concern. &#34;Nolan, what about Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s fingers moved through her hair with brotherly affection. &#34;I&#39;ve already sorted everything out with her.She understands the situation perfectly, so there&#39;s nothing for you to stress about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Fannie&#39;s face at those words. &#34;That&#39;s good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the hospital room, the three of them created such a picture of familial warmth with their easy conversation and shared laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt like an intruder witnessing something she had no right to see, a misplaced piece that simply Eleanor felt like an intruder witnessing something she had no right to see, a misplaced piece that simply didn&#39;t fit their perfect puzzle. Silently, she backed away and disappeared down the corridor.</p>
