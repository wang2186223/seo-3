                <p>Lainey had never thought the Faulkner family would crumble so easily. Just a single hit from Nolan, and they were wiped out overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was livid, clenching her phone so tightly her knuckles turned pale. Once again, Eleanor had walked away untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her screen lit up with a new message from the informant she had planted inside the Stewart household. &#34;Nolan was punished by Norwood. He&#39;s been sent to reflect in the basement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s frustration instantly transformed into excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan was being disciplined, then surely it was because of the Faulkners&#39; downfall. And at the core of that matter was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood must already loathe Eleanor, and now he would despise her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lainey seized the chance to stand out now,Norwood might finally acknowledge her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart racing, she rushed downstairs and found Jeff in the study, poring over documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad! Nolan&#39;s being punished by his grandfather,and it&#39;s because of Eleanor! Didn&#39;t yousay you&#39;d help me? The opportunity is right in front of us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother to sugarcoat her words, relying fully on her father&#39;s indulgence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff wasn&#39;t offended in the least. All he saw was the bright spark of determination in his daughter&#39;s eyes.His tone softened as he nodded. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll reach out to Norwood sincerely in the next few days. By his birthday banquet, I&#39;ll make sure your wish comes true.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he had already crafted a plan long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was simply waiting for the right timing.Now,with the stage set, success was only a matter of execution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his reassurance, Lainey&#39;s face lit up with delight.&#34;Really,Dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff smiled warmly, patting her head with fatherly pride. &#34;I would never lie to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, Lainey was a priceless treasure he had gotten back, and he was determined to stand by her no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if she was a little spoiled?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a joyful laugh, Lainey threw herself into his arms. &#34;Dad, you&#39;re the best!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, everything was falling into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon Nolan would be hers, and she couldn&#39;t wait to see how Eleanor would dare challenge her then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the doorway, Hilda stood frozen, having heard everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s girlfriend. It was the third time she had heard Lainey say that name. Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda felt her heart skip for reasons she couldn&#39;t explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing down her unease, she hurried back to her room and quickly dialed Denny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was rushed and urgent as she said, &#34;I need a full background check on Nolan&#39;s girlfriend,Eleanor Warren. Everything you can find. Don&#39;t let Lainey hear a word of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though puzzled, Denny didn&#39;t question her. &#34;Yes,Madam.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was quick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The notification buzzed, and within minutes Hilda had the photos in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tapped them open, and the moment the first one loaded, her whole body went rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on the phone nearly slipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl staring back at her had eyes that curved when she smiled, the faintest hint of dimples, a sharp little nose, and lips that curled just so at the corners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s breath caught. She knew that face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like looking into a mirror from years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in a picture, the resemblance was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In person? It would be impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened as her eyes welled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need a second opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then a bitter thought struck her. Jeff must have seen her before, so why didn&#39;t he recognize her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Jeff stepped into the room, Hilda didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed up, grabbed him by the collar, and stared at him with blazing eyes. &#34;Jeff,&#34; she said, her voice trembling with both fury and heartbreak, &#34;how could you fail to recognize your own daughter? How  could you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger only burned hotter as she thought about the contrast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey walked around like she owned the world,lording her so-called status over everyone, while her real daughter was left out there, struggling. It was unbearable.</p>
