                <p>Half an hour later, news of Sallie&#39;s collapse reached Eleanor. Without hesitation, she raced straight to the hospital, her pulse hammering with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pushed open the door to Sallie&#39;s room, the scene made her pause. Not a single member of the Todd family was present, only the loyal maid and the weary butler kept watch by the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t waste time questioning it. She hurried to the bedside and examined Sallie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tense brow relaxed after a brief examination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie&#39;s condition was weak, but her pulse was stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, her life wasn&#39;t in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, something gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I left her medication with clear instructions. It was supposed to be given on schedule. How could things have deteriorated to the point of a coma?&#34; Eleanor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid&#39;s face drained of color. She wrung her hands before stammering, &#34;It... it was when Mrs.Todd suddenly worsened. At that moment, Miss Gilbert happened to come in,and...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, a sharp voice sliced through the air. &#34;Well, well. Miss Warren.&#34; Lainey swept into the room like she owned it, her lips curling into a poisonous smile. &#34;You&#39;ve divorced Jonny. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s rather improper to meddle in his family matters now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rvalry between the two women crackled in the air. The maid, knowing better than to get caught in the crossfire, quickly slipped away with the butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was left alone with Lainey, Eleanor&#39;s eyes hardened. If Lainey was responsible for Sallie&#39;s hospitalization, then she would make sure Lainey rotted in jail. She gave a cold, dismissive laugh. &#34;If I&#39;m not mistaken, Miss Gilbert, you&#39;re still not part of the Todd family,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barb hit its mark. Lainey&#39;s expression twisted,venom flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t be long before Jonny and I marry,&#34; she spat.&#34;Unlike a slut like you! Who&#39;s spread her legs for countless men. Jonny despises you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice grew louder and harsher, each insult more vicious than the last. &#34;You&#39;re nothing but Sallie&#39;s lapdog. Do us all a favor and leave Elepdon. Stop shamelessly trying to seduce Jonny!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s fury wasn&#39;t without reason. She remembered clearly that Jonny had left home late one night, claiming urgent work at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicious, she had had someone look into it. He hadn&#39;t gone anywhere near the office. Instead, he had gone straight to Eleanor&#39;s neighborhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought burned Lainey alive. It must be this  bitch! She was dragging him back!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, however, didn&#39;t flinch. A soft, mocking laugh escaped her lips as she slowly retrieved her phone from her bag, waving it lightly. &#34;Miss Gilbert,&#34; she said smoothly, &#34;your tongue is certainly sharp. I wonder how Jonny would react if he heard every word of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood drained from Lainey&#39;s face. She recorded it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her composure snapped. With a snarl, she lunged toward Eleanor, clawing for the phone. &#34;You bitch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always been soft-spoken and composed around Jonny. If he heard the recording,her carefully curated image would shatter. No! She couldn&#39;t let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor moved with deadly precision. In an instant, she blocked Lainey&#39;s reach and pushed her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips curved into a cutting smile. &#34;Jonny doesn&#39;t interest me. If he&#39;s your prize, go ahead and take him. But watch your little games-if I find out you had anything to do with Sallie&#39;s coma...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the threat hang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey sank to the floor, completely undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Eleanor already discovered what she had done?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t have known! At the time, it had just been her and the maid, and she had been careful.Eleanor must be bluffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to salvage her composure, Lainey stammered,her eyes flicking nervously, &#34;You&#39;re... you&#39;re making baseless accusations. I don&#39;t know what you mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor&#39;s gaze was unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Lainey was involved in Sallie&#39;s condition, but the exact details remained a mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would need to speak with the maid later to uncover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know exactly what I&#39;m talking about,&#34; Eleanor  retorted, her words slow and deliberate. &#34;And don&#39;t think that just because you&#39;re in the hospital room pretending to help, you can harm Sallie without consequences. There&#39;s surveillance everywhere. One wrong move, and your days of scheming are over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she turned on her heel and left,leaving Lainey seething in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That bitch! Slandering me without proof! I&#39;ll make her pay once I&#39;m Jonny&#39;s wife!&#34; she muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her mind snapped back to the recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach churned. She needed a plan, and fast,before Eleanor could use it against her.</p>
