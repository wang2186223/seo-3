                <p>An empty promise? How amusing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lips curved faintly before he straightened,slipping back into his usual polished composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the glimmer of amusement in his eyes betrayed him. Eleanor frowned slightly. Had she said something wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just about to ask when a sudden ringtone broke the moment,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t her phone-it was Nolan&#39;s. He answered briskly, but as he listened, his calm expression hardened into something far more severe. The shift was so sudden it startled Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping the call to an end, he rose from his chair in one smooth movement. &#34;Sign the agreement.Something urgent came up.&#34; And just like that, he was gone, the door swinging shut behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stared after him, bewildered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could possibly shake someone like Nolan so much? Still, it wasn&#39;t her place to pry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling slowly, she gathered herself, signed the contract, and left the café with the file in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian hadn&#39;t gone far. The moment she spotted Eleanor, she practically bolted over. &#34;So? How did it go? Nolan didn&#39;t look very happy when he left. Don&#39;t tell me the deal collapsed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, not in the mood for a barrage of questions,simply handed her the folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? He really agreed?&#34; Lillian snatched it open,already buzzing with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when her eyes fell on the bold print inside, her jaw nearly dropped to the ground. &#34;No way. Eleanor,am I hallucinating?&#34; Her gaze darted around nervously as she clutched the contract as though afraid someone might snatch it from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor rolled her eyes at her dramatics. &#34;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be from the Brooks family? Try not to look so desperate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian was practically shaking. An entire plot of land worth billions... just given away like it was nothing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even on her eighteenth birthday, her father and brother hadn&#39;t spoiled her with anything close to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Eleanor and Nolan weren&#39;t even... related.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her excitement quickly shifted to suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed Eleanor, dead serious now. &#34;Hold on. You didn&#39;t... sell yourself to him, did you? No way. You&#39;re Enigma. You don&#39;t need to trade yourself for land.Love should be taken slowly, not...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop.&#34; Eleanor cut in before Lillian could run  off with her own ideas. &#34;He didn&#39;t ask me for anything, and l didn&#39;t offer anything. He said it was support for Hope House. That&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She repeated his explanation about Stewart Group&#39;s long-term support for Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, however, wasn&#39;t convinced. She squinted at Eleanor, her expression makingit clear she wasn&#39;t fooled. &#34;Girl, you&#39;ve really gotten yourself into something. Nolan&#39;s clearly into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, what kid of corporate sponsorship involved giving away an entire plot of land?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t come up with a single explanation,other than romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, she didn&#39;t even need to push them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the way Nolan was moving, Eleanor was bound to get caught up in his pace sooner or later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, being with Nolan wasn&#39;t all sunshine. His name alone drew attention, and his admirers weren&#39;t exactly few.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Lillian uneasy, leaving her worried about whether Eleanor could handle the pressure that came with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t indulging in such wild ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Lillian a light tap on the forehead and laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t start weaving your own romance novel. Nolan said it was for charity, so take his word for it. Let&#39;s move on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe Nolan was simply using Hope House as a chance to polish Stewart Group&#39;s public image. It didn&#39;t have to mean more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine, fine.&#34; Lillian pouted, but her playful mood quickly returned. &#34;Anyway, it&#39;s a win! We should celebrate. Come on, drinks are on me!&#34;</p>
