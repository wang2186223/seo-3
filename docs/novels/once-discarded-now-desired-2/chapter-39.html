                <p>By the look on Eleanor&#39;s face, Nolan already knew what was running through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered himself in front of the child and said in a teasing tone, &#34;Sweetheart, thank you for stepping in for me. Otherwise, someone might&#39;ve thought the worst of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor pressed her lips tight and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sharp tongue of his never failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone, carrying their own thoughts, walked Fannie back to the house just as dinner was about to be served.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah had made sure to save them a table while the rest of the seats were already full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fruit had been handed out, Eleanor sat beside Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day had clearly turned against her, since running into him felt like pure bad luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swore she would ask Myah about his visits before showing up next time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, life rarely went the way she planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they ate, Fannie looked at Eleanor with eager eyes. &#34;Eleanor, can I come with you to the orphanage next time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She absolutely adored Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of her poor health since childhood, she had grown up with very few friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as a Stewart, she could always sense disdain behind people&#39;s smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, however, was unlike the rest. Just earlier,she had seen it for herself-those eyes held only kindness,  never judgment. Worried Eleanor might turn her down, Fannie quickly caught her hand and shook it eagerly. &#34;Please,Eleanor.Say yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she met a gazé as puré as a child&#39;s, Eleanor found it hard to turn her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually Eleanor gave in. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan arched his brows, cutting in smoothly.&#34;Fannie, you&#39;re not in the best shape. I&#39;ll come along next time too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes then shifted upward, fastening on Eleanor as if she had suddenly become far too obedient. &#34;You don&#39;t object, do you,Miss Warren?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sounded less like a question and more like a decision already made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Fannie&#39;s sake, Eleanor swallowed her pride and chose to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very idea of seeing Nolan&#39;s cold expression week after week sent prickles across her scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced a stiff smile and replied, &#34;Of course. It would be my privilege to have you join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone, though polite, carried a thin edge of mockery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lips lifted in the faintest smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His long fingers reached for the shared fork, carefully placing a slice of braised beef onto Eleanor&#39;s plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture caught her completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was that supposed to mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A peace offering?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or some kind of test?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, with so many eyes watching, she had no choice but to lower her gaze and quietly eat what was in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food lost its flavor completely. Even so, Eleanor stuck to her disciplined habits, finishing every bite-including the braised beef Nolan had served her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dinner ended, Fannie tugged eagerly at Eleanor&#39;s hand and pulled her outside to the yard, her laughter mingling with that of the other children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheerful voices rang through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the porch, Nolan stood motionless, his eyes following Eleanor and Fannie in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A phone appeared in his hand, and he dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well. Nolan, you actually calling me?&#34; Ryland&#39;s voice drawled with teasing amusement on the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan ignored the banter, his tone cutting straight to the point. &#34;Find out where Eleanor graduated from.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment of silence followed before Ryland spoke again, caught off guard. &#34;That&#39;s all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been expecting something far more dramatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if it came down to gathering information, Nolan couldn&#39;t have asked a better man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need to dig around. I already know the answer,&#34; Ryland responded.</p>
