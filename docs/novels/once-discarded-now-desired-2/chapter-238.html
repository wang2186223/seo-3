                <p>Nolan swung his long leg with precision, kicking Lainey squarely in the stomach</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went flying,crashing hard into a nearby table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests gasped, stepping back in shock at the sudden violence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was quick to move, supporting Hilda as she checked her over. &#34;Are you okay?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff moved forward as well, his eyes scanning both women with concern. Any slip could be disastrous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, from outside the church, the wail of approaching police sirens cut through the tense silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She couldn&#39;t be caught, not now. If she ended up in police custody, everything she had schemed for would collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by sheer survival instinct, she struggled to her feet, ignoring the pain, and bolted toward a chosen escape route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s gaze went icy. With a sharp gesture to the bodyguards behind him, he commanded, &#34;Get her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, several figures lunged forward, pursuing her through the hall and out into the streets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eleanor lifted her head, scanning the crowd. And then her eyes locked with a pair of unreadable,familiar ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped forward, and in front of everyone, he pulled Eleanor into a tight embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grip was strong enough to make her slightly uncomfortable, but she understood that he was terrified of losing her again. As she noticed his tremor, Eleanor&#39;s lips curved into a soft smile. She patted his back gently. &#34;Calm down.I&#39;m fine,see?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he released her, his eyes tracing her face inch by inch before finally settling on her bandaged arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His relief vanished instantly, replaced by sharp concern. &#34;Doctor! Where&#39;s the doctor?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still holding her carefully by the waist, he guided her toward the nearby bench, his movements protective,as though any misstep could spell disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sighed and didn&#39;t fight as Nolan led her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes followed her daughter nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt like if she looked away for even a second, her long-lost daughter might disappear again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood, leaning on his cane, walked slowly forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lifetime of experience hadn&#39;t prepared him for moments like this. Today, for the first time, he found himself played by a young woman like Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Jeff with a soft expression. &#34;Jeff, I&#39;m glad you and your wife are safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff nodded slightly, keeping his calm, professional demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Norwood. Things are hectic here. I&#39;Il have someone escort you to rest. I&#39;ll visit properly another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood nodded slightly, realizing this was the Benton family&#39;s problem and not his place to stay. He quietly followed the servants away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Nolan&#39;s private doctor arrived and began inspecting Eleanor&#39;s arm wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stayed close, his presence commanding, eyes locked on her scorched skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the doctor finally set down his tweezers, he spoke with reassurance. &#34;Mr. Stewart, it&#39;s nothing serious. Just a surface burn, the area is small, and it hasn&#39;t reached the deeper tissues. With proper care and keeping it clean and dry, it will heal quickly without leaving scars.&#34; Nolan finally allowed himself to relax a fraction, though seeing the redness and swelling still made his chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have protected her better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor noticed the tension in his face and found it somewhat amusing. &#34;Really, after what we went through,a little burn is nothing. We made it out alive, didn&#39;t we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the fire, the terror, and the near-death experience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being safe and alive now felt like a miracle, and that was all that mattered to her.</p>
