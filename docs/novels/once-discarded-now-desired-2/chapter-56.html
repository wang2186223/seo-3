                <p>Word of the Soul Surgeon&#39;s upcoming consultation sent waves of excitement throughout the Underground Network.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of hope lit up in the eyes of many influential people struggling with severe illnesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The inbox belonging to Eleanor&#39;s top disciple nearly burst with messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she knew the full story. Eleanor only agreed to this particular case because she felt personally responsible, not for any kind of payment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason, she had to refuse countless requests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how many she rejected, the stream of inquiries never slowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was wish that Eleanor might set aside a little time to make a few rare remedies,just to relieve some of the stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing over the disciple&#39;s string of complaints,Eleanor erased them with a single swipe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she could be everyone&#39;s hero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plate was full, between her work at Hope House and the brand-new Enigma Group, leaving her with hardly any extra minutes in the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once another hectic week had passed, it was time for Fannie&#39;s next round of treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Progress was clear. Fannie had not regained consciousness, but her health was much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worry tugged at Eleanor. If Fannie suddenly woke up,she might not be ready, so she hurried out of the room as soon as the treatment ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might have béen rushing too quickly, as she ended up bumping straight into a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The impact was enough to stop her in her tracks. Heat crept up Eleanor&#39;s cheeks behind her mask,and she stepped back quickly to say, &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching a clear glimpse of the man&#39;s face brought her to a standstill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stood right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he wouldn&#39;t notice who she really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get away fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that idea pushing her, she spun around and made her way quickly toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan narrowed his gaze, sizing up her clothing.Could that actually be the Soul Surgeon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had come straight from the office to check on Fannie&#39;s progress, only to come face-to-face with the Soul Surgeon here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the Soul Surgeon reminded him of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could they be the same person? He dismissed the idea immediately as it sounded ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, he couldn&#39;t help but call out, &#34;Where are you off to,Soul Surgeon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his voice, Eleanor felt her chest tighten, so she lowered her tone. &#34;I can&#39;t tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying anything more, she slipped inside the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quick exit caught Nolan&#39;s eye, and he stood there deep in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly running, Eleanor hurried out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was too close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next time she visited Fannie, she would need to be extra careful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After puulling off her mask and working the tension from her cheeks, Eleanor noticed a call from Lillian lighting up her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, where are you right now? I&#39;ll come get you!&#34; After sharing her location, Eleanor watched as Lillian&#39;s eye-catching purple-red convertible rolled up beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Eleanor settled into the passenger seat,Lillian leaned over and gave her a curious look.&#34;Eleanor, what have you been up to? You look like something rattled you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shifted awkwardly under her friend&#39;s stare and cleared her throat. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. I just left the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising an eyebrow, Lillian looked doubtful but decided not to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started the engine and made a dramatic pout.&#34;Just so you know, I get you for the rest of the day.If you ditch me again, we&#39;re officially done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of guilt hit Eleanor, and she sent Lillian an apologetic glance. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lillian. Things have been kind of overwhelming lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After studying Eleanor&#39;s tired expression, Lillian let out a sigh and softened her tone. &#34;Okay, since you&#39;ve been running yourself ragged, I&#39;ll let it slide this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their conversation drifted to lighter topics, and soon Lillian brought up some gossip. &#34;Oh, before | forget,did you know Lainey and Jonny finally set a wedding date? They picked the 18th of next month. Lainey&#39;s father has even tossed in $100 million as a wedding gift!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave a distracted nod, her mind wandering elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Eleanor&#39;s lack of reaction, Lillian finally relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor could hear that news without flinching,then maybe she really had let go of that jerk. Feeling relieved, Lillian pressed her foot down. &#34;Hang on tight, babe. We&#39;re about to have the time of our lives!&#34;</p>
