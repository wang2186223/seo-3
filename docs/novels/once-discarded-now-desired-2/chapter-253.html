                <p>Eleanor emerged from the bathroom with freshly washed hair,droplets still clinging to the damp strands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone screen illuminated with an incoming message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The text came from Fannie, reading, &#34;Tomorrow is Nolan&#39;s birthday!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze mid-motion while toweling her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s birthday? She had had absolutely no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse quickened, stirred by an unexpected flutter of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor rapidly typed her response, &#34;Really? Why hasn&#39;t he ever mentioned it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s reply appeared almost immediately,accompanied by a cheerful emoji. &#34;You know Nolan -he&#39;s impossibly reserved and distant! He never acknowledges his birthday. What if we planned something special to surprise him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Considering the day&#39;s earlier events, Eleanor readily  agreed, responding, &#34;Sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two continued exchanging messages at lightning speed,solidifying their arrangements within minutes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning in the dining room, Eleanor finished her final spoonful of oatmeal and placed her utensils aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Casting a glance at the man dining with refined precision across from her,she mentioned casually, &#34;I&#39;m heading to Hope House today. Fannie and I arranged to volunteer together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she rose swiftly and departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s grip on his silverware tightened imperceptibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked his birthday, and he had quietly hoped she might spend the entire day by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his disappointment, he chose not to interfere,understanding her unwavering dedication to her charitable commitments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As evening shadows lengthened, Eleanor remained absent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s brow furrowed as he prepared to call her,when Fannie&#39;s urgent call interrupted first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan! Something awful has happened! Eleanor  collapsed!&#34; Fannie&#39;s voice carried pure panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Nolan&#39;s world went completely silent,as though time itself had frozen and ice had replaced the blood in his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without even properly checking the address Fannie transmitted, he seized his car keys and bolted from the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What normally required thirty minutes of driving was accomplished in ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Lumina Hotel, Nolan located the room number Fannie had provided. The door stood slightly open,revealing only impenetrable darkness beyond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed forward, pushing the door wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that precise moment, gentle light bloomned within the shadows, accompanied by a clear, melodic voice singing, &#34;Happy birthday to you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and Fannie emerged from the darkness,bearing a cake adorned with flickering candles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the room&#39;s lights blazed to life suddenly,revealing colorful balloons and flowing ribbons decorating every corner, transforming the space into something wonderfully festive and inviting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s frayed nerves finally began to settle as he  absorbed the scene surrounding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crushing wave of terror dissolved into gentle warmth spreading through his entire body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor set the cake carefully on the coffee table and offered him a mischievous wink. &#34;Happy birthday. Let me grab some plates so we can enjoy this together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she disappeared toward the storage area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s attention shifted to Fannie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s heart lurched at the expression he directed her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She recognized that particular look far too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan appeared poised to return her favor with a swift dismissal!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick, who had arrived moments earlier,immediately understood the dynamics at play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward smoothly, offering Fannie a courteous smile as he suggested, &#34;Miss Stewart,the evening grows late.Would you allow me to escort you home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could voice any objections, he efficiently  guided the protesting and resistant Fannie toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor returned carrying a box of cake plates, only to discover Nolan standing alone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did Fannie go?&#34; she asked with obvious confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had already moved closer to Eleanor, smoothly accepting the plates from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She mentioned feeling sleepy, so l arranged for Erick to see her home safely,&#34; he explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s puzzlement deepened. &#34;Sleepy? The sun hasn&#39;t even set yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan captured her hand, guiding her toward the waiting cake while his voice dropped to intimate,gentle tones. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about her. Let&#39;s focus on the candles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though still perplexed, Eleanor chose not to pursue the matter further, assuming Fannie had departed due to some unexpected obligation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan clasped her hand firmly, closing his eyes beneath the gentle candlelight, and whispered a heartfelt wish-that every year, every day ahead,she would remain beside him always. Eleanor studied his profile, made tender by the flickering glow, and quietly ventured, &#34;Our relationship doesn&#39;t appear to have others&#39; approval. Do you ever have second thoughts?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This question had been weighing on her mind for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes opened, his gaze penetrating and steady as it found hers. &#34;I do regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt her heart sink slightly at his admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in the next breath, Nolan continued with earnest deliberation, &#34;I regret not finding you sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt completely breathless, delicious warmth blooming in the deepest corners of her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising onto her toes, she pressed a tender kiss to his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes grew darker as he closed them,responding to her kiss with fervent passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Eleanor finally embracing him without reservation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognizing this shift, Nolan slowly intensified their connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They parted only when breathing became necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Foreheads touching, they shared the same air between Findi...them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond the windows, sunset painted the sky in molten gold, merging flawlessly with the evening clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They remained wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, silently watching the sun disappear beneath the horizon amid the twilight&#39;s embrace, for what felt like an eternity.</p>
