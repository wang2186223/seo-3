                <p>Eleanor hadn&#39;t expected that she would end up standing Lillian up once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before she was about to head to the Benton family&#39;s party, a call came through with news that Sallie was in critical condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Eleanor no longer owed the Todd family anything, she could never ignore Sallie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman had once been warm and kind to her. That debt was one she couldn&#39;t forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a short sigh, Eleanor typed out a quick message to Lillian, saying, &#34;Sorry, something urgent came up.I can&#39;t make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without waiting for a reply, she flagged down a cab and rushed straight to the Todd family&#39;sestate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house was unnervingly quiet when she arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single Todd family member in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was Lainey&#39;s grand recognition banquet, so everyone would be busy fawning over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That suited Eleanor just fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fewer questions, fewer complications.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped into Sallie&#39;s room, where several maids stood crowding the bedside. &#34;Leave us. I&#39;ll handle it from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The women exchanged looks, but knowing how generous Eleanor had always been, they obeyed and filed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor pulled a chair to the bedside and carefully examined Sallie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse was weak, her breathing faint, and her body so frail it was almost translucent. Eleanor&#39;s chest tightened. Sallie&#39;s heart was failing, and the anger she had recently suffered had pushed her to the brink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could guess the source of that fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny. Or Lainey. Likely both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was Todd&#39;s family business. She had no place in their quarrels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was fulfill her duty as a doctor, and give Sallie more time, however little that might be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet breath, she pulled her special kit from her bag and set to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, the treatment was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tidied her tools and stepped out into the crisp evening air, only to nearly collide with someone at the entrance.It was Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been sulking ever since Lainey ordered him to stay awayfrom the banquet. But the moment he spotted Eleanor, his simmering anger twisted into something darker, more possessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lit up with a dangerous gleam. &#34;So that&#39;s it,&#34; he sneered. &#34;You knew everyone would be gone, so you came here to find me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guess she couldn&#39;t live without him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes roamed over her with unrestrained arrogance. &#34;Come on, let&#39;s go upstairs. The banquet won&#39;t be over for hours. We&#39;ll have plenty of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for her, already imagining her giving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor shifted just enough that his hand sliced through empty air. Her voice was ice. &#34;Scram.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her rejection made his blood boil. He clenched his fists, fury twisting his features. &#34;Oh, come on. You came here yourself, now stop acting so pure! I&#39;m telling you, Eleanor, don&#39;t reject a good thing and regret it later!Nolan&#39;s not here to protect you today. No one is. And I will have you, whether you want it or not!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he lunged straight at her. Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey hadn&#39;t let him touch her in weeks, and he didn&#39;t dare find another woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHis restraint had worn thin, and he was determined to take Eleanor by force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he seemed to have forgotten that Eleanor, after the divorce, was no longer the docile woman he once knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand flicked with precise speed, and in an instant, needles slipped into his body at vital points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze on the spot, his limbs refusing to obey him. Shock spread across his face. &#34;What? What did you do? Some kind of trick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years of marriage, and he had never known she possessed such terrifying skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t bother explaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retrieved her needles with practiced calm and turned away, not sparing him another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember this, Jonny. Next time you see me, walk the other way. Or you&#39;ll end up exactly like this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another look, she walked past him, leaving him paralyzed and seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn you, Eleanor!&#34; Jonny roared after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled to the ground, helpless fury burning in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That woman, once obsessed with him, was now colder than a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Lainey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even let him attend the banquet, claiming the Bentons would disapprove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, she was embarrassed by him, thinking he wasn&#39;t worthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride writhed in humiliation. He was Jonny Todd, the CEO of a listed company! Maybe not Nolan, but still a man of status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared they look down on him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, he swore under his breath. Someday, both women would crawl back to him. He would make them pay, make them beg, and restore his dignity as a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the paralysis finally wore off, he dragged himself into the house, only to learn the truth that Eleanor hadn&#39;t come looking for him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come to visit Sallie, who miraculously stabilized after her departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny clenched his fists, remembering the precision of those needles and the calm confidence in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was Eleanor,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else was she hiding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he shoved the thought away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she would always be his woman, someone he could discard at will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold light flashed in his eyes as he pulled out his phone. &#34;Did you get what I asked for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man on the other end let out a lazy chuckle. &#34;Rare stuff like that doesn&#39;t just fall into your lap. Be patient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny exhaled, seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then calmed down. He had time. For now, he would keep Lainey appeased. But soon... soon, Eleanor would learn exactly what it meant to be under his control.</p>
