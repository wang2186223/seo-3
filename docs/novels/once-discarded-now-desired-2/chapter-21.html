                <p>Emma dropped her gaze, her lips pressed tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of bowing her head to Eleanor-an orphan raised in obscurity-burned hotter than fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was from the influential Todd family. If she actually apologized in front of this crowd, her reputation in the socialite circle would be obliterated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Death itself felt kinder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts spun wildly, scrambling for escape.Then, in a sudden act of desperation, her knees buckled and she let herself collapse backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor had seen it coming. She shifted a single step aside, and let Emma fall without interference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body smacked the cold marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps broke through the silence. The crowd stared,stunned by the spectacle. Eleanor&#39;s lashes lowered, her eyes cool as she took in Emma&#39;s trembling lashes and the faint, deliberate flutter of breath. A smirk tugged at her lips-such a cheap little trick, so predictable it was almost boring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the staff member frozen nearby, she spoke evenly, her tone edged with authority. &#34;Emma was quite clear earlier-she promised to cover every minor expense for today&#39;s gala. Don&#39;t just stand there. Start drafting the invoices. Our guests shouldn&#39;t have to wait on the Todd family&#39;s generosity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member, rattled by the string of commotions, didn&#39;t dare delay another second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, ma&#39;am!&#34; he replied, hurrying off to begin tallying invoices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several minor families, who had scraped their way into the event through favors and connections,could hardly contain their excitement. They darted eagerly toward the displays, searching for pieces priced under a hundred thousand, grinning as if they had just struck gold. Meanwhile, Emma lay sprawled on the icy marble,feigning her swoon. But Eleanor&#39;s pointed words cut so deep she nearly fainted for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fists clenched so hard that her nails pierced her own skin, sharp pain barely containing the rage boiling inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared Eleanor humiliate her like this in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would make sure Eleanor paid dearly-she would see to it that Eleanor&#39;s life turned into a waking nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the crowd, Jonny&#39;s conflicted eyes lingered on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bathed in the glow of the chandeliers, she stood poised and serene, her calm elegance radiating like light itself. Her presence drew every gaze,leaving onlookers momentarily breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had she become this striking? No-&#34;striking&#34; wasn&#39;t even the right word. It was something more,something intangible, an aura that couldn&#39;t be denied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s chest tightened. Was this truly the same Eleanor who once cowered, docile and submissive under his shadow?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And how in the world had she learned to analyze ancient paintings with such precision?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had grown up in obscurity, without access to teachers or resources.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convincing himself, Jonny scoffed inwardly. This must have been nothing more than blind luck-an accidental flash of insight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had to be it. Clinging to that thought, he forced himself to relax.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the hall, Nolan&#39;s eyes followed Eleanor with quiet intensity. His lips curved faintly, the ghost o a smirk tugging at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman-such a sly little thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she played at innocence, she looked soft,almost harmless. But the moment her real edge surfaced, she became something else entirely-clever, sharp, almost dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contrast only made her more compelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she had sensed his gaze, Eleanor&#39;s eyes shifted toward Nolan and collided directly with his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant, the world seemed to still. Her pulse stumbled, beating wildly as though it might burst through her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept into her cheeks, and she tore her gaze away, flustered, as if his stare had stripped her bare in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look from him carried a weight that made breathing difficult. The fleeting moment passed, swallowed by the hum of the exhibition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the event wound to a smooth close without further incident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, in the quiet of the VIP lounge, Nolan pressed his fingers to his temples, his eyes narrowing slightly as he shifted his focus to Ryland. &#34;Have you found anything on the Soul Surgeon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s brow tightened, his expression shadowed by unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I ran a covert sweep,&#34; he responded slowly. &#34;On the surface, nothing stands out. But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words faltered, caught between caution and duty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tilted his head, his gaze steady, his tone calm yet carrying command. &#34;Finish what you started.&#34;</p>
