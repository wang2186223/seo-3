                <p>The next morning, as thefirst light spread across the sky,Eleanor quietly packed a small suitcase and left the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stood there, watching her car fade into the mist until it vanished from sight. Only then did he turn around and head for the Stewart family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the dining room, Norwood and Trudy were sharing breakfast. Their conversation flowed easily,almost like a picture of a warm family morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, that warm scene lasted only until Nolan stepped into the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he appeared, the laughter died, replaced by an awkward silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood slowly raised his eyes to meet Nolan&#39;s. A bitter chuckle slipped out as he tapped his spoon against the plate, the sharp sound breaking the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what a rare sight. Did you come just to check whether I&#39;m still alive?&#34; he said with open sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy immediately set down her fork and knife,  interjected in a gentle tone. &#34;Norwood, don&#39;t say that.Nolan cares about you, I&#39;m sure of it. Otherwise,why would he come back so early this morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood only snorted in response. He knew his grandson far too well to believe such words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan never showed up without a reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood rose with a stern expression, striking his cane hard against the floor. &#34;You, come with me to the study!&#34; he commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and headed upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t move right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he crossed the room to where Trudy sat, his eyes steady on her. &#34;Miss White, let me be clear-l won&#39;t marry you. If your family is forcing you into this,I can help arrange another marriage for you, one even better than tying yourself to OUR family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy hadn&#39;t expected him to be so direct. His words cut straight through her, leaving a sting in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had cared for him since they were children,always dreaming of being his wife, and she had chosen this path willingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing down the ache in her heart, she lowered her voice, speaking softly. &#34;Nolan, I know your feelings aren&#39;t with me right now, and that your heart belongs to Miss Warren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up and locked eyes with him. &#34;But that doesn&#39;t matter. I want to marry you anyway, to stand by your side as your wife. I&#39;ll wait for you, no matter how long it takes, until you&#39;re willing to look my way again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered herself completely, but Nolan&#39;s face didn&#39;t shift in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she had already decided to wait, he saw no reason to waste more words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he turned and strode upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the study, Norwood was standing by the window,looking stern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally turned, his eyes burned with restrained fury. &#34;Kneel!&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan dropped down without a second thought, but his back stayed stiff, his spine straight as a rod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood grew even angrier at his grandson&#39;s unbending stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice thundered through the room. &#34;Look at what you&#39;ve become! Have you completely lost your senses? Trudy is an excellent girl, yet you ignore her  for Eleanor, a divorced woman! If you&#39;re so attached to Eleanor, then keep her out of sight,away from this family. Did you not hear what Trudy said? She&#39;s cool with it. But when it comes to your wife, the one who stands at your side, it must be Trudy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s tone left no room for doubt. There was simply no way he would allow Nolan to throw away the Stewart family&#39;s golden alliance with the Whites and the powerful Perry family just for one woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, however, was unmoved. His eyes held that same stubborn fire. &#34;Grandpa, if the White family alliance means that much,then let Wray marry her.He fits your plan well enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell silent in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood looked at Nolan in shock, then lifted his cane and brought it down hard across Nolan&#39;s back.&#34;How dare you!&#34; he roared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the idea of letting Wray, a distant relative,marry Trudy and gain access to the Perry family&#39;s influence was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of move would shake the very foundation of the Stewart family&#39;s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood looked at the grandson he had placed all his hopes on, and his heart sank under the weight of disappointment. After a long pause, his voice came again, this time hoarse with fatigue. &#34;I&#39;ll ask you one last time. Will you marry Trudy or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lowered his head and said nothing. His silence spoke louder than words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Norwood saw the unyielding look in Nolan&#39;s eyes,anger surged so strongly that he felt lightheaded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled back and had to brace himself against the desk to keep from falling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just refuse to listen, don&#39;t you?&#34; he said coldly.&#34;Fine. Go to the basement, receive the punishment,and kneel there until I say otherwise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t argue. Without a word, he rose to his feet and walked out of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he left, Norwood&#39;s temper exploded. He swept everything off the desk in a fit of rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Nolan lost his mind? Whose blood did he carry to be this defiant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stubbornness was enough to drive himmad.</p>
