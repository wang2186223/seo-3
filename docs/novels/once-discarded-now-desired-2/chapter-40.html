                <p>Ryland spoke with obvious pride. &#34;Eleanor used to share a dorm with Lillian in college. They both mnajored in finance at Northbridge University. But Lillian always said Eleanor was different-she even took clinical medicine as a minor. A total genius! Honestly, her kids are going to have some top-tier genes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That final line carried more weight than casual praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s family name might not be impressive, but if Nolan was serious about her, it wasn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility. After all, wealthy families had never been strangers to illegitimate heirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended without warning, cut off cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland blinked at his screen,baffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Nolan actually just hang up on him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Infuriating,even.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan-the one being cursed in silence-let a sharp gleam flash in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two degrees, one in finance and one in clinical medicine, both from Northbridge University. With credentials like that, Eleanor&#39;s display of skill earlier suddenly made perfect sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nolan couldn&#39;t shake the sense that something about her didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter. Time had a way of revealing secrets, and sooner or later Eleanor&#39;s little secrets would show themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he entertained those thoughts, Eleanor busied herself with the children, helping clear the table before bidding Myah a warm goodbye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie quickly followed after her, worry written all over her face. &#34;Eleanor, it&#39;s already so late. Why don&#39;t my brother and I drop you off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That offer sounded far too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More time around NVolan meant risking exposure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet hailing a taxi in this neighborhood at night was nearly impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing her options, Eleanor slipped into the car at last. &#34;I appreciate it, Fannie-and you as well, Mr.Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t bother responding. He simply leaned back, eyes shut, as though none of it concerned him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped out gracefully and gave a polite wave. &#34;Thanks for the ride. Take care on the road.Goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Eleanor turned and disappeared into the residential complex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Nolan open his eyes, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it feel like she was running from him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tsk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he watched her, the more secrets seemed to pile up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front seat, Erick suddenly blurted out, pointing toward the roadside, &#34;Mr. Stewart, isn&#39;t that Mr.Todd&#39;s car? What&#39;s it doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan followed the direction of his hand and spotted Jonny&#39;s vehicle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sat idly beneath a tree, angled just enough to block part of the emergency lane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back against his seat, Nolan spoke with cool detachment. &#34;Take a picture and report it to the polic &#34;Understood, Mr. Stewart,&#34; Erick replied at once, pulling out his phone to snap a photo as evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan reached over and ruffled Fannie&#39;s hair with unusual gentleness. &#34;Fannie, we always follow traffic rules,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wide eyes blinked up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,he almost seemed playful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but like this side of him-it made him feel more human.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where Jonny&#39;s car was parked, Jonny himself was bound to be close by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Eleanor was about to head upstairs, he stepped in front of her, blocking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she looked up at him, voice laced with mockery. &#34;Step aside, Jonny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of snapping back, Jonny crushed his cigarette underfoot and leaned closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp scent of smoke mixed with his familiar cold aura, wrapping around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bought a villa in the city,&#34; he said flatly. &#34;You&#39;ll move in tomorrow. I admit I was wrong before-l ignored your feelings. From now on, I&#39;ll give you three days of my week.&#34; With that, he tossed his hair back from his forehead, as if the gesture might impress her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor just stared, then lifted her hand and smacked him. &#34;How&#39;s that for clarity? Awake now?&#34;</p>
