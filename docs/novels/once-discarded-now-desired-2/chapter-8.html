                <p>Ryland raised his brows in shock. &#34;Nolan, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually serious about Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could deny Eleanor&#39;s beauty, but Nolan was never short of women to choose from. Why waste his time on someone already divorced?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan avoided giving a straight answer and instead asked, &#34;Do you remember the woman I mentioned-the one who gambled against me over the Usepsall project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I forget? Wait... you mean it was her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly.&#34; Nolan set his glass down with a faint curl at the corner of his mouth. &#34;She&#39;s clever and knows how to hide her true self.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland let out a low whistle, intrigued by the revelation  In all his years, Nolan had suffered defeat only once,and that defeat had come from Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate, it seemed, had a cruel sense of humor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about Fannie? Any progress with the Soul Surgeon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment those words left his lips, Nolan&#39;s expression hardened. &#34;Word is, the Soul Surgeon has an obsession with antiques. In two weeks, David Gill will host an exclusive exchange. If luck favors us, we might find her there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland exhaled heavily. &#34;Then that&#39;s our only option.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian didn&#39;t escort Eleanor back to her villa until it was past midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning light had barely touched the curtains when Eleanor&#39;s phone rang with a call from the Todd family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie, Jonny&#39;s grandmother, was shocked when she learned about the divorce. She wanted Eleanor to join the family for a meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the three years Eleanor had been married, Sallie had shown her genuine affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the divorce, Eleanor couldn&#39;t bring herself to disappoint the old woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By five o&#39;clock, she stepped into the Todd family&#39;s residence right on time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie Todd, Jonny&#39;s mother, looked her up and down with disdain. &#34;So Emma was right after all. That whole image of you being a proper wife was nothing but an act. Underneath, you&#39;re just a seductress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough, Vickie! I invited her here to share a meal, not to listen to your insults!&#34; Sallie snapped,her tone sharp with disapproval. She waved Eleanor closer. &#34;Come here,dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor settled beside Sallie, who greeted her with a smile full of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear, you&#39;ve gotten thinner again in just a few days. Still, you look wonderful today. That lively style suits you. Young people should shine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Sallie.&#34; Eleanor studied her closely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>you still drinking the herbal concoction I prepared for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I have, and it&#39;s worked wonders. I finally sleep without trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie gave a derisive laugh. &#34;As if a country girl could treat insomnia. She might have slipped sleeping pills in the concoction. Of course anyone would sleep after that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie snapped, her voice sharp, &#34;Enough! Don&#39;t belittle her like that. Eleanor gave three years of her life to this family. When your son was broken and helpless, she nursed him with devotion no one else could match. Women like her are rare treasures!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie&#39;s face twisted, but she had no words left to throw back. Bitterness burned in her chest as she kept quiet. &#34;Don&#39;t lether sharp words trouble you. To me, you will always be the true granddaughter-in-law of this family. None of those shameless women outside will ever take your place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma, that&#39;s unfair!&#34; Jonny&#39;s voice rang out as he entered with Lainey clinging to his arm. &#34;The only woman I&#39;ve ever loved is Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what of it?&#34; Sallie&#39;s glare landed on Lainey like a blow. &#34;When you were laid up in bed, she couldn&#39;t stomach the sight of you crippled and fled overseas without hesitation. What love is there in a woman who abandons so easily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s lips trembled, and tears rimmed her eyes.&#34;Sallie, you don&#39;t understand. My family forced me to leave back then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your excuses on me. You might fool Jonny, but you&#39;ll never fool me. I can see who you really are, crysal clear.&#34; Sallie&#39;s frail body shook from the effort of her outburst, and soon she was coughing violently. Eleanor immediately reached over and patted her back. &#34;Sallie, don&#39;t push yourself too hard. Please stay calm, for your own sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her breathing finally steadied, Sallie clasped Eleanor&#39;s hand with affection. &#34;My dear, rest assured. As long as I live, no one in this house will dare mistreat you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude welled in Eleanor&#39;s chest, yet she had no wish to keep hiding behind Sallie&#39;s protection. &#34;Sallie,I was the one who asked for the divorce. I was done with a marriage that existed in name only. My feelings for Jonny are gone, and dragging it on any further would only be torture for us both.&#34;</p>
