                <p>The auction venue buzzed behind Eleanor as she politely declined her team&#39;s dinner invitation, choosing instead to return to the Benton family&#39;s home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp brakes squealed as a car lurched to a stop mere feet from where she stood at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan exploded from the driver&#39;s seat, panic and remorse warring across his face. &#34;Baby, forgive me for breaking my promise. Elora&#39;s violent ex-boyfriend ambushed her at the hospital and tried to assault her.I couldn&#39;t abandon her in that state, so the auction became impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Eleanor recognized this tired dance all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single time she arranged plans with Nolan, some crisis involving Elora would magically materialize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cool indifference masked her features as she inquired with deceptive calm, &#34;Was he caught?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan decided to be completely honest with her. &#34;No, he was gone by the time I got there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that answer, Eleanor&#39;s expression shifted into something like amusement. Looking directly into his eyes,she asked, &#34;Did it ever occur to you that this might not be what it appears?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stared at her in complete shock. &#34;You&#39;re saying Elora planned this herself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea seemed completely crazy to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor had confirmed that Elora was genuinely terrified and showing real physical signs of trauma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could fake something that convincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could tell he would never believe her, so she didn&#39;t waste her breath trying to convince him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze moved past him to her parents, who had just stepped outside. &#34;Mom, Dad, I&#39;m exhausted. Would you mind showing our guest out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and walked straight into the house without giving him another glance. Nolan started to follow, but Jeff quickly moved to block his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff glared at the young man who had caused his daughter so much pain, his voice turning ice-cold. &#34;If Eleanor isn&#39;t your number one priority, we&#39;ll never give our blessing to this marriage. You need to give up on that idea completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan could see that Jeff meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered with complete sincerity, &#34;Mr. Benton, my feelings for Eleanor have never changed. Please let her know that I&#39;m going to take care of Elora&#39;s situation once and for all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that promise, he turned around and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda watched his retreating figure and let out a deep sigh. &#34;That boy is incredibly stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone could see how much Nolan loved Eleanor, but his loyalty toward his close friend kept him from seeing what was right in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her poor daughter had to be suffering so much because of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff moved closer and wrapped his arms around his wife, rubbing her back in gentle circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t stress about it,&#34; he told her softly. &#34;If Nolan&#39;s not going to work out, we&#39;ll find someone much better for Eleanor. There are plenty of decent men in this world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda nodded in agreement with her husband&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to accept that Eleanor wouldn&#39;t be able to find true happiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had no clue that the Bentons had already given up on him entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was behind the wheel, his thoughts spinning in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was everyone.convinced that he was making a mistake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grandfather, Eleanor, even Ryland... every single person seemed to think he was in the wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Elora really was the source of all these problems? That thought made Nolan grab his phone with one hand. &#34;Pull the hospital&#39;s security footage. I want you to verify everything Elora and the doctor told us. Don&#39;t overlook anything, and keep this completely confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick responded with his usual professionalism, &#34;Understood, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truth was, he had been questioning Elora&#39;s stories for quite some time now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But being just an assistant, he knew his place and kept those suspicions to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan drove back to Regal Heights alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa greeted him with emptiness, lacking all the life and warmth that Eleanor used to fill it with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things weren&#39;t meant to turn out this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where exactly had everything started falling apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did they reach this breaking point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he really had been wrong about everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Elora was so fragile right now. He couldn&#39;t possibly abandon someone who had been his friend since childhood.</p>
