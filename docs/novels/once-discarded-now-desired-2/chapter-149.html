                <p>Unbeknownst to her, Eleanor had been set up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they left the restaurant, Nolan shadowed her every step, refusing to let her slip away, his persistence bordering on comical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she gave in and accompanied him to the Stewart Group building. The two shared the same space, but their minds wandered down different paths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would have been a stretch to call it quality time together-they worked in silence, each absorbed in their own world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Nolan set aside the last of his paperwork, his attention drifted across the room, softening the moment his eyes landed on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was sketching quietly, her movements so fluid they seemed effortless, a picture of elegance and concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people whispered that he was out of her league, but he never believed that. Deep down, he believed he was the one who didn&#39;t deserve her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had fought her way up from nothing. She was Enigma and Butterfly-always hinting at mysteries yet untold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He, by contrast, had been cushioned by family privilege his entire life. Had their lives been switched,he doubted he would have made it half as far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling his lingering gaze, Eleanor glanced up, their eyes meeting in a gentle, wordless exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension that once lingered between them had faded,replaced by genuine warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head, curious. &#34;Is there something you want to say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his pen aside and closed the distance between them, wrapping his arms around her with  quiet affection. &#34;Honestly, I just keep thinking how beautiful you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor batted his hand away, letting out an exasperated sigh. &#34;Go back to your work and stop hovering. I&#39;m in the middle of something important here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having her this close made it hard for Nolan to let go so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a mischievous glint, he tapped his cheek and gave her a playful look. &#34;A little incentive, and maybe I&#39;ll behave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew if she ignored him, he would never leave her alone. So Eleanor leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek. &#34;Happy now? Give me some space -I need to finish this drawing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did the trick. Nolan strolled back to his desk,grinning like he had just won the lottery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Erick walked in and caught sight of Nolan&#39;s lovestruck expression.  He fought the urge to roll his eyes. Pushing aside any comments, he got straight to business. &#34;Boss, we&#39;ve got a situation-Darleen Faulkner&#39;s been kidnapped,badly hurt, and she&#39;s out cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s security team always kept an eye on the big families in Elepdon, so news like this never slipped through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a nod to show he had heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick turned on his heel and left, silently grateful he hadn&#39;t interrupted his boss and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Nolan nor Eleanor gave Erick&#39;s update a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen wasn&#39;t someone who crossed their minds often, let alone someone they felt any attachment to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But neither of them could have predicted that the very next morning, everything would be turned upside down by a knock at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was spending the day at Hope House,surrounded by the children, when two police officers walked in with somber faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me. Which one of you is Eleanor Warren?&#34;one of them said, scanning the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor rose to her feet and quietly gestured for the children to head inside before she answered, &#34;I&#39;m Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both officers stepped closer, flashing their badges.&#34;We&#39;re here regarding an incident from yesterday.Darleen Faulkner was abducted and assaulted. She&#39;s in critical condition and hasn&#39;t regained consciousness. At the scene, there was a note naming you as the suspect. We&#39;ll need you to come down to the station and answer a few questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah,having caught wind of the disturbance, hurried over, her face etched with worry. &#34;There must be some mistake! Eleanor is gentle-she&#39;d never hurt anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor reached for Myah&#39;s hand and gave it a reassuring squeeze.  There was nothing for the innocent to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone was trying to set her up, she intended to face it head-on and see just how deep the scheme ran.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor met theofficers&#39; eyes calmly and nodded.&#34;Of course. I&#39;m ready whenever you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor walked out with the police, Myah&#39;s anxiety boiled over. She paced back and forth, wringing her hands as worry took hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be happening. She refused to let Eleanor become a scapegoat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fingers shaking, Myah fumbled for her phone and dialed in a hurry. &#34;Mr. Stewart,you have to help!The police just took Eleanor away-something&#39;s really wrong!&#34;</p>
