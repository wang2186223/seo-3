                <p>Once Eleanor wrapped up her interview in a single,confident sweep, the spotlight shifted. Lainey&#39;s turn to step into the Benton family&#39;s world had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting alone with the television&#39;s glow flickering across her face, Lainey could barely hide her jealousy watching Eleanor bask in the attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she reassured herself that soon,her new status would eclipse anything Eleanor could ever hope for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought a tight, triumphant smile to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her phone tucked away, she smoothed out her designer dress and moved toward the VIP lounge with purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the door swung open, Lainey summoned a surge of emotion, making her eyes glisten and releasing tears right on cue. &#34;Dad, Mom... I finally found my way back to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff Benton and his wife, Hilda Benton, lit up for a heartbeat when Lainey appeared, but their excitement faded as soon as they took a good look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her seemed off. Their real daughter shouldn&#39;t appear this calculating. She was striking,yes, but the look in her eyes was nothing like the open warmth the Benton family recognized as their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey sensed the shift right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, facts were on her side-the DNA results were indisputable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just had to smooth things over and win their trust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she brushed away a perfect tear, her voice tremulous and soft. &#34;Is there something about me that makes you uneasy? I know I grew up far from  home, and maybe I picked up a few bad habits. But if I have, just tell me and I&#39;ll do my best to change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words landed just as she intended, an apology that tugged at their hearts while quietly reminding them of her years apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Jeff&#39;s hesitation began to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey knew deep down that her sharp edges and calculating mind were not entirely her fault. If they hadn&#39;t lost her all those years ago, she would never have grown up learning to survive with such cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s heart lurched the moment he saw her dabbing at her tears. His voice cracked with guilt as he leaned toward her. &#34;Don&#39;t cry, sweetheart. None of this is your doing. We failed you. We&#39;re not upset with you.We&#39;re just... overwhelmed with joy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to his wife, urging her to speak.&#34;Isn&#39;t that right,honey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda swallowed her doubts, forcing a smile as she remarked softly, &#34;Yes, too happy for words.&#34; Lainey kept her expression soft and graceful, but beneath that calm exterior, exhilaration threatened to consume her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was finally seated among the Benton family-the most powerful and untouchable family in all of Zerovia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From this moment forward, their fortune, their prestige, their influence, would all become hers to claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the small talk faded, Lainey leaned in, sensing the moment was right. Her voice softened,trembling with hope as she begged, &#34;Dad, Mom,will you stay in Elepdon with me instead of going back to Breoqua?This is the place I know, the city where I grew up.1don&#39;t want to leave. I want to be here, with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, there was no comparison. Wealth overseas meant anonymity-no one would know her name, no one would bow to her presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But here in Elepdon, things would be different. She could crush Eleanor&#39;s pride, belittle Lillian in pub  and even turn Nolan&#39;s heart her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here,she could crown herself as the most admired,envied, and untouchable woman Elepdon had ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous glimmer flickered in Lainey&#39;s eyes, a spark of triumph edged with madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda caught it at once, and the sight made her stomach twist with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong-deeply wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her little girl had once mirrored her in every way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a child, her smile bent her eyes into crescent moons,bright and innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as an adult, she should have carried that same warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the woman before her radiated something entirely different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the DNA test had been undeniable. So why did her instincts scream otherwise?  A sudden thought struck Hilda like a bolt of lightning -what if this girl wasn&#39;t the daughter they had lost,but rather the key to finding the real one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, on the other hand, showed no such hesitation.His voice was gentle, reassuring. &#34;Very well. We won&#39;t go back. We&#39;ll stay here in Elepdon with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda plastered on a smile, forcing her doubts beneath the surface. &#34;Yes, darling, we&#39;ll stay.Tomorrow we&#39;ll have the estate cleaned and ready.You can move in with us right away, doesn&#39;t that sound wonderful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, she resolved to keep Lainey close, watching carefully until the truth revealed itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, blind to the suspicion in Hilda&#39;s heart, could barely contain her joy at their affection. Her pulse quickened, and excitement surged so strongly she almost trembled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the victory was already sealed. She believed she had fooled the mighty Benton family at last, and from this day forward, she was their rightful  daughter.</p>
