                <p>Since she couldn&#39;t convince Norwood, Lainey realized she would have to shift her focus to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a man&#39;s world, professional achievement and long-term gains always outweighed any feelings of affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Romance was little more than a pleasant afterthought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey doubted Nolan would choose love over such significant benefits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her resolve renewed, Lainey drove straight to Stewart Group headquarters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She timed her arrival perfectly, catching Nolan just as he was about to get into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,&#34; she called, her voice soft and inviting, so different from the composed confidence she showed at the Stewart family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Nolan laid eyes on her, his expression hardened with open contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly stepped around her, heading for the opposite car door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, suddenly desperate, rushed to block his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan!&#34; she called out again, her tone sharpening with impatience. &#34;Remember, I&#39;m the daughter of the Bentons now! With me by your side, we could rule the entire business world!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her voice, nearly shouting, &#34;What I can give you is something Eleanor could never dream of!She&#39;s just an orphan. I surpass her in background,looks, or ability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unable to understand where she had fallen short.When it came to lineage, appearance, or talent, what did Eleanor have that she didn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan finally came to a stop. He turned slowly, his gaze freezing cold and impossible to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you finished?&#34; he said, his voice low, barely more than a whisper, but each word laced with pure disdain as he took a step closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get one thing straight-we&#39;re not friends, so don&#39;t act like we are. It&#39;s revolting. My relationships aren&#39;t any of your business. And one more thing.&#34; His tone dropped even further. &#34;If you so much as bother Eleanor again, I&#39;ll make sure the Benton family disappears from Elepdon entirely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prestige of the Benton family from Breoqua meant nothing to him. Power or no power, they all bowed their heads to him in Elepdon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, Nolan slid into his car and drove off, leaving Lainey standing in the aftermath of his warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really threatened her like that? So be it! If Nolan and Eleanor wanted to be her enemies,they would have no one but themselves to blame for what happened next!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild, almost unhinged smile stretched across Lainey&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would see to it that Eleanor&#39;s name was dragged through the mud! Nolan would be forced to witness the utter humiliation of the woman he tried so hard to protect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would make sure Eleanor never recovered from the disgrace. Everyone would learn firsthand what it meant to stand in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in her car, Lainey&#39;s eyes landed on the event flyer for the upcoming art exhibition at Ashford Gallery.Eleanor&#39;s name was listed as an attendee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talk about great timing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An event like that was the ideal stage for a scandal. If something happened there, Eleanor would become the butt of every joke, her reputation shattered in a single night. Fueled by this plan, Lainey pulled out her phone and made a quick, cold call, rattling off a list of orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wicked smile then crept across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Eleanor had any realartistic ability.She had no idea what was about to hit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by her resolve, Lainey paid no heed to the cautions from the Bentons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was really Hilda&#39;s warning she ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda had told her to stay out of trouble and keep a low profile until the welcome-home banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda worried that Lainey would mistreat her biological daughter behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would listen to Hilda. After working so hard to climb into high society, how could she keep it to herself?</p>
