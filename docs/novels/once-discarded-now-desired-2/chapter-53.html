                <p>Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself sitting across from Nolan in a quiet, refined café just opposite the Stewart Group building. Nolan looked his usual self-composed, unreadable, and perfectly at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor&#39;s attention kept drifting to Lillian,who was perched right beside her like a cat itching to knock something off the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, why had she let Lillian tag along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew how much Lillian loved meddling,and now her presence only made it harder for Eleanor to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quiet sigh, Eleanor shot her a sharp, warning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s lips curved into a little pout, a flicker of  disappointment crossing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she knew better than to overstay her welcome,so she rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning close, she whispered in Eleanor&#39;s ear with a grin only the two could catch. &#34;Relax. My brother swears those rumors about Nolan being impotent are lies. HHe&#39;s definitely good in bed. So go on and snatch him up! I&#39;ll cheer for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a sly wink at Nolan, she swept out of the café looking far too pleased with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze, her mind blanking. What on earth was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was getting bolder and more outrageous by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking it off, she forced herself to focLIS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long breath,she pulled a folder from her bag and pushed it across the table. &#34;Mr. Stewart,&#34; she began carefully, &#34;about the Qualen Estates land, I know your company isn&#39;t planning to sell, but I need  it badly. I&#39;m prepared to increase my offer by ten percent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she wasn&#39;t just some ordinary buyer. She was the hidden force behind the Enigma Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t not for the risk of exposing herself, she wouldn&#39;t be here, lowering herself to ask a favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, however, didn&#39;t even blink. His fingers rested lazily against the table as he opened the document,skimmed a page, then shut it again and slid it back toward her. &#34;Not for sale,&#34; he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips pressed into a thin line. If it wasn&#39;t up for sale, why had he agreed to meet in the first place? Was he playing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw. &#34;Then what will it take for you to agree, Mr.Stewart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Nolan finally raised his eyes, their depth unreadable. &#34;Miss Warren, I said it&#39;s not for sale. But that doesn&#39;t mean other arrangements can&#39;t be made.&#34;  Her stomach tightened. What was he implying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, she realized she didn&#39;t understand this man at all; perhaps she never had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught the guarded look in her eyes. He noticed it, but it didn&#39;t bother him in the slightest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then reached into his briefcase, pulled out a folder, and slid a document across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced at it and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deed of gift for that land?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was giving it away, just like that? Her eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned the page again, and the truth finally sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t make sense. Why would he...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked up, blurting the question without hesitation. &#34;Why are you doing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan leaned back with ease, his posture casual, his eyes revealing nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our foundation has always backed Hope House.This is no different,&#34; he replied evenly, as though it was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor studied him closely, trying to pierce through the calm mask he wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, his thoughts remained a mystery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the issue that had weighed on her heart was resolved,and that alone steadied her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed aside the swirl of emotions and spoke earnestly. &#34;Thank you, Mr. Stewart, On behalf of the children, I truly appreciate what you&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint arch lifted his brow, and something playful lit up in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning forward, closing the space between them until his presence felt overwhelming,he murmured &#34;And how exactly do you plan on thanking me, Miss Warren?&#34; The effortless authority in his voice only made the air around him feel heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s pulse stumbled. Instinctively, she shifted back, trying to create some distance. &#34;If there ever comes a time you need my help,&#34; she said softly, &#34;I&#39;lI do everything I can.&#34;</p>
