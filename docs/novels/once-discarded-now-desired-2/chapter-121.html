                <p>The crowd followed the direction of the voice and saw Lainey approaching. She was flanked by two bodyguards who parted the crowd for her, with her confidence bordering on smugness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? What an ostentatious display! Anyone would think she wanted the world to know she was the long-lost daughter of the Bentons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the onlookers were rich girls, and some were even the daughters of influential officials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet not a single one of them arrived with half the fanfare Lainey brought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, most people dismissed Lainey&#39;s flashiness, though not a single person was bold enough to say so aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the Benton family&#39;s fortune soared, so did their sway in Elepdon. No one wanted to tempt fate or risk crossing them over something petty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, the crowd instinctively stepped aside, creating a path that left Eleanor and Nolan right in Lainey&#39;s line of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running into Eleanor there was clearly not part of Lainey&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She meant to pretend Eleanor didn&#39;t exist, but her attention caught on the man standing next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stood by Eleanor&#39;s side-a man with a reputation in Elepdon that rivaled her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might have been clueless, especially since he had ended up falling for someone like Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Lainey didn&#39;t let it bother her. Her own standing had risen, and she was convinced Nolan would recognize her value soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Lainey slid off her oversized sunglasses and, projecting polished confidence,strolled toward them. &#34;Mr. Stewart! What a surprise running into you tonight. My father mentioned how</p>
                
                
                
                <p>hectic you&#39;ve been lately. I didn&#39;t expect to see you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pretended just then to spot Eleanor and let out an exaggerated gasp. &#34;Oh, Miss Warren! I hardly recognized you. Honestly, a place like this usually draws the social elite, so it took me a second to realize it was you. Hope you don&#39;t take it the wrong way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving a theatrical little tap to her lips, she continued,&#34;Listen to me going on and on. Since you&#39;re with Mr.Stewart, it makes perfect sense you&#39;re here. Sorry for not realizing it sooner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s entire act was staged not just for the people nearby,but especially for Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to make it crystal clear that, as the Benton family&#39;s daughter, she was the only one who truly fit by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Much to her irritation, Nolan never even looked her way. His attention belonged entirely to Eleanor.  He reached out and tucked a loose strand of Eleanor&#39;s hair behind her ear in a gentle, familiar way.&#34;Let&#39;s get out of here. It&#39;s much too loud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their shopping done, Eleanor felt no reason to stick around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blushed and nodded lightly, feeling equal parts embarrassed and flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man... Why did he always have to make her heart race in front of an audience?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan saw nothing wrong with showing affection in public; if anything, he thought it wasn&#39;t nearly enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He confidently wrapped an arm around Eleanor&#39;s waist and guided her through the mall, shutting out everyone else as if the world had faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not once did he glance in anyone else&#39;s direction,least of all Lainey. A ripple of barely stifled laughter swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, famous for sucking up to those at the top and snubbing everyone beneath her, had been completely overlooked by Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should gossip start to spread, her humiliation would be the punchline at every gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to endure the humiliating stares any longer,Lainey bolted for the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; she snapped, hurling her purse onto the car seat as soon as the door slammed shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was always Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitch was the reason Nolan never looked her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did that bitch have that she didn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey realized head-on challenges were pointless. Nolan wouldn&#39;t budge for her usual games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wanted to win, she would need to change her approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single name suddenly leapt to mind-Norwood!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course! The gossip mill never stopped spinning tales of Nolan&#39;s endless clashes with his grandfather,all because of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she herself could get on Norwood&#39;s good side...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wouldn&#39;t that clear the way for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a household as distinguished as the Stewarts,marrying someone of equal status was seen as crucial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Norwood ever approve of Eleanor, a divorced woman with no connections?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She herself, on the other hand, had just reclaimed her place as the Benton family&#39;s daughter, her impeccable background, her social standing secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Nolan were the perfect match on pape Surely, Norwood would recognize that, unless he had lost all sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by this realization, Lainey immediately turned to her bodyguards, who had just caught up. &#34;Get me Norwood Stewart&#39;s itinerary. I want every detail.Don&#39;t miss a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, she had better watch out. The title of Nolan&#39;s wife would belong to her soon enough.</p>
