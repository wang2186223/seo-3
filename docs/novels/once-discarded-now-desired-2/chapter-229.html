                <p>The banquet hall was alive with chatter and the shimmer of evening gowns, the scent of perfume thick in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music floated over the crowd, and everyone seemed to be holding their breath, waiting for the main event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan didn&#39;t notice any of it. He stood at the edge of the stage, frowning, scanning the room with a growing unease. Eleanor was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, tasked with.greeting guests, hurried over. &#34;Nolan, where&#39;s Eleanor? Shouldn&#39;t she be here by now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head and pulled-out his phone, dialing Eleanor&#39;s number again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same unreachable tone rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Eleanor had agreed to this engagement, she wouldn&#39;t just disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart started to pound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Nolan rushed toward her dressing room, Lillian close behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when they arrived, the room was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic tightened Nolan&#39;s chest. He barked an order tothe hotel manager who had trailed them, &#34;Check all the surveillance cameras. Now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Erick appeared,pale and tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, there&#39;s trouble at the Benton estate,&#34; he whispered.&#34;It&#39;s on fire, and the flames are spreading fast.Also, the investigation into Miss Warren&#39;s connection to the Bentons is complete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard before adding, &#34;She is their daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa was burning, and Eleanor, their daughter...she had to be there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was in danger!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind snapped into focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, the staff who had been looking for Eleanor came back, out of breath. &#34;Mr. Stewart, we checked the footage. Miss Warren left through the back door about thirty minutes ago. She seemed to be heading straight for the Benton estate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Nolan needed to hear. He didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold, determined edge settled over him as he strode toward the exit. &#34;Get the car ready. We&#39;re going to the Bentons&#39;,&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m coming with you!&#34; Lillian exclaimed, trying to follow, but Nolan&#39;s gaze pinned her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here and manage the guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration flared across her face, but she knew the responsibility rested on her, so she reluctantly nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden in the corridor&#39;s shadows, Lainey watched everything with a cruel smile spreading across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they get there, there would be no one left to save.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, as Nolan&#39;s sleek Bentley raced down the road, Eleanor had just gotten out of the taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ahead of her, flames shot high into the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa looked like a massive bonfire, and the air was heavy with the sharp sting of smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to run toward it, but security had already set up a long barricade. &#34;You can&#39;t go in there! It&#39;s too dangerous!&#34; one of them shouted. Eleanor ignored him and held onto the ripped hem of her dress, determined to get inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down! Wait for the firefighters!&#34; the man pleaded, stepping in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents were trapped inside.How could she wait calmly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even gotten to call them Mom and Dad yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to think. With a fierce glare, she shoved past the guards and charged straight into the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke wrapped around her instantly, burning her lungs and skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She coughed, tears running down her face but she didn&#39;t stop! Nothing was going to hold her back.</p>
