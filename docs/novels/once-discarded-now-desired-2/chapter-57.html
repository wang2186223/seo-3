                <p>Following several days spent with Lillian, another appointment was already waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This would mark the third and final round of treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie stirred awake more than once throughout the procedure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, with Eleanor in disguise, Fannie never guessed her true identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor prepared to insert the last needle, the room&#39;s door swung open, and Nolan entered, his eyes covered by a cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand faltered just a moment, frustration prickling at her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all days, why did he have the luxury to supervise  in person now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least he had the sense to keep his eyes shielded,or else she would have had to stop right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she regained her composure, Eleanor inserted the last needle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A short wait would be necessary before she could remove the needles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan remained off to the side, saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor expected the silence to linger, but he broke it with an unexpected compliment. &#34;Your abilities as a healer are impressive, Soul Surgeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan continued, undeterred by her lack of response,&#34;The last doctor who treated my sister believed her case was almost hopeless. In only three weeks,you&#39;ve managed to help her recover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan rarely spoke at such length.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he trying to uncover something? A frown settled on Eleanor&#39;s face, but she kept her silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since his eyes stayed hidden, she figured there was nothing for him to pick up on as long as she stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, Nolan shifted just enough to face her directly, even with the cloth over his eyes. &#34;Soul Surgeon, are you familiar with clinical medicine at Northbridge University?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s hand trembled for a moment. &#34;I know a little about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, this bothersome man would not give up until she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Northbridge University ranked as the nation&#39;s top school. Acting clueless would only invite suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, after she answered, Nolan edged closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although a black cloth still covered his eyes, the faint  lift of his lips showed he was in good spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing so near, Eleanor could once again catch that familiar crisp scent of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I happen to know someone who had a degree in the clinical medicine from Northbridge University. She&#39;d be thrilled if she heard you were interested in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he be talking about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he growing suspicious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she needed to cut this conversation short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, the session wrapped up just then, giving her an excuse to steer away from the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The treatment is finished, and your sister has made a full recovery. There will be no need for us to meet again.&#34; Eleanor delivered the words quickly, gathered her tools without delay, and intended to leave the room,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Nolan blocked her way without a hint of panic.&#34;What&#39;s the hurry? I wanted to discuss Fannie&#39;s  aftercare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring at his striking features, Eleanor fought back a wave of irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l send all the instructions to the number that reached out before.&#34; She tried to slip past him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan appeared to sense what she was about to do and stepped in just enough to block her way again.&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I suppose I&#39;m a bit restless. I want to hear about my sister&#39;s condition directly from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with the cloth over his eyes, it felt as though his gaze pinned her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of impatience crept up on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly blurted out a demand to know what he really wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her better judgment stopped her just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exposing herself now would bring nothing but headaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her jaw set and her voice steady, she said, &#34;Mr. Stewart, I&#39;d appreciate it if you respected my boundaries. I trust your staff has already explained my terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her meaning was obvious. She wanted him to stop digging into who she really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of amusement flickered across Nolan&#39;s face as he lifted his brows. He could see that Eleanor still stayed sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he finally moved aside, letting her through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief swept over Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for the door, only for Nolan&#39;s low voice to echo behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soft as it was, the sound struck her like a jolt.&#34;Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire body went rigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every muscle froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this a confession of what he knew?  Or was he just fishing for a reaction?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let anything slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without turning or giving any sign, Eleanor pulled the door open and slipped out, never once looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan removed the black cloth from his eyes, a pleased smile settling on his lips as he watched her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt in his mind now. It truly was Eleanor.</p>
