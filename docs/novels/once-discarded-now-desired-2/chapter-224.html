                <p>At the Stewart Group&#39;s private hospital, Norwood lounged against a pile of pillows, savoring his coffee with a smug sense of accomplishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Muted voices in the hallway brought a rare smile to his lips. At last, he had managed to rattle that unyielding grandson of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Nolan stood in the corridor, his glare sharp enough to cut glass. The butler blocked the door,shrinking under the pressure of his stormy mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension hung in the air like a thundercloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me the truth. How is he really doing?&#34; Nolan pressed,his patience wearing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler&#39;s face contorted in practiced grief. His voice wavered as he clung to his script. &#34;Mr. Stewart,please don&#39;t be alarmed. The moment your grandfather heard about your engagement to Miss Warren, he fainted, collapsed from the shock. The doctor&#39;s not optimistic. He says it&#39;s... critical.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A muscle jumped in Nolan&#39;s jaw. &#34;Move. I&#39;m going in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waffling for time, the butler stammered, searching for an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick stepped up, eyes steely, and all but yanked the butler aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasted no time. He swept into the room and pushed open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Norwood made a show of hastily shoving his coffee cup beneath the pillow and squeezing his eyes shut,feigning unconsciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His movements were swift, but they still left behind signs that something had been done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes landed on the coffee-streaked sheets and the cup clumsily tucked beneath the pillow, as if someone had tried to hide it in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan took it all in, a sigh catching in his chest. He dropped into the chair at Norwood&#39;s bedside, choosing not to call out the theatrics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa,I&#39;ve followed your lead for as long as I can remember. I know you&#39;re still angry about what happened with Dad, but blaming Eleanor for his choices isn&#39;t fair. I&#39;ve made my decision about her,and I want your blessing, not your resentment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s eyelids fluttered, then he opened his eyes,  sharp and lucid. &#34;You won&#39;t marry anyone but her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without the slightest hesitation, Nolan nodded,unwavering. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh broke from Norwood, bitter and brimming with anger. &#34;Unbelievable! This is the legacy I&#39;ve built?This is my successor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat upright, jabbing a trembling finger in Nolan&#39;s direction, his voice rising with each word. &#34;If that&#39;s how it is, you&#39;ll sign over every share of Stewart GGroup you own. From this moment on, I have no grandson. Do what you want,marry who you please. You&#39;re nothing to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stung, but Nolan kept his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood, bowed deeply, and said with quiet resolve,&#34;I&#39;ll have Erick handle the transfer today. As for you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head, gaze steady and sincere. &#34;You&#39;ve been my family, and nothing can change that. No matter what you say, you&#39;ll always be my grandfather.Eleanor and I will visit you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned and walked out, every step certain,without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Norwood trembled with rage, chest rising and falling as anger overtook him. He snatched the pillow off the bed and flung it hard in the direction of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pillow struck the door with a dull thud before dropping to the floor, lifeless and still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler slipped quietly into the room, careful not to provoke Norwood&#39;s simmering anger. &#34;Mr. Stewart,your grandson-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s voice cracked like a whip. &#34;Defiant.Completely defiant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips quivered, his rage barely held in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never imagined Nolan pushing back so relentlessly, never once wavering in his decision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing his eyes, Norwood took a slow breath,fighting to regain his composure. When he looked up again,his eyes were icy and calculatng. &#34;Find Wray. Bring him here,now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler felt a chill run down his spine and hurried to obey. &#34;At once, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan made his way out of the hospital,heading straight for the waiting Bentley parked at the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick climbed behind the wheel, stealing a look in the  mirror at his boss, who looked calm and unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just got word, Mr. Stewart. your grandfather&#39;s sending for Wray,&#34; Erick reported quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in the family knew Wray had always eyed Nolan&#39;s position from the shadows. All he needed was a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Norwood&#39;s latest move, his intentions couldn&#39;t be clearer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s face betrayed nothing. He barely glanced up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had seen this coming long ago and was ready for whatever Norwood tried next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what, he wouldn&#39;t let anyone, not even his grandfather, come between him and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell Ryland to keep an eye on things. For now,your only priority is getting the engagement plans in order.And keep this from Eleanor. She doesn&#39;t need the extra worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick nodded, understanding every unspoken order.&#34;Consider it done.&#34;</p>
