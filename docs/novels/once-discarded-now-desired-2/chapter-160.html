                <p>Rage filled Jeff&#39;s eyes, and his voice shook. &#34;Lainey,tell me exactly what happened. I promise, I&#39;ll fight for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt ready to take on anyone, even royalty, if it meant avenging his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey slipped easily into her usual act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept insisting she had only slipped and fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Jeff pressed her with question after question,she finally gave in, her tone wavering. &#34;It was Jonny.He claimed the Todd Group was in trouble and wanted me to get money from you. I refused him,and that&#39;s when he...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sentence faded, but the sadness on her face was unmistakable. A man who would lay a hand on his own wife for money, Jeff thought he was the lowest of the low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury made Jeff&#39;s whole body tremble, veins throbbing at his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonny crossed the line!&#34; he shouted. &#34;Where is he?I&#39;ll handle this mnyself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made to leave, but Lainey caught his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, don&#39;t! Please stay here.&#34; She clung to him,desperate. &#34;He said all sorts of lies, calling me reckless while I was abroad. If those rumors start to spread, especially to the Stewarts, what am l supposed to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff lost what little patience he had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny had crossed every line, first with violence,then by dragging Lainey&#39;s name through the mud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely shameless!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he would ever let his daughter  stay mixed up with someone that foul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping Lainey&#39;s hand, he promised, &#34;Don&#39;t worry.I&#39;ll end your marriage to him myself. I&#39;ll hire the best lawyer in the city and make sure Jonny leaves empty-handed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave her a reassuring look. &#34;And about the Stewarts? As long as I&#39;m around, no one&#39;s going to lay a finger on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling comforted, Lainey leaned against his shoulder and whispered, &#34;You really are the best,Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the two of them were busy planning the divorce, Hilda had already made her way to the entrance of Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Eleanor even for a second at the hospital had shaken her to her core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t wait any longer. She had to see her daughter, even if it meant nothing more than a brief meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of caution and advice about biding her time faded away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was her child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed no proof, no one else&#39;s permission, no more waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart knew the truth, and that was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word had reached Hilda that Eleanor had come straight here after leaving the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She planned to go in right away and seek her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Myah explained that Eleanor had just left, heading out with Fannie only afew minutes before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment washed over Hilda all over again,heavy and familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She forced herself to smile, hiding her regret. &#34;That&#39;s unfortunate,&#34;she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, a thought came to her, and she continued, &#34;I hope you don&#39;t mind me asking, but...Could you tell me about Eleanor when she was little?I&#39;d love to hear about her favorite foods, what she liked to wear, what she played with, anything at all.I just want to know her better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried she might seem strange, she quickly added,&#34;It&#39;s just, | feel such a connection to her. Even if we aren&#39;t related, I&#39;d still like to understand who she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah gave Hilda a long look, suddenly struck by how much she resembled Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time they had met, it had been in passing and easy to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, the similarities were hard to ignore. Maybe,just maybe, there was something more to it. Guided by a sense of fate, Myah began sharing stories from Eleanor&#39;s childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nostalgia colored her words, while Hilda listened in silence, her heart aching with every memory, and the conversation lingered on and on.</p>
