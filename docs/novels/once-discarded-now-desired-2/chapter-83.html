                <p>Word spread fast, and soon Eleanor heard that Lillian had been cornered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she had no plans to step in, let alone expose herself as Enigma. She would have rather sat back and watched Lainey embarrass herself. But what she didn&#39;t expect was for Lainey&#39;s fans to drag Lillian into the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was the one person Eleanor refused to see harmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would let anyone stain her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she pulled out her phone and hit send on a tweet.&#34;Lainey plagiarized Enigma&#39;s work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasn&#39;t the type to throw out claims without evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Along with the post, she attached the edited draft from earlier-the one signed, clear as day. Enigma. The reaction online was instant chaoS. Die-hard Enigma fans quickly chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow, Eleanor might be telling the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That draft looks way better than Lainey&#39;s version.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s Enigma&#39;s signature, no doubt about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the majority weren&#39;t hardcore fans. They were just casual followers who couldn&#39;t really judge art. In their eyes, Lainey was Enigma. She had the title, and that was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead of support, Eleanor&#39;s comments section was flooded with attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where would an orphan like you even get Enigma&#39;s drafts? You probably swiped them from Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Everyone knows you and Lainey don&#39;t get along.You&#39;re just bitter&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You dare go against Lainey? Don&#39;t make me laugh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Waving around some random design and calling it proof? Wait till the lawyers come knocking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jonny had his eyes glued to the online storm. As he scrolled through the comments, a memory surfaced-Eleanor used to spend hours sketching in the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, he assumed she was just idly passing the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, could it be that Lainey had stolen her designs all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Eleanor actually be Enigma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,that was ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way...or was there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny tried to brush the thought away, but a nagging uneasinessclung to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To clear his mind, he figured he would go straight to Lainey and ask her about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting time, he headed upstairs to look for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey saw him walk back into the room,her heart skipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic rushed through her. Why was he here now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be buried in work in the study ? Did he... see Eleanor&#39;s post too? The idea made her pulse quicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, Jonny paused for a moment, then asked,&#34;Lainey, what&#39;s going on with that post Eleanor made?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey quickly steadied herself and met his eyes with a calm look. &#34;Baby, strangers might doubt me, but you don&#39;t, right? That sketch was mine. I drew it years ago while I was abroad and sold it soon after. I never imagined Eleanor would buy it just to smear me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a quiet sigh, her expression softening into something more earnest. &#34;Really think about it. If I wasn&#39;t the designer, how else could I have the original sketches and turn them into an actual dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure how Eleanor had gotten her hands on the draft, but fear wasn&#39;t something she allowed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what she knew, the true Enigma was a foreigner who had disappeared from the spotlight three years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, the Enigma Group had stayed completely silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Enigma had no intention of revealing their identity So why shouldn&#39;t she use this chance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she played her part right, she was Enigma. The thought gave her confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny,meanwhile, felt the knot in his chest loosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was convinced now-Lainey had to be Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, if Eleanor were the real one, wouldn&#39;t she have said something years ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He even thought, if she had, maybe their marriage wouldn&#39;t have ended the way it did</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the relief in his eyes, Lainey wasted no time nudging him back toward the study</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, she pulled out her phone and crafted another tweet, puttinng on just the right shade of wounded innocence. &#34;The truth will stand on its own. I trust those who truly know me will continue to believe in me.&#34;</p>
