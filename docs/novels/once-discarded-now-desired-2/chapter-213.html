                <p>Once Eleanor set her mind to it, she wasted no time.She spotted a thug loitering in the hall, offered a casual smile, and asked to borrow his phone, saying she only wanted something to do out of boredom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she was clearly someone Horace valued,the man hesitated but still handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before passing it to her, though, he pulled out the SIM card like a paranoid old man. &#34;Wi-Fi&#39;s on. You can use the apps and games,&#34; he muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t protest. She simply took the phone and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,when the coast was clear, she slipped back into the room Horace had once dragged her into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, she snapped photos of everything related to Lainey and sent them to her own email.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After finishing, she returned to her quarters and tried to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was piecing together her next move when a soft knock interrupted her thoughts, and a few servants  stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first carried a folded set of elaborate ceremonial clothes, and the others trailed behind with trays of dinner fit for royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am,&#34; the one in front said nervously, &#34;this ceremonial attire is prepared by Mr. Boyd for tomorrow&#39;s ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze drifted over the group until it landed on a man standing half-hidden at the back, almost blending with the shadows near the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition clicked instantly. It was him, the one she had bumped into earlier in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her attention, he looked up briefly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met for a second before he quickly lowered his head again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor caught on right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back lazily in her chair, completely ignoring the fancy meal set in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t eat this crap. I want traditional food from my country. Tell your chef to figure it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lead servant stiffened. At this hour, where would they find someone who could cook foreign food?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of them dared to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had been warned beforehand that this young lady was precious to Horace, and even Darlene thought highly of her. Offending her would be as good as signing their own death warrants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helpless, the lead servant managed a polite smile.&#34;Of course, ma&#39;am. We&#39;ll make the arrangements right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bowed, gathered up the untouched food, and quickly left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor waved off the rest of the attendants until only one man remained, the one standing by the door.She tilted her chin slightly toward him, her tone carrying an air of command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You! Yes, the one standing there doing nothing.Come here and massage my legs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man closed the door quietly and walked toward her with an easy, honest smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll do it,&#34; he responded with a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as he approached, Eleanor&#39;s relaxed expression  hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you really?&#34; she asked sharply. &#34;Show me proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note had looked like Nolan&#39;s handwriting, but she couldn&#39;t rule out the possibility of a trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s smile disappeared. Silently, he reached inside his jacket, pulled out a small object, and placed it in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an emblem, its center carved with a single word -Stewart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crest of the Stewart family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s tension finally eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had seen Nolan with one before and knew it was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she returned it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man bowed his head respectfully. &#34;Miss. Warren,you need not worry. I represent the Stewart Group here in Zerovia, and everyone knows me as McCollum.Mr. Stewart sent me to tell you that we&#39;ll take action during tomorrow night&#39;s ceremony. Be prepared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave a slight nod. At that very moment, loud banging rattled the door,and a drunken man&#39;s voice slurred from outside,&#34;Open up, little beauty. Let me keep you company tonight.&#34;</p>
