                <p>Jonny stepped into the Todd Group headquarters looking worn down, his jaw shadowed with unshaven stubble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several sleepless nights had left him drained, dark circles etched heavily beneath his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHis suit jacket hung limply over one arm, his tie was nowhere to be seen, and the open collar of his shirt made his entire appearance seem ragged and burdened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Employees trickling out after work caught sight of him and quickly lowered their heads, slipping past in silence as though afraid of provoking his temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than head straight to the conference room, Jonny made his way into his private office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sank heavily into the leather chair, eyes shutting in helpless frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Allard, how&#39;s the assignment I gave you coming along?&#34; he asked without opening them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rejection from the Stewart Group and several other major firms had forced Jonny to shift to a different approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, his strategy was to draw smaller companies into the fold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though these firms could contribute only limited amounts, mere tens of millions each, together their backing might be enough to breathe life into the Usepsall project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By offering them attractive incentives, the Todd Group could still make the deal worthwhile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard, waiting patiently at his side, responded quickly, &#34;Mr. Todd, the plan is workable. More than ten small firms have already expressed interest. Still, the terms of cooperation will need your approval. I&#39;ve arranged for you to meet with them tomorrow at three o&#39;clock at the Lumina Hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Jonny reacted. His bloodshot eyes opened slowly, and he gave a weary nod of acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, a sliver of good news had arrived. As long as money kept moving, the Todd Group still had a chance to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny was just beginning to ease his tension when he caught sight of Allard lingering with an uneasy look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it? Out with it,&#34; Jonny insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sharp prompt, Allard&#39;s shoulders stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat, struggling to line up his words before speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The issue could have been trivial, but his gut told him it was anything but.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mustering his nerve, he delivered the message. &#34;Enigma&#39;s assistant announced this morning that they&#39;re preparing to establish a firm named Enigma Group in Vladena and have already begun reaching out for bids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning was clear-those smaller investment firms might turn away from the Todd Group and throw their support behind Enigma Group instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown carved across Jonny&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma? The name sparked a vague memory, tied to whispers of an elusive figure in the design world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within the industry, Enigma&#39;s reputation ranked at the very top, yet nobody knew whether this talent was man or woman,young or old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only detail anyone knew about this designer was the name-Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once a year, without fail, Enigma released exactly ten designs. They were fixed drafts, never revised or altered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their distinct style and visionary concepts turned each piece into a masterpiece, drawing in fashion elites around the globe who were willing to pay staggering prices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hadn&#39;t Enigma only been selling design sketches these last three years? Why suddenly take the leap into forming a company?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Jonny felt little concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exceptional talent in design did not mean the same in business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brand-new enterprise could hardly compare to the Todd Group, which was already listed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, he had given enough incentives in the Usepsall project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless those company leaders had taken leave of their senses, they would know where their best choice lay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, the darkness clouding his expression lifted. He gave Allard a brisk directive. &#34;Clear out those old men in the conference room. Tell them funding is already secured. If they want to dump their shares or back out, let them. They can&#39;t use that to pressure me. And if they want to stay on as shareholders of the Todd Group, they&#39;d better fall in line.&#34; Though unease twisted in his gut, Allard bowed quickly. &#34;Understood, Mr. Todd.&#34;</p>
