                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes sharpened as she lunged forward, managing to catch the woman before her fragile body hit the ground. The weight in her arms was shockingly light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could anyone be this thin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The younger child standing nearby let out a frightened gasp and hurried over. &#34;Fannie! Fannie, talk to me!Are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to reassure her. Eleanor focused on Fannie Stewart, scanning her condition with practiced urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well... Something was clearly off with the girl&#39;s health.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But worrying about long-term issues could wait. For now, Eleanor needed to wake her and keep the oxygen flowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t act quickly, the damage could be permanent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting without hesitation, she pulled a silver from her kit and pressed it against Fannie&#39;s thumb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Fannie&#39;s eyelids fluttered and life slowly returned to her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slipped the tool away and released a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding. &#34;Hey, you&#39;re awake.How do you feel? You shouldn&#39;t be out here in this condition. Come inside with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bent down, ready to help Fannie to her feet, when a tall shadow closed the distance toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fannie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Nolan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stiffened at once, her body tense as if she had been caught doing something wrong. Every part of her wanted to retreat. Foints demost Her instincts warned her to keep her distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it hit her-the frail woman in her arms was none other than his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense. No one else could stir that level of panic in Nolan, and no other woman around that age came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;fl let you take care of her, Mr. Stewart.&#34; Eleanor spoke calmly, guiding the younger child&#39;s hand as she prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s brows tightened, and his piercing stare locked onto her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in that fleeting moment, he had noticed. That skillful maneuver hadn&#39;t come from an amateur.Eleanor possessed real medical training.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts flickered back to David&#39;s recent exhibition. Whispers had spread that the legendary Soul Surgeon would appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the event ended, the only unforgettable figure had been Eleanor, dazzling and mysterious-and the Soul Surgeon had remained unseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctors from all over the world had spent years trying to treat Fannie, yet none of them could find a cure.Now, with a single intervention, Eleanor had managed to save her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That alone made Nolan&#39;s instincts flare. Nothing about this seemed ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cut across her path before she could slip away. &#34;Hold on. Since when do you know medicine, Miss Warren?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back slowly, she forced a light smile. &#34;Come on, Mr. Stewart, surely you&#39;ve heard.I graduated from Northbridge University with two majors. One of them was clinical medicine, and I do hold a medical license.&#34;She wasn&#39;t lying-every word of that was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The diploma bore Northbridge University&#39;s seal, and the license was official. Nolan&#39;s eyes narrowed, sharp and unrelenting, though he chose silence over argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could press further, Fannie&#39;s soft voice broke in. &#34;Miss Warren, thank you for helping me. My brother was just scared for me. He didn&#39;t mean to sound harsh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wanted to believe Fannie, but Nolan&#39;s penetrating stare told another story. His gaze searched her face as if peeling back layers she hadn&#39;t intended to reveal, and it was far more unsettling than she cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit back her frustration. Picking a fight with him was out of the question, but keeping her distance should still be possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, why on earth was Nolan showing up at Hope House with his sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The child in her arms tugged gently at her sleeve and spoke in a bright tone. &#34;Eleanor, you&#39;ve got it wrong.Fannie and Nolan are really kind! Nolan&#39;s been bringing us gifts for years, and Myah always says he&#39;s nice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nearly laughed at the absurdity of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this some kind of joke?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, the ruthless powerhouse who dominated the business world with no mercy, was the same man these children praised as generous and good-hearted?</p>
