                <p>Rage boiled in Jonny like never before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days had passed without him setting foot at home, his excuse always circling back to endless work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, however, wasn&#39;t fooled for a second. She knew he was simply growing weary of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she could just wait around while everything slipped through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she had full control over the Todd Group, Jonny still mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While those thoughts tangled in her mind, a headline suddenly jumped out at her. &#34;Enigma Group is about to hold a fashion design competition. Word is, the top three might even earn the chance to become Enigma&#39;s personal students.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of being chosen as a student of Enigma sent her heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such recognition was priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their backing, she could rise to the top of the fashion world in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had that kind of power, would Jonny&#39;s loyalty even matter anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her time studying fashion design overseas gave her confidence. A competition like this wouldn&#39;t intimidate her-it was an open door she was readý to step through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fueled by resolve, she wasted no time signing up for the competition. Afterward, she hurried upstairs to the study, eager to capture her ideas before the spark faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was rummaging through her supplies, a sheet of paper slipped free from a heavy notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t blank. It was a sketch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The design screamed sophistication, its elegance rivaling the signaure style of Enigma Group. Her mind spun with questions. Who could have drawn this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,that was absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just an orphan; what could she possibly know about design?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fate had practically handed her this masterpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a few adjustments, the judges would be floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone sent a thrill through her. Heart racing, she sat down at the desk, her pencif scratching furiously across the page as she reshaped the sketch into her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days later, in the Podium Apartments, Lillian&#39;s nerves betrayed her. She kept sneaking glances at Eleanor,who lay sprawled on the sofa, lazily flipping through a magazine. Words hovered on her lips, but hesitation kept them locked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several days had slipped by since Nolan&#39;s confession, yet Eleanor hadn&#39;t once stepped outside her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was unbearable. How could her favorite love story stall like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scooted closer and whispered, &#34;Eleanor, I heard the fashion design competition your firm is hosting already narrowed things down to eight finalists, and one of them is supposed to be a genius. Honestly,you&#39;re incredible! Only you could think of such a clever way to promote Enigma while finding the best talent at the same time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor flipped another page, her eyes still glued to the magazine. &#34;Cut the sweet talk. What do you actually want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic bubbled in Lillian&#39;s chest. She needed to push Eleanor into the world again. Without bumping into Nolan, how could their romance possibly move forward?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the self-appointed matchmaker, she was running out of tricks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the perfect solution popped into her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, Sallie&#39;s seventieth birthday is coming up in a few days. I know you got the invitation too. Why don&#39;t we go together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd family had its flaws, but Sallie had always been different-kindhearted and generous. On top of it,Eleanor was in her debt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible for Eleanor not to feel a tug at her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand stilled mid-turn of the magazine, though she didn&#39;t voice an answer right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the hesitation, Lillian leaned in and whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re nervous about bumping into Nolan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave a sharp laugh. &#34;Me? Nervous? Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just didn&#39;t feel like giving him another opening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, she was not sure how she was supposed to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of friendship had made Eleanor an open book to Lillian, and she could read every thought behind those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Armed with that knowledge, Lillian putsher plan into motion. &#34;You can relax. I already checked-he left the country a couple of days ago and hasn&#39;t come back yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second she heard that, Eleanor snapped upright from her lazy sprawl. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, it was Sallie&#39;s birthday celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had every reason to show up, pay her respects, and checked in on Sallie.</p>
