                <p>The kiss came crashing down on Eleanor-fierce,burning,impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shudder rippled through her as Nolan&#39;s feverish heat seared her, forcing her to push against his chest ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, you-&#34; she began, ready to point out the fever blazing through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her voice faltered when his broken, hoarse whisper slipped through clenched teeth. &#34;Eleanor...help me... I&#39;m in torment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze locked onto Nolan, his eyes bloodshot with a fire barely contained. Then she noticed the gash on his arm-the wound he had carved into himself for her sake. Her last line of resistance crumbled like sand in the tide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All reason abandoned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave up fighting, tilted her head back, and-clumsy but desperate-returned his kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, heat and desire burned like wildfire,wrapping the room in heady passion. By dawn, Eleanor stirred awake to a trail of feather-light kisses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body felt drained, every bone aching with exhaustion, and without thinking, she curled closer to the warmth holding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mm... stop it,&#34; she mumbled drowsily, her voice heavy with the sweetness of half-sleep. &#34;Let me sleep a little longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been her first time-and Nolan had pushed her limits until the small hours-so she was utterly spent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gazed down at the woman in his arms, soft and languid like a lazy kitten. His eyes shone with raw affection and an unmistakable pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was his now. Entirely, irrevocably his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made him bend to kiss Eleanor&#39;s forehead with reverence, his voice gentle. &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased himself out of bed, careful not to wake her,tucked the blanket securely around her, then slipped on a robe and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the instant the door clicked shut behind him,all warmth drained from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was time to deal with Trudy. His expression hardened to steel as he strode into the living room, where Erick stood waiting stiffly like a soldier before his commander.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick had gotten a panicked call from the hotel manager last night. Alarmed, he had hurried over at dawn,fearing the worst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Nolan appeared, Erick lowered his head respectfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sank onto the sofa, legs crossed, his gaze glacial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Trudy?&#34; he asked, voice razor-sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s pulse skipped, but he answered quickly,&#34;Locked in the room next door, sir. She has been crying and demanding to see you all night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lips curled into a cold, derisive smile. See him?She wasn&#39;t worthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send her back to the Whites&#39;,&#34; he ordered flatly.&#34;And find out where she got that drug. Someone supplied her, and I want an explanation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sort of drug was tightly guarded, forbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Trudy to get her hands on it meant she hadn&#39;t acted alone.And Nolan had every intention of smoking out the culprit and making them pay dearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick bowed low. &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped out at once, too wise to linger a heartbeat longer.</p>
