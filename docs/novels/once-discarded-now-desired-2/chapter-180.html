                <p>Late that night, when Fraser was making his move, a knock echoed at Eleanor&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for a moment. Who would come at this hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cautiously walked over and peeked through the peephole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the dim corridor light, she could see that two men were standing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taller one, barely managing to stay upright, leaned almost completely against the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together the instant she recognized them. It was Nolan. And beside him was Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The minute she opened the door, the strong smell of alcohol hit her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s face looked like he&#39;d finally found a lifeline. &#34;Miss Warren, Mr. Stewart got himself drunk and insisted he had to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words carried both complaint and helplessness as he nudged Nolan forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stumbled straight into her, and Eleanor caught him instinctively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat pulsed through his body, searing her fingertips even through his clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just how much had he been drinking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick, relieved to have unloaded his burden, immediately backed away. &#34;Then I&#39;ll leave him with you, Miss Warren!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped out almost at once, even pulling the door shut neatly behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, in his mind, he had done all he could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor,however, was left staring at the man slumped against her, completely unconscious. being pushed into this situation? With no other choice, she dragged him step by step toward the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was heavier than she expected, and her balance faltered. The next second, both of them toppled onto the cushions, with Nolan landing squarely on top of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his drunken haze, Nolan seemed to catch a familiar scent, one he had longed for endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pried his eyes open, blurred as they were, and locked on to the face before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone consumed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he lowered his head and kissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taste of strong alcohol mixed with the heat of his mouth stole her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stiffened, startled by how sudden it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His kiss wasn&#39;t skilled, but there was a gentleness to it, like he was both unsure and wanting more at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was almost out of air, he finally let go, but instead of pulling back, he leaned into the curve of her neck, rubbing against her skin like someone finally finding a safe haven after being lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart thudded wildly,her cheeks burning hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed at his shoulder weakly. &#34;Nolan, you&#39;re heavy. I can&#39;t breathe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she spoke, his arms only.poulled her in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words came muffled, thick with drink, yet achingly vulnerable. &#34;Eleanor, why didn&#39;t you wait for me today? I shouldn&#39;t have let you feel hurt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard this, the faint sweetness that had bloomed in her chest vanished. She pushed at him again, just enough to make space. &#34;Hurt? How could I be hurt? Nolan, I&#39;m not the kind of woman people pity. I never had a proper family. I&#39;ve been on my own since I can remember. If anything, I&#39;m the troublemaker, not the one who gets pushed around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan flinched at her words. Hearing her belittle herself like that was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head, gaze steady despite the alcohol clouding his eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t say that. To me, you&#39;re the best person I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sudden sincerity unsettled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly looked away and slipped out from under him to stand. &#34;I&#39;ll go make you some warm milk. Maybe it&#39;ll help clear your head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had boarely taken a step when Nolan&#39;s hand caught her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next second, she was back under him on the sofa, his body hovering above hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still carried the faint smell of alcohol, but it was his closeness, his warmth, and his intent that made the air feel heavy, almost electric. &#34;I mean it,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her flushed cheeks and the slight wideness in her gaze, his throat moving as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his head until his lips were just a breath away from hers, he asked softly, almost like a spell, &#34;Can !?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two simple words, but the weight of them was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t just a kiss he wanted. It was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Eleanor&#39;s mind spin, her reason and emotions pulling her in opposite directions. For a heartbeat, she almost gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, clarity won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Nolan leaned in to kiss her, Eleanor&#39;s fingers shifted ever so slightly. A needle slipped quietly into her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one quick move, she pressed it into his skin that forced his body into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, once burning with desire, dulled in an instant, and he slumped heavily against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t move and stayed still under his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, the only sound in the room was his steady breathing and her own erratic heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, she lifted a shaky hand, covering her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was slipping out of control. Completely, utterly out of control.</p>
