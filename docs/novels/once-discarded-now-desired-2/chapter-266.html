                <p>Meanwhile, in the master bedroom, Eleanor summoned every ounce of her strength to maneuver Nolan onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His substantial weight nearly overwhelmed her petite frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she prepared to straighten up, a burning hand seized her wrist with surprising force</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The world tilted suddenly around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan dragged her down onto the mattress, trapping her beneath his fevered body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor found herself completely immobilized, while the jealousy that had been brewing over Trudy began rising to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly are you doing? How did it feel receiving such devoted care from the lovely Ms. White?&#34; she asked with bitter sarcasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lay with his eyes sealed shut,brow creased in obvious pain, his complexion flushed with unhealthy heat. He appeared to register her voice and mumbled incoherently, &#34;Eleanor... My Eleanor is the most beautiful woman alive. Don&#39;t worry yourself. Grandpa may be furious, but I promise everything will work out perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath scorched against her neck as his voice carried a plaintive note. &#34;But Eleanor, the pain is unbearable. A kiss would heal everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor pushed his head away with visible irritation.&#34;No way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet suddenly, Nolan&#39;s body went completely slack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt alarm spike through her as she quickly pressed her palm to his forehead. The temperature had climbed even higher than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to waste another moment, she immediately retrieved her needles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a comprehensive treatment session, Nolan&#39;s fever finally broke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely drained, Eleanor could barely maintain consciousness as she collapsed beside the bed,slipping into restless slumber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Eleanor jolted awake to Erick&#39;s frantic voice. &#34;Mr. Stewart! We have got a big  problem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced at Nolan, who remained unconscious on the bed, before leaving the master bedroom.&#34;What&#39;s the situation?&#34; she inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick delivered his urgent report. &#34;Last night, when Lilah escorted Ms. White from the apartment building,photographers captured everything. The images are spreading across the Internet rapidly! Countless online users are claiming, claiming that you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following a brief hesitation, Erick struggled to continue, &#34;They&#39;re suggesting that you, as the mistress, have stolen her rightful position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recalling Trudy&#39;s behavior as though she had already become Nolan&#39;s legitimate wife, Eleanor couldn&#39;t suppress a sound of annoyance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to acknowledge the strategy&#39;s cleverness, far more sophisticated than Lainey&#39;s previous attempts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, she considered this entirely irrelevant to her circumstances, since Nolan&#39;s complications remained his responsibility to address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today marked Enigma&#39;s flagship store launch in Elepdon, featuring new collections alongside a charitable initiative, keeping Eleanor extraordinarily occupied. She cast a glance toward the bedroom before striding purposefully headed down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simultaneously, she instructed Erick, &#34;Let Nolan handle the situation. Ready the car and escort me to the store.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond Enigma&#39;s flagship location in Elepdon, crowds gathered in dense clusters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Numerous fashion influencers and journalists had completely blocked the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Besty maintained composed supervision over the staff&#39;s final arrangements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor,wearing an impeccably cut white suit,stepped elegantly onto the stage&#39;s center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her announcement rang clearly. &#34;We appreciate everyone&#39;s unwavering support of Enigma Group. As our expression of gratitude, today&#39;s entire new collection will be offered at twenty percent below regular pricing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this declaration, the audience exploded into deafening applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Enigma, after all. Her creations typically remained beyond most people&#39;s reach, yet now they could not only purchase them, but at reduced prices?What a stroke of luck! Eleanor lifted her hand, gently gesturing for quiet,before sharing additional news. &#34;Additionally, today&#39;s complete proceeds will be contributed to the Elepdon Welfare Center in honor of each purchaser.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This announcement sent the crowd into renewed frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only could they acquire Enigma&#39;s usually unattainable designs at discounted rates, but they could do so while supporting charitable causes?Where else could such a perfect opportunity exist?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore,the moment Eleanor declared the opening,masses surged through the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The generous retail space quickly filled to capacity,bodies pressed together throughout.</p>
