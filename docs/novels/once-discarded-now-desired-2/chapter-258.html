                <p>Nolan and Wray were caught in a bitter rivalry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Norwood, with Hector at his side, went to meet Kieran White and his granddaughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Norwood arrived, Kieran greeted him with a warm smile. &#34;Norwood, at last! My coffee&#39;s almost cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood smiled, shaking his hand. &#34;Got held up on the way, old friend. I hope I didn&#39;t keep you waiting too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two elderly men exchanged a few warm words before they took their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s eyes soon landed on Trudy White, seated gracefully beside her grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With delicate features and a calm, refined air, Trudy radiated poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Norwood, she was far above Eleanor-who, in his eyes, was only a pretty face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan married Trudy, Norwood believed he would  finally settle down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, he offered her a warm smile.&#34;Trudy,you grow more graceful with each passing day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy lowered her gaze shyly, a soft smile playing on her lips. &#34;You flatter me, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her modesty pleased Norwood even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Kieran, he spoke directly. &#34;I&#39;ve come today on behalf of my unruly grandson, Nolan, to formally propose to your granddaughter, Trudy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both sides already knew the purpose of this meeting.Now the words were spoken aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy,who had long harbored feelings for Nolan,blushed at the proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran,too,was pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The White family did not hold as much sway in business as the Stewarts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An alliance through marriage would bring great advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he pretended to hesitate. &#34;Norwood, I&#39;ve heard Nolan is fond of someone. Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood gave a dismissive snort, his tone firm.&#34;That  woman is of no consequence. As heir to the Stewart family, Nolan doesn&#39;t get to decide his own marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Kieran needed to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set down his coffee cup with a smile. &#34;Since you put it that way, I have no reason to refuse. For Trudy,marrying into your family is an honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Norwood signaled Hector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector immediately pulled out a neatly prepared engagement agreement from his briefcase and placed it on the table with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s expression softened into satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here is the agreement. Please review it. If there are no issues, we&#39;ll consider the matter settled today.Next week is the Stewart Group&#39;s centennial celebration.I will announce their engagement before all our guests then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran read the document carefully several times. At last,satisfied,he nodded in approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the formalities complete, Norwood-whose health was not the strongest-took his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the room was left to just grandfather and granddaughter, Trudy&#39;s shyness slipped away. She tugged gently at Kieran&#39;s sleeve. &#34;Grandpa,shouldn&#39;t we ask for Nolan&#39;s opinion first? He&#39;s so attached to Eleanor Warren... Will he accept this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kieran&#39;s response mirrored Norwood&#39;s exactly. &#34;Men often keep casual women by their side, but they never matter. You will be Nolan&#39;s wife. As long as you hold your rightful place, the rest are nothing but distractions-easily removed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she heard her grandfather&#39;s words, Trudy&#39;s worries eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had both the time and the means to make Nolan hers-completely, in body and in heart.</p>
