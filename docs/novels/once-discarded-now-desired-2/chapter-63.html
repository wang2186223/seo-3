                <p>From that point on, Lainey&#39;s confidence only grew more inflated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within days, word had spread among nearly all the socialites in Elepdon that she had managed to snag Enigma&#39;s latest design.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a bar owned by the Brooks Group, Lillian caught wind of Lainey&#39;s obnoxious bragging before even spotting her in the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What rotten luck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Eleanor buried in her work and unable to hang out with her, Lillian had simply hoped for a quiet night out at her family&#39;s place. The last thing she expected was to cross paths with this pretentious woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any urge to unwind vanished instantly, and she made up her mind to slip out early.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey, ever observant, had already noticed Lillian&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Champagne in hand, she strolled over with a practiced elegance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Brooks,&#34; Lainey called smoothly, giving Lillian a quick scan before laying on the flattery. &#34;Do you enjoy Enigma&#39;s designs as well? If you&#39;re interested, I&#39;d be happy to connect you with Besty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She even tipped her chin upward at the end, clearly savoring her supposed upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nearly laughed out loud. As if she needed a favor from someone like Lainey to get her hands on Eleanor&#39;s work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian looked Lainey up and down, her gaze openly dismissive. &#34;Miss Gilbert, if my memory serves me correctly, our bar has always reserved entry only for Elepdon&#39;s old aristocracy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking her message-Lainey was out of place here. While Velvet Club stood as Elepdon&#39;s largest hotspot, the Brooks bar set the standard for exclusivity,reserved only for the VIP among VIPs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone like Lainey, or even Jonny, had no business making it past the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she was called out so directly, Lainey&#39;s fingers tightened around her glass, and a flash of annoyance crossed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Lillian wasn&#39;t swayed by sweet talk or intimidation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She counted on Enigma&#39;s status to pave the way, aiming to secure a connection to the Brooks family by winning Lillian over. Such a connection would have worked wonders for both the Todd Group and her own ambitions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Lillian was proving impossible to win over!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Darleen watched the exchange with growing irritation. &#34;She&#39;s my guest. What, are you planning to kick out guests now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She positioned herself between Lainey and Lillian.&#34;Don&#39;t get cocky just because your family&#39;s close with the Stewarts, Lillian. You don&#39;t get to walk all over the rest of us. Let me be clear, Lainey&#39;s with me, she&#39;s under my protection, and I won&#39;t let you push her around!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was desperate to impress Lainey, secretly hoping it would bring her closer to Besty as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen was fueled by that hope, and her voice took on a sharper edge.&#34;On top of that, Lainey isn&#39;t merely an acquaintance of Besty&#39;s-they&#39;re actually related, even if it&#39;s distant. So, what reason could you possibly have for saying she doesn&#39;t belong here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian nearly choked on her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had a real talent for spinning tall.tales, and Darleen was gullible enough to buy every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen&#39;s eagerness to cozy up to anyone useful had always grated on Lillian&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today felt like the perfect moment to teach Darleen a lesson about rules. With a playful grin, Lillian kicked up her foot onto a nearby chair and rolled up her sleeves. &#34;This is my family&#39;s territory. We decide who stays or goes. You&#39;re really willing to cross us just for Lainey&#39;s sake?&#34; She addressed Darleen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Brooks name carried real weight in Elepdon, ranked firmly among the top ten families. Even without the Stewarts,their influence was undeniable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In contrast, the Faulkner family barely scraped into the top fifty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second,uncertainty flickered across Darleen&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the thought of getting in Besty&#39;s good graces tempted her with visions of becoming the heir of the Faulkner family!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering her courage, Darleen replied, &#34;Ms. Brooks, there&#39;s no need for conflict. We&#39;re just here for a good time. Surely you wouldn&#39;t want people saying you kick out paying customers for no reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That last line carried a subtle warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian wasn&#39;t one to back down. Raised in privilege, she was used to getting her way, and idle threats meant nothing to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her hands on her hips and a mischievous spark in her eyes, she called out to the staff,&#34;Well,what are you standing around for? Show these troublemakers the ddoor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff wasted no time and quickly moved in to show Lainey and Darleen the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian, you&#39;ll pay for this! I won&#39;t forget.it!&#34; Darleen yelled.</p>
