                <p>Just as Nolan was about to step out the following morning, a single phone call shattered his plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time didn&#39;t wait for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction went on as scheduled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Eleanor arrived with Dyer&#39;s team, reporters rushed at them,thrusting microphones forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren, are the rumors true? Did you and Mr. Stewart break up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Mr.Stewart coming today? Are you still together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave a calm smile, her tone polite yeț distant. &#34;This is a private matter. I have nothing to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added gently, &#34;Please focus on today&#39;s auction. These artifacts deserve the spotlight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Security quickly stepped in, clearing the reporters and restoring order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall grew quiet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Eleanor&#39;s heart felt hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was used to standing alone, but somewhere along the way, she had begun hoping Nolan would stand beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would he come today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she took her seat beside Dyer in the front row, her eyes fell on the empty chair next to her-Nolan&#39;s name gleamed in gold on its card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction began, but the seat stayed vacant. He had broken his word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe because of Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor drew her gaze back to the auctioneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer, of course, noticed the shift in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned closer, muttering, &#34;Told you he&#39;s not right for you. Don&#39;t let it eat at you, kid. I&#39;ll find you someone better. Someone who&#39;ll make him look like yèsterday/&#39;s news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him a half-teasing look. &#34;Got time to play Cupid? Keep your eyes on those artifacts, or you&#39;ll be the one crying when they slip away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he heard her words, Dyer sat back, focusing on the bidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction ended on a high note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together,they secured several artifacts for the Elepdon Museum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when it came time to settle the bill, the staff revealed a surprise-an anonymous donor had already covered the enormous cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seven hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could possibly give that much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Eleanor and Dyer pondered, the museum&#39;s organizer approached with a wide smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Curtis, Ms. Warren, we&#39;ll be hosting a thank-you banquet in a few days. It would mean so much if you could attend. The community wants to honor you both.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer&#39;s grin widened, and he threw Eleanor a knowing glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A banquet like that would be full of wealthy young men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe one of them could help her forget Nolan. He agreed on the spot, and Eleanor, unwilling to appear rude, nodded along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows, Brodie watched with keen interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only come for amusement, but luck had handed him something better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A banquet meant fine wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he managed to slip something into her drinks, he could have his way with the elusive Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And marriage to her would secure his place among Elepdon&#39;s elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone sent a thrill through him. He could already picture walking her down the aisle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie whispered under his breath, &#34;Sorry, Nolan. Don&#39;t blame me for stealing your girl. You never knew how to keep her.&#34;</p>
