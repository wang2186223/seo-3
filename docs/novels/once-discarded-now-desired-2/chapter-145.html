                <p>Eleanor&#39;s brows drew together as she caught the sharp intensity in Jeff&#39;s eyes, though she schooled her face into cool indifference as she sat across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scrape of the chair seemed to snap Jeff from his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he dug into his pocket, drew out a check, and slid it across the table with a practiced hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren, let&#39;s not waste time,&#34; he said flatly. &#34;Here&#39;s $10 million. All I ask is that you tell the police it was a misunderstanding. Take it, and the matter ends here. If that figure isn&#39;t enough,name your price-we&#39;ll work something out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, it didn&#39;t matter who sat opposite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that mattered was Lainey&#39;s freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a girl so spoiled, so sheltered, survive behind prison walls?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor reclined lazily into her chair, not even sparing the check a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was Lainey&#39;s father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not impressive at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t even done the bare minimum of finding out who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really believe she could be bought off with ten million, like some cheap pawn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff was blind to the disdain flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mistook her silence for dissatisfaction with the amount, assuming she was holding out for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a greedy woman! &#34;Miss Warren, don&#39;t let greed cloud your judgment,&#34; he warned, his tone laced with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Eleanor let out a soft, amused laugh. &#34;Mr. Benton, tell me-did you even bother to review the surveillance footage with the police before coming here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he done so, he would never have dared to speak to her this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, Jeff hadn&#39;t looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if he couldn&#39;t bring himself to trust his own daughter, what right did he have to call himself her father?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened as he glared across the table, anger rising. &#34;The amount can change. That&#39;s notthe issue.What I want to know is simple-are you willing to negotiate with me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s laughter rang again, light and mocking, her eyes narrowing with playful curves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the sound faded, her expression snapped cold. &#34;No, Mr. Benton. I&#39;m not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have erupted at her blunt refusal, yet something in the effortless curve of her smile pulled him in,unsettling him in ways he hadn&#39;t expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His daughter had once smiled like that as a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Hilda had ever worn that same expression when joy filled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff blinked, disoriented, the face in front of him blurring until it overlapped with Hilda&#39;s in his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words tumbled out in a stammer.&#34;Who-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, the door burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan strode in, his expression set in grim lines. His gaze went straight to Eleanor, sweeping over her with sharp intensity until he confirmed she was unharmed. The rigid set of his jaw eased, the relief in his eyes unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unguarded concern sent a faint ripple through Eleanor&#39;s chest, something she couldn&#39;t quite name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still caught in the warmth of it when Nolan reached down, grasped her hand, and pulled her up from her chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; he said quietly, his voice low but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Eleanor break from her reverie, her steps falling in sync as she followed him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Jeff, it was a humiliation unlike any he had endured before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved himself up from his seat, palms slamming against the table, rage burning through him.&#34;You arrogant Stewart brat-how dare you walk out on me like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s fury shifted, lashing toward Eleanor now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept over her, hard and cold, and his words dripped with scorn.&#34;And you-don&#39;t think Nolan&#39;s protection gives you the right to run wild. You can afford to cross us. Once I get Lainey out, I&#39;ll make sure you regret this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stopped in her tracks, then slowly turned to face him. Her voice was calm, but every word struck sharp. &#34;Mr. Benton, your opinion of me means nothing. My rule is simple-l never pick a fight, but if one comes to me, I&#39;ll end it. Instead of wasting your breath threatening me, perhaps you should spend your energy keeping your daughter in line.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for his reply, she slipped her hand into Nolan&#39;s and walked out with him, not sparing Jeff another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Jeff&#39;s voice broke, his entire body shaking with fury, yet no words followed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The certainty in their demeanor gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Lainey really have done something wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His daughter had always been gentle, obedient.-There was no way she had crossed the line of the law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor must have set this trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding down his anger, Jeff steeled himself. He needed to call in favors, reach out to his connections,and make sure Lainey was treated with care inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought burning in his mind, he turned and strode out of the room.</p>
