                <p>Barely had Nolan begun to make his moves when the Todd Group&#39;s stock nosedived within days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, headlines everywhere screamed about the Todd family&#39;s impending collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her bedroom, Lainey sprawled across the sofa,a glass of red wine spinning lazily in her hand while her phone screen lit up her satisfied grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She congratulated herself for being one step ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well before Nolan struck back, she had already ordered Horace&#39;s men to snatch up Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the Todd family&#39;s name was drowning in public ridicule, and Emma had disappeared so cleanly that no one could dig up a single clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Nolan, with all his power, had nothing that tied back to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey allowed herself to breathe easy at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her phone, she tapped a familiar number without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the call went through, her voice melted into syrupy sweetness. &#34;Horace, I can&#39;t thank you enough. I&#39;ll always remember how much you&#39;ve done for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twirled a strand of hair around her finger, her tone sliding into something more cautious. &#34;But tell me, what about Emma? Are you sure you&#39;ve handled her the way l asked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Horace let out a rough, impatient chuckle.&#34;You still doubt me, you little fox? | shipped her off to the open sea just like you wanted, andl even rigged the DNA test. Now quit dancing around-when are you giving me the shares you promised?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Lainey&#39;s face faltered at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Fraser&#39;s meddling, she hadn&#39;t gotten her hands on any shares at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she didn&#39;t have them, she couldn&#39;t possibly hand anything over to Horace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also knew better than to reveal that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he learned she had no claim to the Benton family&#39;s assets, he might drop her altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, pretending to consider her options,though her heart was racing. &#34;It can&#39;t happen overnight. If I hand off a big chunk of shares right after securing them, people will start asking questions. And if they trace the deal back to you,that won&#39;t end well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace had never been the kind of man who could be easily tricked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After three long years of dealing with Lainey, he understood every shade of her cunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It better stay that way.&#34; His tone shifted abruptly,the warmth stripped away and replaced with an unspoken threat. &#34;If you ever think of going back on your word, you already know what happens next.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he ended the call, leaving dead silence behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s temper flared, and for a split second she almost hurled the phone across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; she hissed through clenched teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That filthy street rat had the audacity to threaten her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ought to be thankful she was giving him the shares. She was set to inherit the Benton legacy, a woman whose name alone would carry weight and earn respect from everyone in Elepdon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet some gang leader thought he had the right to negotiate with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her place in the Benton family was secured, she swore the first name on her list of enemies would be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lainey&#39;s anger ebbed and she sank toward  the bed, the faint creak of footsteps stirred the silence outside her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp jolt of unease shot through her, and she forced her breathing steady as she tossed the phone onto the sofa with deliberate ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds ticked by, yet no knock landed on her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, the sound drifted farther down the corridor,leading straight toward the master bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity pricked at her nerves, and she slid to the door, easing it open just enough to spy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There in the corridor, Jeff gripped a bulky brown envelope tight against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture screamed tension, his head snapping from side to side before he slipped into the master bedroom with haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes narrowed, and the corner of her mouth lifted ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff never carried himself like that unless he was guarding a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever lay inside that envelope had to be worth hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey made up her mind to trail after Jeff and find out for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no intention of letting his tricks blindside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, however, had no idea a pair of watchful eyes was fixed on his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, he was busy passing the envelope into his wife&#39;s hands, and she accepted it with a look of eager anticipation.</p>
