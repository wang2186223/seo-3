                <p>Emma&#39;s stomach dropped, panic flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could this be happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The piece had been authenticated by multiple experts-it couldn&#39;t be a forgery!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shoving aside anyone in her way, she stormed toward Eleanor, her voice rising. &#34;You must have stolen the real one! Otherwise, how would you know the exact details and call them out so quickly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her accusation could land, a booming laugh rolled across the gallery. &#34;That&#39;s quite the sharp eye you&#39;ve got, Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned toward the sound. Standing a short distance away was David himself, a broad smile stretching across his face. With a hand stroking his beard, he regarded Eleanor with playful admiration. &#34;Truth be told, I&#39;ve grown tired of the usual, predictable exhibitions. So l planted this forgery as a little test-a bit of fun for tonight.I never imagined you&#39;d spot it so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His revelation sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this had been David&#39;s doing all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given his reputation for being unpredictable and eccentric, perhaps it wasn&#39;t so surprising he would stage such a stunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience accepted David&#39;s words without hesitation, nodding along as if the matter was settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dyer wasn&#39;t about to let David enjoy the spotlight alone. He scoffed loudly, his tone laced with mockery. &#34;Hah! Just admit it, old man-you got duped by a forgery and now you&#39;re scrambling for a cover story. Lucky for you, Eleanor&#39;s got a sharper eye than you. Imagine if a buyer had spotted it after the sale-your so-called reputation would&#39;ve gone up in smoke!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David&#39;s face flushed crimson, his beard practically bristling in outrage. &#34;You decrepit relic! You&#39;ve got one foot in the grave and still wag that venomous tongue!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, in a sudden shift, he turned to Eleanor with an exaggerated pout, almost childlike. &#34;Eleanor, you saw it-this wrinkled fraud is smearing my name. You&#39;d better stand up for me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer bristled in return, jabbing a finger in David&#39;s direction. &#34;Don&#39;t let that old goat fool you, Eleanor!He&#39;s as stubborn as a mule and never admits when he&#39;s beaten!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help the small smile tugging at her lips as she watched the two of them bicker like quarrelsome schoolboys rather than the venerable masters they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some things about her teachers, she realized, would never change. Meanwhile, the spectators were left reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was baffling-two of the most legendary figures in the antiques world, sparring so familiarly with each other, and all while treating Eleanor with such casual warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the way they addressed her, it was obvious this connection ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma stood frozen, her mind reeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone like Eleanor-a woman with nothing but an orphanage to her name-possibly be on such familiar terms with Dyer and David, two titans whose word alone could shift the antiques world?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even her family struggled to get an audience with them.Unless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes suddenly widened as the thought struck her. She jabbed a finger at Eleanor, spitting venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shameless slut! My brother just tossed you aside, and now you&#39;re already crawling into Mr. Gill&#39;s bed? Do you have no dignity at all?&#34; Emma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence swallowed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the crowd-Emma really dared to say such a thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone here knew the truth: David and Dyer weren&#39;t just respected; they were living legends in the antiques circle, men revered like walking archives of history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To throw mud at David so brazenly... was Emma fearless, or simply brainless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lifted her chin, her gaze slicing through Emma with quiet contempt. &#34;Emma, you never fail to prove just how stupid you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The insult hit, and Emma snapped. &#34;Who are you calling stupid?&#34; she yelled, face flushed with outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor didn&#39;t give her the satisfaction of a pause.Her lips curled faintly as she added, &#34;Perhaps you&#39;ve forgotten-our little wager from earlier still stands, doesn&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
