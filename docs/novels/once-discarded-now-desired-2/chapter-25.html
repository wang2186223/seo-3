                <p>Erick caught the faint curve of a smile tugging at Nolan&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept hearing Ryland&#39;s whispers in the back of his mind, unable to shake them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible? Could it be that the unshakable Nolan was actually falling in love? Snapping back to reality,Erick quickly responded, &#34;I&#39;m on it, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By chance, the place chosen for their meeting happened to be a newly opened restaurant Jonny had mentioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The refined sign above the entrance caught Eleanor&#39;s eye, leaving her puzzled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would Nolan invite her without warning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she remembered how he had rescued her from  embarrassment at David&#39;s exhibition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since she owed him for that,paying the debt felt only fair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding onto that reminder, she straightened herself and stepped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was waiting by the window when she entered the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a plain white shirt with the sleeves loosely rolled, and there was a quiet elegance about him that stood apart from the lively chaos surrounding him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She approached with quiet poise. &#34;Mr. Stewart, with everything on your schedule, you still find time to have me here for this meal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice drew Nolan&#39;s gaze upward, his eyes carrying a flicker of interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle, unreadable smile formed as his dark eyes lingered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick received a brief glance from him, one loaded with unspoken meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the signal, Erick pulled a file from his briefcase and presented it with formal respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious, Eleanor extended her hand and opened the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face immediately clouded over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope House?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would Todd Group target such a place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The land was isolated and held little commercial promise,while relocation costs would be staggering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny would never come up with something this shortsighted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood Jonny better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Jonny, nothing mattered more than money and prestige.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tearing down an orphanage offered no real gain, only the risk of branding him as cruel and merciless. That very morning, Todd Group&#39;s internal networks exploded with chatter: Lainey had appeared out of nowhere, installed as Jonny&#39;s personal secretary, and placed in charge of the entire Usepsall project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no doubt that Lainey had been the one behind this!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, what puzzled her was Nolan&#39;s effort to make sure she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought pressing her, Eleanor asked him outright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s fingers slid idly along the edge of his glass,his tone calm and smooth. &#34;I simply value our connection, Miss Warren. And if you require assistance...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could continue, Eleanor snapped the folder shut, interrupting him. &#34;I appreciate it, Mr. Stewart,but I&#39;ll have to refuse your offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, every businessman had his own motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible for her to accept that Nolan&#39;s  motives were purely generous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her answer, Nolan made no attempt to argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting his glass aside, he drummed his fingers on the table and spoke in a measured tone. &#34;You&#39;ve been informed, Miss Warren. Handle it however you like. It&#39;s getting late-I&#39;ll head out now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got up from his seat and made his way out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following after him, Erick could hardly hide his confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All that trouble for a quick conversation with Eleanor -was that really the point?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they exited the restaurant, Nolan handed down more orders. &#34;Assign someone to watch her. Tell me the moment she makes a move. And for the Todd Group-pull out every bit of our investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick could foresee the fallout the Todd Group was about to face. &#34;Understood,Mr.Stewart.&#34; Out of everyone they could have challenged,the Todd Group chose the very person who had caught Nolan&#39;s attention. It was clear their days of standing strong were numbered.</p>
