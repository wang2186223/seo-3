                <p>With so many eyes and ears around, it didn&#39;t take long for word of what happened at the Todd famnily&#39;s villa to reach Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of being upset, she felt a rush of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jonny patched things up with Eleanor, that meant Nolan would be single, and all hers! Trading someone useless for a real catch felt like the ultimate win!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when she spotted Nolan&#39;s tall frame making his way into the banquet hall alone, her spirits soared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding up the elegant skirt of her designer dress, she strutted toward him. &#34;Nolan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was already in a foul mood after being ditched by Eleanor, and seeing Lainey, queen of manipulation,only made things worse, with his scowl deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he stepped aside, making sure to steer clear of her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Lainey stumbled, completely losing her balance, and ended up sprawled awkwardly on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests nearby let out a few stifled laughs, unable to hide their amusement, though none dared to do it openly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, on the other hand, didn&#39;t bother hiding her reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arms folded and an unimpressed look, she scoffed, &#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t the star of the evening. What&#39;s wrong, Lainey? Isn&#39;t having a husband enough for you? Or are you so desperate that you have to chase after someone else&#39;s boyfriend just because his girIfriend isn&#39;t here? That&#39;s downright disgraceful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her blunt words left Lainey completely exposed, her pride shattered in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage burned inside Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She,however, had changed. Gone was the version of the timid girl from before. In the past, she would have been forced to swallow Lillian&#39;s insults.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, as the Benton family&#39;s only daughter, why should she tolerate any of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze grew cold, and she braced herself to fire back, until she caught sight of Jeff and Hilda making their way over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Immediately, all traces of anger disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes, and she let them spill over.&#34;Ms. Brooks, I know you&#39;ve never been fond of me.But today marks my official return to my family. Even if you can&#39;t stand me, did you really have to humiliate me in front of everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as her voice broke, Jeff arrived by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting his daughter looking utterly defeated, he rushed to help her up, worry written all over his face.&#34;Sweetheart, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to keep her composure, Lainey wiped her tears and forced a gentle smile. &#34;Dad, really, it&#39;s nothing.1don&#39;t blame Ms. Brooks for anything. I&#39;m probably just difficult to be liked. Please, don&#39;t take it out on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Lainey&#39;s gentle nature on display, willing to defend the very person who had hurt he, even after being humiliated, Jeff felt a surge of pride and frustration. Her patience was admirable, but in his eyes,nobody had the right to mistreat his beloved daughter this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gave Lainey&#39;s hand a reassuring squeeze and let out a weary sigh. &#34;You&#39;re far too forgivingfor your own good. You can&#39;t just let others treat you however they want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda, on the other hand, barely glanced at Lainey. Her gaze remained locked on Lillian,her expression soft yet unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Lainey targeting this girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she dislike her for some reason?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe there was something more to it... But after she watched Lillian closely for a while, Hilda&#39;s hope faded. She didn&#39;t resemble her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the child she had lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even all grown up, her own daughter would still look like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian shifted uncomfortably under Hilda&#39;s intense gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lillian finally got a good look at Hilda&#39;s face, she grew even more confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this Lainey&#39;s birth mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she resemble Eleanor so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance wasn&#39;t exact, but their eyes were uncannily similar.</p>
