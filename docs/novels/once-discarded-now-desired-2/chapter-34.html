                <p>The unrest shaking Jonny&#39;s shareholders hadn&#39;t happened naturally-it had been carefully seeded by Nolan working behind the curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, whether those shares were dumped or held tightly, the choice was Nolan&#39;s to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His long fingers drummed lightly on the table before he turned to Erick and spoke in a low command.&#34;Buy out half of the shareholders. Leave the rest where they are. I&#39;ll need them to keep making noise inside the Todd Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos within the company was a weapon he intended to use again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And there was the personal angle-Jonny had once been Eleanor&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tie alone guaranteed Nolan would never truly let Jonny walk free of his shadlow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How far the storm went would depend entirely on Jonny&#39;s own moves. If he kept blundering, he would be digging his own grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Erick left to handle the task, Nolan did what he always did-he reached for his phone and sent Eleanor a message. &#34;I may have a gift for you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The power to flip control of the Todd Group like it was nothing more than a chess piece-that was a gift with real weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jonny ever dared to push Eleanor past her limit, Nolan would hand those very shares to her without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he didn&#39;t put any of that in writing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mystery was part of his armor, and he wore it well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Eleanor stared at the message, puzzled by its meaning. Her pen stilled on the page, and she absently pressed the tip against her lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, she decided, had far too much time on his hands, and with that thought dismissed, she bent over her sketch again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the launch of Enigma Group so close, she needed designs that could turn heads and pull in investors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without those funds, making a bold move would be impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what mattered now? The work in front of her, not some man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next day, Nolan still hadn&#39;t received a reply from Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet irritation never crossed his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience, after all, was part of the game. In time, he would succeed in peeling back every layer of Eleanor until her true self was laid bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very idea tugged a smile to his lips, one he struggled to suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland, standing nearby, shuddered. &#34;Nolan, for God&#39;s sake, stop smiling like that. It&#39;s creepy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing a man with a reputation for cold indifference suddenly wearing a tender smile was enough to send chills down anyone&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan shot Ryland a cold look. &#34;Too much free time? I&#39;ve got a project in some remote corner of the map you might want to handle...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold it, stop right there!&#34; Ryland cut inimmediately, waving his hands. &#34;I was only joking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s words made his scalp prickle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who in their right mind would want to work in some remote corner of the map?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Certainly not the CEO of Brooks Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only Nolan kept insisting those far-flung sites were worth attention, trying to rope him into going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No chance-he wasn&#39;t taking the bait. &#34;Actually, I just remembered I&#39;ve got urgent business,&#34; Ryland blurted, backing toward the door. &#34;I&#39;ll leave you to your smiling. Enjoy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ryland slipped out, Erick returned and stopped before Nolan. &#34;Mr. Stewart, everything&#39;s been taken care of. But there&#39;s one matter that needs your decision. Enigma Group in Vladena has just sent us their proposal.Should we consider investing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewart Group&#39;s investment team was known for its precision and skill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ordinarily, no project reached Nolan&#39;s desk until it had gone through their full evaluation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Enigma Group wasn&#39;t an ordinary case. Its reputation alone gave it weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The risk was clear-by the time the usual assessments were finished, Enigma Group might no longer need outside capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting such a profitable opportunity slip away would be a mistake Stewart Group couldn&#39;t afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On top of that, Enigma Group stood as a direct rival to the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Stewart Group poured money into Enigma Group, the announcement itself could shake Todd Group&#39;s foundation before the real fight even began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick leaned on that final point, making sure it landed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze sharpened, a faint gleam of amusement breaking through his cool exterior. &#34;Invest. And don&#39;t stop there-secure the position of largest shareholder.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to see if Jonny would have the strength left to keep pestering Eleanor once the tide turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, Eleanor would end up owing him another debt-whether she realized it or not.</p>
