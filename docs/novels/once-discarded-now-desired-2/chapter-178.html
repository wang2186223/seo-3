                <p>About half an hour later, a Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of the Podium Apartments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor unbuckled her seatbelt and gave Fraser a polite nod. &#34;Thanks for the ride, Mr. Benton,&#34; she said softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser returned a gentle smile. &#34;No problem. Glad to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he noticed her slightly reserved air, his expression softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; he said, &#34;my mom isn&#39;t very good with directions. She tends to get lost if she&#39;s out alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused, a flutter stirring in her chest at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together, then decided to speak. &#34;About Mrs. Benton...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser turned his head toward her, his eyes clear behind the gold-rimmed glasses. &#34;No need to explain.I trust you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused for a moment with her hand on the car door, then whispered her farewell and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she steadied herself, a familiar purple roadster skidded in and came to a dramatic stop beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flung open, and Lillian stepped out, her heels clicking energetically as she strode over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! You&#39;re finally back!&#34; she exclaimed, her eyes immediately darting toward the Rolls-Royce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For just a second, her face lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh wow, it&#39;s him again,&#34; she thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever he was, she would charm him first and worry about the rest later. Letting go of Eleanor&#39;s arm, she moved closer to the car, leaned on the door with one hand,and bent slightly to give him a playful whistle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, hello there. Fancy meeting you here. How about a drink?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was bold, and completely unrestrained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor groaned quietly, pinching the bridge of her nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was perfectin so many ways, but when it came to a good-looking man, she couldn&#39;t help herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser, seated inside, raised an eyebrow at the bold display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vibrant young woman in front of him was Lillian, a member of the Brooks family and Eleanor&#39;s college roommate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the information he had gathered, she was bold and always shielded those close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only met her briefly before, and he had to admit that she lived up to her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He probably should have ignored her forward approach, but it was actually a good chance to learn more about Eleanor&#39;s life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle smile formed as he studied her over his glasses. &#34;Sure,&#34; he replied, keeping his voice calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grin that spread across Lillian&#39;s face was instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dashed off to park her car, then came bouncing back, hopping straight into the passenger seat as if nothing could slow her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before driving off, she threw Eleanor a cheeky look. &#34;My beautiful Eleanor! Looks like tonight&#39;s all yours!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasn&#39;t sure whether to laugh or cry at her friend&#39;s antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the end of the night, Lillian got nothing out of her little stunt, and she ended up utterly drunk instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser didn&#39;t fare any better. He had hoped to sneak some details about Eleanor&#39;s past from Lillian, but she kept rambling about how much she respected Eleanor and how she was rooting for her and Nolan. Not exactly the intel he had wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit reassured knowing Lillian genuinely cared about Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loosening his tie, Fraser got out of the car,the scent of alcohol strong around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver hurried out to help him. &#34;Sir, be careful,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser waved him off, insisting he was fine, even though each step wobbled slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he rubbed his forehead and headed toward the villa, movement in the shadows caught his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly alert, he froze. Something wasn&#39;t right. He gave a sharp nod to the head of security behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get them,&#34; he commanded.</p>
