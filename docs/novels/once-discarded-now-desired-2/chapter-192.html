                <p>As Nolan walked back to the hospital, a faint hint of cruelty lingered around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp intensity of his presence made the bodyguards at the end of the hallway straighten instinctively, though their eyes kept flicking toward the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan suddenly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had something happened to Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone made his blood run cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t allow himself to linger on it. With a sharp movement, he pushed open the ward door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was awake, leaning slightly against the headboard,while Hilda was sitting beside her, gently feeding her soup. Hearing the door, Eleanor turned her head. Her eyes met Nolan&#39;s, and she noticed the worried look on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her delicate brows lifted in curiosity. &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her voice, Nolan&#39;s tension eased, and he drew in a steadying breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing,&#34; he replied smoothly, though his gaze lingered on Hilda with polite detachment. &#34;Mrs.Benton, when did you get here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda was one of the few people he allowed near Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He trusted her because she genuinely cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by his earlier intensity, Hilda took a deep breath and composed herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the soup bowl down and offered a gentle smile. &#34;I just got here a little while ago,&#34; she said softly. &#34;Seeing Eleanor safe is a relief.&#34; With a meaningful glance at Eleanor, Hilda added,&#34;You two talk. I&#39;ll take my leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Hilda quietly left, the room fell back into silence,leaving just Eleanor and Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Eleanor&#39;s curiosity won out. &#34;Who did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had caught bits of his earlier conversation while half-asleep, and from what she had heard, he had already gone to handle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pulled up a chair beside her bed, his expression serious. &#34;It was Emma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s brows creased slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, the pampered fool of the Todd family, was good for nothing except picking on others. Could she really be behind something so sinister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replayed the events in her mind. The anonymous warning about Myah fainting, followed by the speeding truck aimed directly at her. Everything pointed to a carefully designed trap meant to end her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Emma? Really?&#34; Eleanor&#39;s tone was doubtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t believe it either,&#34; Nolan admitted, his tone sharpening. &#34;There&#39;s definitely someone pulling the strings behind her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze softened as he looked at her pale,tired face. &#34;I&#39;ve already sent people to investigate thoroughly.You just rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leave everything else to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded, choosing not to overextend herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a danger she could trust him to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He adjusted the blanket around her shoulders before leaving the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the bodyguards stood stiffly at attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in Nolan&#39;s face vanished as he turned serious again. He called over one of his most trusted men and held out two strands of hair he had collected.&#34;Take these to my private doctor,&#34; he instructed quietly. &#34;Run a DNA test. Discreetly. No one else can know. Just you and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so many outsiders coming into Elepdon lately,Nolan couldn&#39;t be certain which hospital staff might be compromised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any DNA test had to be completely reliable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently hoped the results would give him the clarity he needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard, understanding the gravity of the order , nodded without hesitation. &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
