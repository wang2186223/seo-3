                <p>Lainey had no time to worry about Vickie&#39;s complaints, because her own world was starting to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she glanced at Vickie&#39;s message than a new notification popped up on her screen-a video from an unlisted number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The recording opened with her sliding into a cafébooth, Denny seated across from her like nothing was amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next came the image of her hand pulling strands of hair from a sealed plastic bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final shot showed her slipping into the restroom,eyes sharp as she spied on Denny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every second of the footage was sharp, leaving no room for denial. Her phone slipped from her fingers and hit the floor with a heavy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s face went pale as she clutched her mouth in horror. No... how was this possible? Where did this come from?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night replayed in her mind-she had personally watched the manager erase the surveillance and even sweetened the deal with a thick envelope of cash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what if someone had copied it before the deletion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if there had been eyes on her the entire time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more her thoughts unraveled, the colder she felt,fear spreading through her veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, her identity as a Benton was the only weapon she had left, the only card that could secure her place again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing that meant losing everything. Lainey grabbed the phone off the floor, struggling to calm the tight rhythm of her breath. Her hands trembled as she punched in the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this? What do you even want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reply landed almost instantly. &#34;My identity doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is I know exactly what you did. Hand over five percent of the Benton Group&#39;s shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened. Five percent. Again. She had already promised Horace five, and now another five?That was ten percent of the company&#39;s worth. Tens of billions slipping right through her fingers before she even had the chance to hold them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny&#39;s words from earlier echoed in her mind-twenty percent. That was supposed to be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, before she even got the chance to hold onto them, half had already slipped through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t sit right with her. No matter how she tried to reason with it, she just couldn&#39;t make peace with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But refusal wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teeth sank into her lower lip until she nearly drew blood, and she forced her trembling hand to type a single word.&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her heart, however, she made a vow. Once she secured her place as Benton blood, she would hunt this person down and make them regret crossing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly sent another message, saying, &#34;Give me your name and your bank account details. I&#39;ll arrange the transfer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was clear-learn who they were, then erase them completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response was just as cold as the last. &#34;Who l am doesn&#39;t matter. When you see your family again that night, make sure the transfer papers are signed. And don&#39;t get any ideas. If you try to be smart, the Bentons will see this video before the night&#39;s over.&#34; As her eyes stayed fixed on the screen, the weight of the message shattered what little calm Lainey had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scream tore through the room as she hurled the phone against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Damn it! Why does Eleanor glide through life while every step I take feels like walking into a trap?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she had no choice but to charm the Benton family into granting her back the ten percent she had just given away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny had told her the family would return in a week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gave her seven days to become the ideal daughter they longed for-sweet, attentive,irreplaceable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she succeeded, the shares would fall into her hands willingly, and she wouldn&#39;t have to claw for them piece by piece in the years ahead.</p>
