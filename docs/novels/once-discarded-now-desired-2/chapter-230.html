                <p>Nothing else mattered as Eleanor&#39;s gaze swept frantically across the burning hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flames clawed their way up the once-elegant wallpaper, while sparks rained down from the teetering chandelier overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the smoky haze, she finally caught sight of two figures huddled by the toppled sofa-Hilda and Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic squeezed her chest, but she pushed forward without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief flooded her when she saw their chests rise and fall-they were still alive, only overwhelmed by the thick, choking smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to rest. She glanced desperately at the main doors, but they were sealed off by a pile of beams and a wall of fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced for ariother way out, and then she spotted the back door. The flames had not reached it yet,and hope sparked in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting on instinct, Eleanor crouched down and hooked her arms under both Hilda and Jeff, fighting to lift them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their combined weight nearly brought her to her knees, but she refused to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Step by step, teeth gritted, she inched forward, carefully weaving around the flames licking at her shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A burnt beam smashed to the floor right behind her, showering sparks everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Eleanor realized just howN close she had come to disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her pulse hammered in her chest, fear threatening to take over, but she forced herself to keep moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every wall around her shuddered as the whole house groaned, splintering wood echoing through the smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline took over and Eleanor pushed herself to go faster. Just as she made for the back exit, three shadowy figures appeared, blocking the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men in dark suits stood shoulder to shoulder, faces blank, offering no way past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out on the street, a sleek black Bentley waited just beyond the police barricade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan threw the door open and sprinted toward the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flames devoured the villa in front of him, turning his face pale with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A massive explosion thundered through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house caved in with a terrible roar, and for an instant, it felt like the entire world held its breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan froze in place, every muscle tensed as dread overtook his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shouted her name, voice cracking with panic. &#34;Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he tried to bolt toward the burning house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick and the nearby security guards caught up just in time to stop him, grabbing his arms and pulling him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, you can&#39;t go in there-it&#39;s too dangerous!&#34; Erick said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A lady just ran inside and hasn&#39;t come back out. You can&#39;t throw your life away!&#34; one guard pleaded, trying to reason with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wild desperation took over as Nolan&#39;s eyes reddened and he screamed at the top of his lungs,&#34;Open the way! I have to go in! Please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Eleanor was trapped inside made the&#39;panic nearly unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be scared out of her mind, all alone in that burning house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thrashing grew so violent that the guards nearly lost their grip, barely managing to restrain him as he fought with everything he had. Erick&#39;s eyes glistened with tears as he watched his boss unravel. Knowing he had no other choice, he gritted his teeth and knocked Nolan out. &#34;Forgive me, sir. This is for your own good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a fleet of sleek Maybachs rolled up to the edge of the police blockade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doors swung open and Norwood stepped out, flanked by a group of attendants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s eyes immediately landed on an unconscious Nolan. A hint of relief crossed Norwood&#39;s face at the sight of Nolan unscathed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That relief faded fast as he took in the Benton estate, now nothing but flames and ashes. For a brief moment, his eyes narrowed-if Nolan had made it inside, he might never have come back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s tone left no room for argument as he addressed the butler. &#34;Take him home.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, sir!&#34;</p>
