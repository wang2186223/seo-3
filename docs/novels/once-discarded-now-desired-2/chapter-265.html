                <p>When darkness settled, light rain began falling, and the air grew colder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy lingered in the corridor, quietly watching the man confined in the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had remained on his knees there for ten long hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His suit clung to his back, soaked in blood, forming a ghastly picture beneath the faint glow. After enduring fifty lashes, he never let out a single cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man proved even more unyielding than she had believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His indomitable pride and raw endurance awakened a sharper craving inside her-possessiveness burning hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harder he was to break, the sweeter the triumph of mastering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector arrived from behind. &#34;Ms. White,&#34; he said. &#34;Mr.Stewart wishes Nolan to be entrusted to you.&#34; Trudy inclined her head slightly. &#34;I understand. Thank you for helping, Hector.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she lifted her skirt and moved elegantly into the basement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,why subject yourself to this?&#34;she asked softly.&#34;I already pleaded with Norwood, and his anger subsided. Allow me to bring you back for rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy extended her hand toward Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant her fingers touched his skin, the burning heat shocked her, and she jerked back in alarm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he feverish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes,illness rendered any man weakest. This offered the perfect chance for closeness to blossom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching her teeth, Trudy guided Nolan&#39;s arm over her shoulder and summoned all her strength to raise him.&#34;Come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, at that moment, had come back to Podium Apartments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah helped remove her coat, speaking anxiously &#34;Erick mentioned that Mr. Stewart visited his grandfather early this morning and still hasn&#39;t returned.&#34; Eleanor knitted her brow, reaching for her phone,  when the sound of the electronic lock clicked at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, the apartment door flew open</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy stumbled inside, supporting Nolan&#39;s weight</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tall frame sagged against her, his face ashen, his eyes shut-he had collapsed entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s pupils shrank as she rushed forward to take him from Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body radiated frightening heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her palm to his forehead, frowning deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had his fever risen so suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And those bloodied bandages across his back... what exactly had happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy stood aside, smoothing her loosened hair before speaking with a courteous smile. &#34;Miss Warren,there&#39;s no need to worry. Nolan&#39;s condition isn&#39;t grave.Before bringing him here, I had someone bind his wounds and give him medicine for the fever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor said nothing, guiding Nolan steadily toward the room. Trudy, unfazed by the cold shoulder, allowed her voice to trail pleasantly after her. &#34;Miss Warren, I appreciate you caring for Nolan tonight. Once he and I marry, I&#39;ll certainly repay such kindness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assumingthe stance of Nolan&#39;s bride-to-be, she declared imperiously. &#34;But Regal Heights belongs only to each Stewart head and their partner.Please make sure you don&#39;t leave anything there; otherwise tongues may wag.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor halted briefly, tilting her head so her frosty gaze met Trudy&#39;s face. &#34;Ms. White,perhaps you speak too soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned back, her tone utterly flat. &#34;Lilah, escort our guest outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah, long irritated by Trudy, she replied instantly,&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a stern look, she motioned for Trudy to leave.&#34;Please,Ms.White.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though irritation surged within her, Trudy&#39;s expression stayed composed as she exited gracefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she intended for Nolan to remain at the Stewart family&#39;s estate, sharing quarters to seal their bond. However, Nolan insisted on returning to Podium Apartments,refusing any other option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no alternative but to escort him here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it hardly mattered; plenty of time lay ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she officially became Nolan&#39;s wife, countless means existed to handle unwelcome rivals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping outside, Trudy glanced toward the corner where a planted reporter waited and offered a subtle nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reporter instantly caught on and gave a confirming nod in return.</p>
