                <p>Jeff&#39;s earlier strike had successfully kept Wray subdued for several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, through Wray&#39;s unpredictable maneuvers, the Stewart Group managed to regain stability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the president&#39;s office, he lounged in a wide leather chair, one leg folded over the other, smugly humming a clumsy tune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, the Benton family wasn&#39;t as intimidating as people claimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had overestimated Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While savoring his apparent victory, a sudden knock came at the office door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive known for constant flattery burst in,nearly tripping over his shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, we got a problem. All our business associates in Zerovia abruptly canceled every partnership with us! Worse still, a shipment already dispatched there has been seized at Customs by the military!&#34; the executive said breathlessly. Wray&#39;s smug grin vanished immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The military?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had soldiers become involved in this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprang to his feet, seized the executive&#39;s collar,and barked, &#34;Repeat that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terrified by Wray&#39;s violent temper, the executive stammered through the details once more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finished with, &#34;The military insists the cargo hides contraband, so it must remain under indefinite inspection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Wray&#39;s strength deserted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip fell away, and he collapsed heavily into the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was collapsing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such staggering losses could never escape the board&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This smelled of Nolan&#39;s schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could Nolan command Zerovia&#39;s military so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When businessmen collided with the military, it felt like fighting pistols against knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frozen in place, unable to act, he saw Brodie stroll inside with effortless compoosure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s eyes settled on Wray&#39;s ashen face, a sly smile tugging at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like trouble found you?&#34; Brodie&#39;s tone carried no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray snapped irritably. &#34;If you came only to mock me,then leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie chuckled, waving the executive away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the office held only the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out a chair opposite Wray, Brodie calmly poured himself a cup of coffee. &#34;I happen to hold some sway in Zerovia too,&#34; he said lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s eyes brightened. &#34;You can fix this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sipping leisurely, Brodie answered, &#34;I can. But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Wray demanded, &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting down his cup, Brodie casually brushed back his hair.&#34;The CFO&#39;s position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That demand made Wray&#39;s brows crease. The Chief Financial Officer seat carried immense weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single mistake from the Chief Financial Officer could spark a devastating financial collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If failure struck, neither Norwood nor the board would ever forgive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, faced with Zerovia&#39;s disaster, Wray wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a solution, he would lose his current job and even get kicked out of the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching his uncertainty, Brodie pressed harder. &#34;You honestly think you can survive without me? You&#39;ve seen Nolan&#39;s power today. He could bring you down effortlessly. Joining forces with me is your only escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray knew those words held truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t allow Nolan to triumph!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never again would he live beneath another&#39;s control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Chief Financial Officer seat belonged to someone loyal to him and Brodie, draining money from the Stewart Group would be far simpler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together they could outmaneuver Nolan, even Norwood. Then the entire empire would fall into their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resolved,Wray declared, &#34;Deal!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s grin widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose, extended his hand, and said, &#34;Here&#39;s to our first successful partnership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray clasped it firmly. &#34;Looking forward to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Wray launched his counteroffensive with Brodie beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Regal Heights villa, inside the study, Erick delivered his report. &#34;Mr. Stewart, Wray installed a new CFO, one of Brodie&#39;s allies. Also, Brodie pulled strings in Zerovia, and Customs already released the shipment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tapped slender fingers against the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every piece fell exactly where he had planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fool Wray lacked the composure to endure pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan felt pleased, convinced it was wiser to draw out hidden vermin in one sweep rather than hunt them individually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips lifted faintly, though his gaze held not a trace of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said, &#34;Leave them alone. It&#39;s time we advance to the next stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran through Erick. He bowed quickly.&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
