                <p>After scanning McCollum&#39;s message, Nolan let out a low laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was the type to never accept being taken advantage of-not even for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t a pushover; she hunted in silence, waiting patiently for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That resilience of hers always left him satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace was brazen to think he could meddle with his girl and get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaiden,noticing Nolan slip his phone into his pocket,stepped forward with deference. &#34;Mr. Stewart, all preparations are complete. Our team will attend the event posing as members of the Zerovia Chamber of Commerce.They&#39;ll be ready to act at your command.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, chilling smile touched Nolan&#39;s lips, though his eyes stayed hard as steel. &#34;I&#39;ll be there myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news made Kaiden stiffen,sweat prickling his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s safety was a matter of national concern. If anything ever happened to him, Zerovia&#39;s entire economy could spiral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But arguing with him was out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Kaiden could do was silently double and triple their security-determined that nothing, absolutely nothing would go wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan found himself genuinely intrigued by what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but picture Eleanor draped in the traditional ceremonial attire of this country-curious to see how she would look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Eleanor sat perfectly still, her body limp and compliant as the women around her fussed with pins and layers of fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed at her own reflection, her face a mask of resignation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman staring back from the mirror looked almost unrecognizable-her skin thick with powder,garish streaks of blush smeared across her cheeks,eyelids painted in jarring colors as if shewere about to take the stage in some tragic farce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maids around her gasped and gushed, voices full of exaggerated praise. &#34;Absolutely stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks just like a goddess!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips twitched in a half-hearted attempt at a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed like this, she doubted even Myah would know who she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she drifted in her thoughts, a familiar figure wove quietly through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCollum had arrived, slipping into the chaos as if he belonged there. He caught Eleanor&#39;s eye and gave her the briefest nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle relief washed over Eleanor, her anxious heart growing just a little lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pair of maids helped her stand and gently steered her toward the bustling front hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scarlet gown swept behind her, long and weighty,shimmering with gold thread and studded jewels-every inch radiating extravagant wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she neared McCollum, she slowed, speaking so  softly only he could hear, saying, &#34;If anything goes wrong, find Horace&#39;s wife,Darlene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, McCollum&#39;s eyes grew sharper, then the mask returned. He dipped his head, his tone serious. &#34;You watch your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,taking advantage of the commotion, McCollum pressed a small dagger into Eleanor&#39;s palm, his movement quick and unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The icy blade sent a chill through her fingers,but she accepted it without hesitation. She might need it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the front hall, the festivities were already roaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise was deafening-voices, laughter, and clinking glasses shook the old beams overhead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men with flushed cheeks toasted Horace, hollering over the music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet that Stewart kid is about ready to explode by now!&#34; one shouted, and the crowd roared its agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Anyone who tries to go toe-to-toe with Horace ought to know he&#39;s playing with fire!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole crowd erupted in laughter, sharing in Horace&#39;s moment of glory. Horace tipped back his glass, draining it in one long pull, a cocky grin plastered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signaled to his right-hand man with a sweeping gesture. &#34;Once this ceremony&#39;s done, send Mr.Stewart a lavish gift. He deserves to hear the good news firsthand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t just a taunt anymore-it was a direct challenge,meant to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Kaiden sat stiffly at his table, casting a wary glance at the man beside him, sweat beading along his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sat utterly still, tapping the table in a slow,steady rhythm-his face as unreadable as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kaiden knew that the quieter Nolan seemed,the more dangerous things had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace had no idea what kind of storm he had just summoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, someone&#39;s voice rose above the din, cutting through the laughter. &#34;Here comes Miss Warren!&#34;</p>
