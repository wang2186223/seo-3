                <p>Lainey stood by, her gaze hard and victorious as she watched the Brooks siblings disappear dejectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost all of Jeff&#39;s personal fortune, and his wife&#39;s now belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans for her engagement to Nolan were already in motion, thanks to Norwood&#39;s efforts. Their engagement party was only days away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every goal she had set her sights on was finally within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she married into the Stewart family, she would make the Brooks family pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft vibration interrupted her thoughts. Her phone flashed with a message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darleen Faulkner is awake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey nearly lost her.composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen? Wasn&#39;t that girl supposed to be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life? How could she suddenly come back from the brink?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a problem, a serious one. Jaw tight, Lainey clenched her fists, steeling herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have to take care of Darleen before secrets started to slip out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some truths needed to stay buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few strategic tears later, Lainey wrapped up the press conference and strode straight to her waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hospital. Now,&#34; she ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, Miss Gilbert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lillian sat quietly in the Maybach, her anger simmering. Watching Lainey bask in her victory,Lillian struggled to hold back tears. With Eleanor out of the picture, Lainey basked in the glow of her victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was weighed down by the thought that she wasn&#39;t even capable of standing up for her best friend and fighting for justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland fired up the engine, glancing at his sister in the rearview mirror. &#34;Don&#39;t lose hope just yet. We&#39;ll go to the Stewarts&#39; first and see what Nolan intends to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had vanished into his room after yesterday&#39;s chaos, refusing food, water, or company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t like him. It felt like the story wasn&#39;t over yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t shown any reaction to the press conference that day, and that was highly out of character for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chance for things to take a different turn might still be waiting ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the siblings reached the Stewart family&#39;s residence, they discovered Nolan seated alone in the room, his expression drenched in quiet despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was draped in a stark white outfit, the air of authority that usually surrounded him nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of sorrow washed over Lillian, so she tugged gently on Ryland&#39;s sleeve, urging him to speak for both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t trust her own voice, not when tears threatened to spill at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland drew in a steadying breath and addressed Nolan, his words quiet but clear. &#34;Nolan, Lainey&#39;s taken over the Benton family.Everyone can see her ambitions are out of control. What do we do now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Nolan said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes opened slowly, dark and unreadable, as if nothing could touch him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two days from now, there&#39;s going to be a funeral for the Bentons. We will send someone to settle the engagement date. Lainey&#39;s about to become the official heiress,&#34; Nolan responded, voice devoid of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock and outrage crashed through Lillian. She broke away from Ryland and rushed toward Nolan, her voice shaking with pain. &#34;Nolan, how can you be so cold? It&#39;s barely been a day since Eleanor&#39;s gone! Are you really going to marry the woman who destroyed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland jumped forward to pull his sister back, worry etched on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about this didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew Nolan. If Eleanor had truly died, Nolan would have torn the city apart by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he would just agree to get engaged to Lainey without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unless Eleanor was still alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe everything Nolan was doing was an elaborate act to soothe Lainey into a false sense of victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he wanted her so convinced of her own success that she wouldn&#39;t see her downfall coming until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Ryland considered it, the more convinced he became that the truth was close at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With fresh resolve, he took Lillian by the arm, guiding her out before she could cause any more of a scene.&#34;Nolan,I understand now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stumbled behind her brother, bewildered. &#34;What do you get? Ryland, what do you mean? Please, just tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices faded as they disappeared down the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in the room, Nolan closed his eyes once more and whispered under his breath, &#34;Eleanor,I promise, I&#39;Il make sure Lainey pays for everything she&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
