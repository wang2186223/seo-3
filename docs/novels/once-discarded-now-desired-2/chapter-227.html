                <p>Hilda lit up as soon as she heard Eleanor was getting engaged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the morning of the engagement party, she was already awake before the sun had a chance to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She floated from one room to the next, straightening her gown, then hurrying to check the gift she had wrapped herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff watched her move about, a soft smile playing at his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes landed on a small velvet box sitting open on the table, revealing a diamond bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was an heirloom, something that had been part of the Wagner family for as long as anyone could remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s mother had once handed one to each of her daughters, many years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff recalled how much Hilda treasured hers. Most days, she kept it tucked away, only bringing it out for the rarest occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over and slipped an arm around her shoulders. &#34;Sweetheart, even if Eleanor&#39;s your brother&#39;s daughter, isn&#39;t this a little over the top?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda snapped the box shut and shot him a look. &#34;Over the top? You think this is too much? Eleanor is getting engaged, Jeff. If anything, I&#39;m worried it&#39;s not enough! Today is about her, so please, let&#39;s not say anything to dampen the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could, Hilda would have given Eleanor the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff just grinned and squeezed her shoulder, deciding it was best not to argue with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it brought her happiness, that was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had left early that morning, which turned out to be a blessing. If she had witnessed this moment, she probably would have read too much into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda decided it was time to get ready and headed upstairs to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, the front door swung open to reveal a man in a crisp black suit. He stood with a stiff posture, his face unfamiliar-Hilda figured he must bethe new driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.and Mrs. Benton, the car is waiting out front,&#34; the man said with respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff was lost in his thoughts and didn&#39;t bother looking back. &#34;Alright,&#34; he replied without much interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden, sharp pain pierced his skull, making everything spin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no chance to cry out. His body simply slumped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before everything faded away, Jeff caught a glimpse of the driver&#39;s face twisted in a chilling grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda descended the stairs, feeling refreshed in her dress and practically bouncing with energy. &#34;Baby, I&#39;m all set. We should leave now if we want to get there on time,&#34; she called out, her voice brimming with anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was halfway through the living room when her eyes landed on Jeff, sprawled across the carpet,completely still. A stranger stood a few steps away, watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear surged through her, and she bolted for the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did not get far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger sprang forward,yanked her back by the hair, and smashed her head against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fiery pain exploded in her skull as blood streamed down the side of her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dizziness swept over her, making everything tilt and blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a hint of emotion, the man let go, and Hilda crumpled to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He calmly fished a small bottle from his pocket and drenched the lavish rug and sofa with liquid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp reek of gasoline quickly filled the air. He flicked open a lighter, tossing it onto the soaked floor without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fire tore through the room, swallowing every piece of furniture in its path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a calm that bordered on chilling, the man pulled out his phone and dialed. &#34;It&#39;s done, Lainey. There&#39;s nothing left to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chaos faded from Hilda&#39;s view as the world slipped further from her grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat pressed in from all sides, and through the flickering blaze, she caught a glimpse of the bracelet glinting at the edge of the rug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was supposed to be Eleanor&#39;s-something passed down from her own mother, a thread of memory tying their family together. Losing it now was unthinkable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every ounce of strength left in her body, Hilda dragged herself across the burning floor, reaching for the bracelet inch by agonizing inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers finally brushed against the metal. She gripped it fiercely, holding it to her chest to shield it from the flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smoke thickened around her as the fire raged, swallowing everything in its path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff still lay motionless nearby, offering no sign of waking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crushing hopelessness settled over her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many things left unsaid to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never truly told her how much she cared. She had never even heard Eleanor call her&#34;Mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dying here couldn&#39;t be the end-she refused to let it be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trembling, Hilda searched her pocket for her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her trembling hands stained the phone&#39;s screen with blood, bu she still managed to tap out the number she could never forget-Eleanor&#39;s. The ringing stopped, and the call went through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s voice drifted faintly from the speaker, but before Hilda could respond, exhaustion pulled her under completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone tumbled from her hand, clattering to the floor as shadows closed in and swallowed her whole.</p>
