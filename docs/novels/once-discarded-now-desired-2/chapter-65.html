                <p>The eighteenth came sooner than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had they stepped out of the sports car than Lillian dragged Eleanor straight into the banquet hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Jonny and Lainey tied the knot, huh? As if anything was official without Eleanor in attendance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in an elegant ink-hued couture gown and sporting bold red lips, Eleanor was destined to outshine Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall itself was a spectacle, gilded, over-the-top, the kind of decor that practically shouted for attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze swept the room without interest. She was unimpressed by the flashy décor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that this kind of grand extravagance was Vickie&#39;s idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she thought about Vickie&#39;s endless scheming, Eleanor&#39;s lips curled with a trace of amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When two scheming women clashed, who would come out on top?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a chorus of whispered gossip nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that Jonny&#39;s ex-wife? What&#39;s she doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Showing up on her ex-husband&#39;s wedding day, she&#39;s bold, that&#39;s for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s probably here to make a scene.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian tensed, ready to snap back, but Eleanor gave her a gentle tug, stopping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had made it this far; no amount of whispering would make Eleanor turn back now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, it was nothing more than a group of small-minded gossips hoping to stir up drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While greeting guests, Jonny immediately spotted Eleanor&#39;s arrival. Why was she here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hle was sure he hadn&#39;t sent her an invitation. Who had taken it upon themselves to let her in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she still had feelings for him and tagged along with Lillian, invitation or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Jonny convinced himself he had figured it out, the more self-satisfied he became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a show of strolling over, hand in hand with Lainey, putting on an air of the devoted fiancé.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Jonny could move closer, Lillian called out in an exaggerated tone, &#34;Miss Gilbert, is that the Enigma gown you had made just foryou? Absolutely...remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor kept silent, a subtle smile curving her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a day like this, crossing paths with Lillian could only spell trouble for Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the socialites, taking Lillian&#39;s words at face value, quickly chimed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh yes, it&#39;s gorgeous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Gilbert, your dress really is stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard Enigma&#39;s work is nearly impossible to get. Mr. Todd must truly treasure you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey glowed with pride, certain that her ten million investment had paid off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny,too, savored the compliments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was grateful Lainey had the sense to commission an Enigma gown-otherwise, how would he ever have impressed these ladies of high society?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the happy couple soaked up the compliments, Lillian slipped closer, flashing a sly grin. &#34;I&#39;m curious, is there any special meaning behind the dress?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A special meaning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lainey picked out the gown, she was simply drawn to its beauty. She had never given much thought to what it might symbolize. Still, with the spotlight on her, she needed an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment&#39;s consideration, Lainey replied, &#34;The dress features intricate web-like lace and winding serpent embroidery. It&#39;s meant to embody elegance, mystery, and an irresistible charm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests seemed to ponder her words, but Jonny looked the most affected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory flashed in his mind, a scene from their courtship, when Lainey would look at him with pure devotion in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of emotion swept through him, and his eyes softened as he looked at Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, beside them, Lillian was doing her best not to burst out laughing at Lainey&#39;s explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been trying to find a way to bring up the meaning behind the lace and serpent details, but Lainey had walked right into it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian couldn&#39;t tell whether Lainey genuinely had no clue about the symbolism, or if she was just pretending.Leaning into Eleanor, Lilian chuckled for a moment, about to make a witty remark when a familiar voice interrupted. &#34;What&#39;s so funny, Lillian?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland and Nolan strolled in, their confident, commanding presence immediately drawing every eye in the room.</p>
