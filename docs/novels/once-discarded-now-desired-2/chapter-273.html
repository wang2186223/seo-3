                <p>At the same moment, Nolan steered toward the Stewart family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Perry family&#39;s abrupt interference had triggered chaos that Grandpa had unwittingly unleashed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Grandpa became aware of his oversight, remorse would overwhelm him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His health was fragile already, and he might crumble under the burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Nolan&#39;s fears were confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing through the house&#39;s massive oak doors,Nolan froze at the sight of physicians and nurses hustling across the living room, their expressions shadowed with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Grandpa in trouble?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver of dread raced through Nolan, his chest constricting with each cautious step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector, the loyal family butler, hurried toward him,relief etched across his features. &#34;Mr. Stewart,you&#39;ve finally returned. The Perry family has acted against the Stewart Group. When your grandfather learned the news, he collapsed immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety laced his voice as he continued, &#34;What should we do? The delivery deadline is tomorrow,and missing it would trigger tenfold penalties. I fear this might destabilize everything the Stewarts have built over a century.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tightened his fists, determination blazing in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What audacity from the Perry family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a shrewd maneuver by Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tyler Perry had crossed into forbidden territory.Was he truly willing to challenge our family&#39;s authority?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boundary separating politics from business had always been untouchable. If Tyler defied those limits, he would respond without mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that resolve, he retrieved his phone and typed a message to an associate in Zerovia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alert your boss. Prepare a plan. Identify the ideal moment to bring Tyler Perry down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he slipped the device into his pocket than a doctor emerged hastily. &#34;Your grandfather is awake,though still weak. You should enter now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In only a few days, Norwood appeared a decade older, his face pale as he leaned against the headboard. Sighting Nolan, he forced a faint,weary smile. &#34;Never anticipated this... I spent decades striving, believing the Perry family&#39;s influence would elevate us. Instead, they outwitted me, and I&#39;ve jeopardized half our empire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan advanced slightly, his voice firm yet soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa, I&#39;m here. I will ensure the company Norwood examined him long and silently before exhaling a burdened sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always been cunning, rarely faltering,except in his dealings with Trudy and the Perry family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blind ambition and hunger for power had led him astray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had almost destroyed the Stewarts, and now, his only hope depended on the grandson he had nurtured. &#34;You&#39;re my pride, Nolan. I trust you completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Hector, standing quietly nearby, and issued a solemn command. &#34;Contact the board immediately. Remove Wray from the presidency and restore Nolan as leader. Also, transfer fifty percent of my shares to Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector&#39;s eyebrows lifted slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That quantity of stock granted total authority to Nolan. Yet he nodded without hesitation. &#34;Understood, sir.&#34;Once Hector departed, silence reclaimed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s weary eyes found Nolan&#39;s. &#34;This is all |can offer now. I&#39;m relying on you to protect our legacy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gripped his grandfather&#39;s hand firmly,unwavering. &#34;Grandpa, don&#39;t fear. I will manage everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nolan exited the estate, the afternoon sun illuminated the grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of driving to the office, he called Lilah. &#34;Stay with Eleanor without pause.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Perry family striking, Nolan couldn&#39;t allow Eleanor to remain alone in her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah sensed the seriousness instantly. &#34;Yes, sir. I won&#39;t leave her side.&#34;</p>
