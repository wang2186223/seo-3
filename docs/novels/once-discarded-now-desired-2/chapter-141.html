                <p>The Reed family wasted no time giving ther response the very next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood didn&#39;t hesitate before dialing Nolan&#39;s number. &#34;There&#39;s a project that needs your attention. Meet me at the Highland Brew House in thirty minutes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan barely paused before agreeing, then hung up and told Erick to get the car ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right on schedule, he walked into the Highland Brew House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes swept the place, searching for Norwood, but instead, Arya Reed, clad in a sparkling champagne dress, started waving at him with enthusiasm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit Nolan instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood had set him up, using the excuse of work to lure him into a blind date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on, he immediately turned on his heel to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arya, eager and determined not to let the opportunity slip away, hurried after him. She threw her arms wvide,trying to catch him from behind. &#34;Nolan, we finally get to see each other again. Please stay. I&#39;m not here to force you into anything. I&#39;ve had feelings for you since we were little. I&#39;d settle for being your lover if that&#39;s what it takes. I even got a hotel room. No one needs to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she got Nolan into bed, she knew exactly how to lock him in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would come back for more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning him over wouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her hopes crumbled in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she closed the gap, Nolan stepped aside effortlessly, avoiding her entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fixed her with a look of utter contempt and spoke in a chilling tone. &#34;If you don&#39;t stop pestering me, I&#39;ll make sure your family pays for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite bracing herself, Arya felt a chill of fear run through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was watch Nolan disappear out the door, powerless to stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giving up never crossed her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Norwood&#39;s support behind her, Arya was convinced that she belonged by Nolan&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If seduction had failed today, then another approach would be needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hiding her disappointment, Arya left the café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after Arya walked out, Lainey, who had been sitting quietly nearby, glanced down at her phone and studied the photo she had just snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the image, it looked as if Arya was wrapping her arms around Nolan from behind. Arya was all smiles,while Nolan&#39;s face gave nothing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be enough to make Eleanor loses her temper if she saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, just as Lainey was about to send it, a different plan occurred to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing this picture with Eleanor would only spark a fight, but sending it to Nolan might open up a chance for blackmail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he was so protective of Eleanor, he would do anything to keep her from seeing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All Lainey needed was a reason for him to meet her, and that would be enough for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever happened after,she could handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Nolan wanted to retaliate, she wasn&#39;t the least bit worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s excitement grew with each passing second as her plan took shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, she attached the photo to a message. &#34;Meet me at the café across from Stewart Group in an hour. If you don&#39;t show up, this picture goes straight to Eleanor.&#34; Meanwhile, Nolan had just settled into the backseat when his phone lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze narrowed at the image, a shot taken at just the right angle to cause trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was Lainey stirring things up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never seemed to quit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no fear that Eleanor would be fooled. Their trust ran deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What bothered him was Lainey&#39;s never-ending interference and her determination to drag Eleanor into the drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced up, expression icy cold. &#34;Take me back to Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
