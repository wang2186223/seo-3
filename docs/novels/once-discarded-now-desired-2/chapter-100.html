                <p>Eleanor had been tidying up inside Hope House when Nolan showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He,however,chose to wait outside rather than go in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention soon shifted to Erick, eyes sharp and unreadable. &#34;If the media storm about Eleanor&#39;s taxes can&#39;t be stopped, then make sure you handle whatever rumors are circling Hope House.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan understood just how much Myah meant to Eleanor, and he figured Eleanor must be on edge by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Erick, nearly bouncing with enthusiasm,gave his report. &#34;There&#39;s no need for that, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He passed over the tablet, barely containing his excitement. &#34;Everything&#39;s been flipped on its head!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Nolan, looking puzzled, took the tablet from him,his brow furrowed in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he saw next surprised him: right at the top of the trending list, the official Twitter account of the Elepdon Museum caught his eye. The museum&#39;s recent post, tagging Eleanor,announced, &#34;Miss Eleanor Warren, we appreciate your commitment to preserving national treasures. During the auction, you generously gifted the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara to our museum. This artifact carries tremendous historical value and significance. Our museum will be hosting a special exhibition in two weeks, and we are inviting everyone to join us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan couldn&#39;t believe it. She really gave away the tiara?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered how happy she had been that day,never once imagining she had bought it just to give it away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she really hiding? His curiosity only grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nolan kept scrolling, the replies caught his attention even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A highlighted, pinned reply from the Elepdon Museum stood out at the very top of the comment section.&#34;Miss Warren has been supporting the preservation of artifacts for years, so her tax status has been clear for a long time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One reply stood out. &#34;Wait, are you saying she&#39;s actually been donating for years?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another chimed in, &#34;Did things just do a complete  turnaround?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else explained, &#34;The important thing is,she donated the piece the very same day she bought it.That means she always intended it for the museum.Why is anyone blaming her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly had no idea. I take back what I said.My apologies,&#34; another commenter admitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet another added, &#34;If her goal was always to donate it, why should she owe any taxes in the first place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different user chimed in, &#34;I work with Photoshop,and let me tell you those bank statement screenshots people were sharing were definitely edited.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma, we&#39;re sorry. We really messed up.&#34; Another remorseful comment read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The majority of the responses were supportive, but tucked away among them was one vague reply.&#34;Doesn&#39;t this strategy look familiar? If I&#39;m not mistaken, the last person to pull something like this was Butterfly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the world of collectors, Butterfly was practically legendary, famous for her commitment to safeguarding the nation&#39;s treasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone with insider knowledge would have pieced together Eleanor&#39;s true identity after seeing this. The majority of online commenters, though, weren&#39;t experts. They were just regular people, blissfully unaware.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan picked up on it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be? Was Eleanor actually Butterfly all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That possibility left him feeling undeserving of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor always seemed gentle and sweet to him, and she had never stopped to surprise him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, he was simply another rich guy, nothing truly remarkable in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought pushed Nolan into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he needed to make his move before anyone else uncovered the truth and tried to win her over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization sent him rushing out of the car and straight into Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant he found Eleanor, Nolan pulled her aside to a corner, wrapping her in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath brushed against her cheek as he spoke softly. &#34;You accepted my ring that day, remember? So,what do you say? Will you marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hadn&#39;t been expecting a proposal, so his  question left her speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s tone shifted, sounding almost wounded as he admitted, &#34;Even just being you, you&#39;ve already got a crowd of admirers. If everyone knew about your another identity, how am I supposed to compete?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really just trying to stake his claim before anyone else could?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization made Eleanor chuckle. &#34;Why would you even think that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, Nolan rested his chin on her shoulder, his voice tinged with annoyance. &#34;I saw what people were saying online. They&#39;re already guessing you&#39;re Butterfly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,her secret was starting to unravel after all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought wiped the playful spark from Eleanor&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eased out of his arms and pulled out her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers moved quickly as she scrolled through the hot topics and comment threads, a quiet sigh of relief escaping her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank goodness, only a handful of people seemed to have caught on to the truth so far.</p>
