                <p>Deep in the shadows of an old, forgotten warehouse on the city&#39;s edge, agonized screams bounced off rusted walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick watched the battered truck driver with cool detachment, not a flicker of emotion crossing his face. Two hulking guards kept the man upright,though he looked ready to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, Erick closed the distance, casting a long shadow over the trembling driver. &#34;Let&#39;s make this easy for both of us. Give up the name of the person who hired you, or I promise you&#39;ll wish you hadn&#39;t kept quiet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dripped from the driver&#39;s mouth as he forced a crooked smile. &#34;I&#39;m not a snitch. The job&#39;s done, and I keep my word. Go ahead, do your worst.&#34; If law enforcement had him in their hands, he might have talked for a chance at parole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the way these people operated, they were taking justice into their own hands and dishing it out as they saw fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he told the truth, he might as well dig his own grave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the questioning hit a dead end, the thick iron door of the factory burst open with a loud kick from the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a violent bang, the heavy door slammed open,sending a shockwave of fear through everyone in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped inside, his silhouette framed by the harsh light behind him, radiating cold authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused to loosen his tie, every movement deliberate and menacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody expected him to show up in person. Erick&#39;s heart skipped a beat as he rushed forward. &#34;Mr.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stewart, I was just about to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Nolan acted as if he hadn&#39;t heard a word he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved past Erick without a word, his face set in a hard line, eyes locking onto the driver who, bruised and bloodied, still held his head high with defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of pure contempt flickered across Nolan&#39;s face before he issued his chilling command. &#34;Bring his family in. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, Erick nodded and hurried to obey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sudden panic drained the color from the driver&#39;s cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started thrashing against his captors, wild with fear,but there was no escaping their grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation took hold as he pleaded, voice cracking,&#34;Leave my family out of this! Please, they&#39;ve done nothing wrong! My wife&#39;s sick, and my son&#39;s just a little kid!&#34; Nolan closed the distance, leaning in until his presence was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something cold and unreadable in his eyes, and beneath it all burned a clear hunger for blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What has my girlfriend done to deserve this? She never laid a hand on anyone. Doesn&#39;t that make her innocent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, who used to light up every room,now lay trapped in pain, struggling just to breathe without wincing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet this man had the gall to hide behind his loved ones,hoping for mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s tone dropped lower, colder than before.&#34;Give me a name. You don&#39;t get another chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic twisted the driver&#39;s face. His eyes darted desperately, sweat and blood mixing on his brow as his resolve crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear clawed at him. Either his own life would end  here, or everything he loved would be destroyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, defeat hollowed out his features. His shoulders slumped. The fight was gone from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Emma Todd,&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every trace of warmth vanished from Nolan&#39;s face.&#34;That&#39;s all I needed,&#34; he said, voice like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for another word, he spun around and strode for the door, as if the man before him wasn&#39;t worth another second of his time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick stared after him, caught off guard, then scrambled to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed after his boss, trying to keep pace as he asked, &#34;Mr. Stewart, what should we do about the driver?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t slow down, his answer cutting through the gloom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t kill him. Make sure he&#39;s breathing, then drop him at the nearest police station.&#34; There would be no mercy tonight. His mind was already moving to the next target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm gathered in his gaze. &#34;As for the Todd Group,wipe them out. Emma&#39;s gotten away with too much for far too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single member of that Todd family could claim innocence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had once snapped up a hefty portion of Todd Group shares, thinking he might hand the whole business over to Eleanor someday. But he had changed his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd family wouldn&#39;t escape what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused and shot Erick a look so cold, it made the man&#39;s skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Track down Emma. I don&#39;t care if she&#39;s breathing when you find her. Check every person she&#39;s spoken to, every place she&#39;s been. I want to find out who put this plan in her head.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick swallowed hard, nerves prickling at the finality in his boss&#39;s tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There would be no second chances for Emma now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He answered with careful respect, not daring to slip in the slightest, &#34;Understood,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick stood there, his eyes following the black Bentley as it tore off into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night breeze swept past, but the cold that crept over him came from deep within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Nolan&#39;s fury was real, a force that wouldn&#39;t be held back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked as though Elepdon was about to face a storm.</p>
