                <p>Lainey hadn&#39;t made it three steps from the door before her phone rang, sharp and unexpected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heart racing, she slipped into the stairwell, her hands clammy and her face drained of color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller ID flashed across the screen, making her gri her teeth. She answered, irritation sharp in her voice, &#34;What now? Didn&#39;t I tell you not to call unless it was urgent?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, mocking laugh echoed from the other end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a handful, aren&#39;t you? I went out of my way to help you, and instead of figuring out how to show a little gratitude, this is how you choose to talk to me. Truly, I&#39;m heartbroken,&#34; Horace remarked, each word lazily taunting, pressing against Lainey&#39;s nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retorted, &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Help?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t asked him for anything. Not recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could piece it together, Horace&#39;s tone changed, smooth but laced with quiet threat.&#34;Your brother Fraser sent some people to Zerovia, digging around for dirt on you. Good thing for you, my team intercepted them before they got anywhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let the words linger, slow and deadly. &#34;They al died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s thoughts erupted in chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her back to the cold wall, trying not to sink to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser was on her trail-he had sent people halfway around the world to find out what she had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he already know? What evidence was in his hands?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. This couldn&#39;t be happening.  Sitting around and waiting to be found out was never an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she let Fraser keep digging, every last secret she had fought to hide would spill out into the open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fooling Jeff and his wife wouldn&#39;t save her-she needed something ironclad, a plan that couldn&#39;t fall apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Horace was the only person left she could count on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to sound calm, Lainey let her voice turn soft, sweet as honey. &#34;Horace, you know me better than that. I was just worried you might get caught up in this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft chuckle, as though she had never been the one who lost control. &#34;You can count on me to remember what you&#39;ve done for me. Would you mind lending me a hand again? Just help me take over the Benton family business. Once I&#39;ve done that, I&#39;ll split everything I get from the Bentons with you. What do you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other side of the call stayed quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey could picture the greedy spark lighting up his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half of the Benton family&#39;s fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody could walk away from a deal like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Horace&#39;s low laugh echoed after a pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a deal,&#34; Horace replied,sounding pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey allowed herself to breathe easier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she had to handle Fraser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting rid of him completely wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in his position would only cause more trouble if he died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just needed to keep him occupied and out of her way until her plan worked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she had the old couple completely on her side, she could take her time figuring out how to handle him With that settled in her mind, Lainey gave a clear order. &#34;I don&#39;t care what it takes. Just get Fraser to come back to Breoqua.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace did not like being bossed around, but thoughts of the Benton family&#39;s fortune were enough to make him agree. &#34;Alright. But if you try anything after this-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always circled back to threats like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey cut him off without missing a beat. &#34;Horace, both of us are stuck in this together. There&#39;s no backing out now. If I go back on my word, I&#39;ll have nowhere to hide. Just do your part and trust me. Before long, the Benton family will belong to us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew exactly how to keep him interested, and her voice made that clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time,Horace seemed truly convinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, Lainey let her hand fall to her side and her smile vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails pressed into her palms until she felt a sting of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sharp sensation helped her focus and push aside any fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would not let anyone block her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had not survived everything she had been through just to end up losing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything the Benton family owned would one day be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking the fire in her eyes, she turned and pressed the fire door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she had barely stepped out when she collided with a broad chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced up and met a pair of dark, unreadable eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser stood right in front of her.</p>
