                <p>Just as Eleanor and Nolan were about to step out of the car, his phone rang with Erick&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t catch the details of the conversation, but Nolan&#39;s expression darkened noticeably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few moments later, he hung up and faced her. &#34;Something&#39;s come up at the office. I need to head back.Stay here and wait for me,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was officially left alone to watch the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave a small, resigned nod and watched him drive off before stepping into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What greeted her inside was unexpected. Norwood was sitting on the living room sofa, looking like he had been waiting a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, he should have been at the Stewart family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he deliberately led Nolan away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor squared her shoulders and kept tone even. &#34;Good evening, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood snorted. &#34;Good evening? Huh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just a few days, this little troublemaker had managed to stir up a storm. If it weren&#39;t for Jeff&#39;s urgent call,he might still have been in the dark about all this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slammed his cane on the floor, making his presence even more formidable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, I don&#39;t care about where you come from or your past. But you&#39;re educated, so you should know the basics of decency. You&#39;re divorced. If you really care about Nolan and want what&#39;s best for him, you should step aside. His partner should lift him up, not drag him down.&#34; Was he trying to soften it a bit? Eleanor wasn&#39;t about to be swayed either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head slightly, sat comfortably across from him, and casually sipped her coffee. &#34;Mr. Stewart,I think you&#39;ve got it wrong,&#34; she said smoothly. &#34;My relationship with Nolan isn&#39;t at all what you think, and l&#39;ve never been a burden to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, meeting his sharp stare directly. &#34;Actually, it&#39;s you, under the guise of looking out for him,who keeps bringing in women you think are right for him, without thinking about the mess it creates. Aren&#39;t you the one causing problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words hit Norwood hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt a sudden tightness in his chest, as if he couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his whole life, his words had been law. No one had ever talked back like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Nolan&#39;s grandfather-wasn&#39;t it his right to guide him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!.&#34; he fumed, stumbling over his words in sheer rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Nolan, who had sensed something was wrong, returned and stepped into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Nolan seemed to give Norwood an outlet for his fury. His hand trembled as he pointed at Eleanor.&#34;Look at her! This is who you&#39;ve chosen! And she has the audacity to say I&#39;m the problem. She&#39;ll be the death of me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, just like that, his vision blurred and he collapsed backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa!&#34; Nolan shouted, rushing forward. He caught Norwood carefully and gently lowered him onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call his private doctor,&#34; he ordered at once, and a nearby maid hurried off to make the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, on the other hand, froze for a moment. She hadn&#39;t expected Norwood to actually pass out from anger.&#34;Uh,1-&#34;she started, but Nolan shook his head, signaling her to stay silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She immediately swallowed back her words, and the room fell into a tense silence.</p>
