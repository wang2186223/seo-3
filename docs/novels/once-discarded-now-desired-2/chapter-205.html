                <p>Outside Nightfall, the place glowed unnaturally bright, though it should have long been closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The manager, flanked by a few security/ guards,was wiping sweat from his forehead. When the black Bentley tore up to the entrance, his jaw dropped as if a phantom had appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and Nolan stepped out, every inch the picture of authority and menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any attempt at a charming smile vanished instantly;the manager dropped into a deep bow, trying to make himself small. &#34;Mr. Stewart, what brings you here in person? You could&#39;ve just called... there&#39;s no need for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Surveillance,&#34; Nolan interrupted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The single word froze the manager in place. He nodded so quickly it was almost desperate. &#34;Yes,sir! Right this way to the control room!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hurried inside, moving swiftly through the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the control room, a technician fumbled nervously at the controls, and soon, footage appeared on the screens.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At 7:27 p.m., a black Maybach pulled up to the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped out and walked alone toward the bar door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked the bartender for directions, then made her way to a private room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low electrical hum crackled through the speakers,and every screen went pitch black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s stomach dropped. &#34;What the hell happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The technician wiped his forehead, his voice trembling as he explained, &#34;Around 7:30, the bar lost power completely. The main circuit tripped. It was an accident. Emergency crews were called immediately,but it took half an hour to get full power back. So,fromn 7:30 to 8:00, the cameras captured nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes burned into the blank screen, and the tension in the room sank to an almost suffocating level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fists clenched so tight that his knuckles went white. Damn, that was one hell of a setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, chilling laugh escaped him, sending a shiver through the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that someone had been targeting Eleanor all along, carefully setting this up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All through the night, Nolan searched Elepdon relentlessly, leaving no place unchecked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Eleanor had disappeared completely, as if she had simply vanished into the air. There was no sign of her anywhere. Back at the Brooks family&#39;s villa, the tension was just as heavy. Erick stood in the middle of the living room,looking exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news he delivered hit Lillian hard, even though she had just sobered up. It felt like the floor had vanished beneath her feet, and she wobbled,barely able to stay upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the one to blame,&#34; she murmured. &#34;If I hadn&#39;t gotten drunk, if I hadn&#39;t asked her to come get me,none of this would have happened. If something happens to her... I&#39;ll never forgive myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland had just come rushing in from the company.Seeing Lillian in such despair made his chest tighten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he moved forward and steadied her trembling body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted to say something to comfort her, bout words.failed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he turned to Erick and asked in a low voice,&#34;Where&#39;s Nolan?&#34; Erick&#39;s face darkened even further. &#34;He... he is on his way to his grandfather&#39;s.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was visiting grandfather&#39;s place? Now? At a moment like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take him long to piece it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Eleanor to vanish so completely while under Nolan&#39;s watch, leaving absolutely no trace, there was probably only one person in Elepdon who could pull that off-Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan headed for his grandfather&#39;s place. This wasn&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Norwood was involved or not, Nolan couldn&#39;t confront him directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland let go of Lillian gently, grabbed his coat from the sofa, and bolted for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep an eye on her. I&#39;ll be back soon,&#34; he called to Erick without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick hesitated for a fraction of a second, his worry for Nolan clashing with his concern for Lillian. But seeing her so shattered, he nodded firmly. &#34;I will.&#34;</p>
