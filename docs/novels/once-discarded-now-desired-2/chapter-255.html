                <p>The incident at the Lumina Hotel lobby was caught on someone&#39;s phone and quickly posted online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next day, a new trending topic exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shocking! Former Stewart Group CEO Confronts Current CEO Over a Divorced Woman!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bold headline drew countless eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The video spread like wildfire, and the comments section turned into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That executive&#39;s mouth is filthy! What age are we in,still throwing around such insults?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wray is no better. His man mocked his family&#39;s bride -to-be, and he stood there grinning-shows his character.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say what you want, but Nolan standing up for his girl was actually quite cool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the Internet buzzed, Eleanor and Nolan paid it no mind.  Hilda,however, was furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff had just returned from trimming the garden when he noticed her dark expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart tightened. He dropped his tools at once and hurried over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, baby? Are you feeling unwell?&#34; he asked with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without speaking, Hilda shoved a tablet into his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeff watched the video, his face turned just as grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes were red with anger, her chest heaving.&#34;How could they talk about Eleanor like that? We can&#39;t let this pass!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff wrapped her in his arms, patting her back gently.His voice was low and steady. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe Wray had the audacity to bully Eleanor-and he swore Wray would pay the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s downfall could be brushed off as family strife within the Stewarts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Wray to publicly humiliate Eleanor? Unforgivable. This was more than an insult to Nolan-it was a slap to the Benton family&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jeff would never sit idle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After soothing Hilda, he went straight to his study and dialed Denny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reach out quietly to our business associates in Breoqua. From today on, cut ties with the new Stewart Group CEO, Wray. Anyone siding with him will be treated as an enemy of the Benton family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff paused momentarily before continuing, &#34;And spread the word-the Benton family recognizes only Nolan as the head of the Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Wray arrived at the company, still riding high on dreams of power. But the same executive who had flattered him in the hotel lobby came rushing in, pale and frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, we have a problem!&#34; he stammered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray, savoring his own triumph, frowned at the interruption. &#34;Why the panic? Have some composure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was nearly in tears. &#34;Several top firms in Breoqua-led by the Benton Group-just emailed to terminate all contracts! They also announced they&#39;ll only work with Nolan! And...And-&#34; His voice shook as he added, &#34;&#39;Inside the company, the entire executive office has gone on strike!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s smugness vanished in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had to be Nolan stirring trouble with the Benton family&#39;s help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That damned Nolan!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he really think these dirty tricks could bring him down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a fallen heir like Nolan cause him any real harm?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling himself, Wray snapped, &#34;What are you crying about? Get Marketing and HR on this! Replace anyone on strike-talent is everywhere if you have the money.Let&#39;s see what tricks Nolan can still play!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a frown, he went on, &#34;As for those Breoqua companies, if they insist on canceling, tell them to pay every cent of their penalty into my account!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that a solution?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive didn&#39;t dare argue, though he silently disapproved, and went off to carry out the order. The thing was, Nolan had no idea any of this was happening-until Erick brought the news the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tapping his fingers lightly on the desk,Nolan chuckled.&#34;Well, this is interesting. I wonder how Wray is handling it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick hesitated before asking, &#34;Mr. Stewart, do you think this was Mr. Benton&#39;s doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan leaned back in his chair,thoughtful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, he gave a small nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who else but Jeff could wield such influence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the clearest, most forceful way to stand up for Eleanor-and a warning to the entire business wvorld.No one, under any circumstance, was allowed to bully a Benton.</p>
