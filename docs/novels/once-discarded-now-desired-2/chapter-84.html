                <p>Lainey&#39;s post instantly set Enigma&#39;s fans on the attack,their urge to defend her erupting in full force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The replies under Eleanor&#39;s tweet grew nastier by the minute, overflowing with cruel and biting remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, barely able to contain her outrage, called Eleanor in a rush. &#34;Eleanor, how long are you going to let her get away with this? When are you finally going to shut her down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was fed up with Lainey&#39;s manipulations and couldn&#39;t tolerate another second</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor wouldn&#39;t step up, Lillian was determined to find someone who would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was. Eleanor had been thinking about making a move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would let her call out Lainey&#39;s behavior without revealing the fact that she was Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she had another idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly, enigmatic smile appeared on her lips. &#34;Right  now&#39;s the perfect moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian could reply, Eleanor had already ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jumped onto Twitter and switched to an account that hadn&#39;t posted in three years but still boasted tens of millions of followers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much effort, Eleanor snapped a selfie, her expression calm but laced with quiet defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tap, she shared the photo and let the tweet fly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland was the first to spot the new post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw practically hit the floor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No way! Eleanor is actually Enigma?&#34; he blurted out in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he questioned whether he was even awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things only escalated when Besty, Enigma Group&#39;s brand director, immediately shared Enigma&#39;s tweet,adding,&#34;Welcome back, Enigma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That repost made it official that Eleanor really was Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet exploded. &#34;Are you kidding me? Was I actually trash-talking my favorite designer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe how clueless I was.I want to crawl into a hole and disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could I have insulted the real Enigma while defending a fake? I honestly deserve a slap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma, I&#39;m so sorry. We&#39;re not worthy of being your fans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans flooded Eleanor&#39;s comments with tearful apologies, desperate to make amends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor never cared what they thought, anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, if Lillian hadn&#39;t been attacked by online mobs,Eleanor would have never revealed herself</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick tap, she sent out another tweet. &#34;Lillian is the one you owe an apology to. If not for her, Enigma would have stayed away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those two short tweets unleashed a fresh tidal wave online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, the fans were caught off guard, but they soon understood exactly what Eleanor was getting at Eleanor was right, and if Lillian hadn&#39;t been targeted by trolls, Enigma would have stayed hidden, just as she had for the past three years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was their own actions that dragged Lillian into the mess and forced Enigma to reveal herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans found themselves deeply touched by the loyalty between Enigma and Lillian</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, Enigma felt untouchable, as distant and flawless as the moon hanging in the night sky</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were almost afraid to bother her, worried their words would ruin the magic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, all their guilt and protective energy were redirected to Lillian, swearing to defend Enigma&#39;s best friend at all costs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To make up for it, I just placed ten orders from the Brooks Group website!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, similar comments flooded in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s all shop together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m officially switching my whole house to Brooks Group products!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, the Brooks Group&#39;s online store was completely wiped out by fans. Not a single item, down to the last toilet seat cover,was left in stock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, the Brooks Group&#39;s stock pice skyrocketed.</p>
