                <p>The crowd&#39;s hushed voices and judgmental glances didn&#39;t faze Eleanor. She remained completely unbothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved her eyes from face to face, hoping Nolan would appear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps Norwood had taken him away, maybe even locked him up somewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood always liked having the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan couldn&#39;t break through for her, she would let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never wanted love to feel like a cage. Meanwhile, Lillian looked like she was about to explode. She was seconds away from starting a fight.&#34;Norwood&#39;s totally out of line! He...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could take a step, someone grabbed her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland appeared at her side, his expression more serious than usual. &#34;Lillian, don&#39;t be reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the Stewart and the Brooks families were close, this mess still belonged to the Stewarts.It wasn&#39;t their place to get involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room snapped when a loud crash echoed from the floor above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every head turned to see what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The study door upstairs had been slammed open from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the threshold, Nolan lingered, his once crisp black suit now looking rumpled and worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a fierceness in his eyes that no one had seen before, and the air around him seemed to darken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, he marched down the stairs. He made a beeline for Eleanor, wrapped his arms around her, and stood between her and everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he looked up, his eyes cold as he locked eyes with Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m making this official as head of the Stewart family, the engagement with the Benton family is null and void. From now on, Eleanor is the only woman I&#39;ll call my wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After saying that, he paid no mind to anyone else. He reached for Eleanor&#39;s hand and walked out without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched, stunned. No one had time to process what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s anger boiled over. &#34;Nolan! Come back here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook so hard that his cane wobbled as he pointed it at Nolan&#39;s back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t slow down or look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them disappeared in moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, Norwood&#39;s rage caught up with him, and he collapsed to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody call for help!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos erupted throughout the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s face soured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lainey hadn&#39;t been so determined to marry Nolan,he would never have put up with all the shame the Stewart family made him swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he didn&#39;t get a clear answer today, he was ready to end things for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey read Jeff&#39;s mood and rushed to reassure him.&#34;Dad, please don&#39;t get upset. Nolan just learned the truth, so of course, he&#39;s going to push back. But the</p>
                
                
                
                <p>engagement&#39;s already public, and there&#39;s no undoing it now. Just let him cool off. He&#39;ll comne to terms with it soon enough and let Eleanor go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was terrified that Jeff might break off the engagement in a fit of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t allow that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything she had done, she refused to give up now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s anger meant nothing as long as Norwood stood by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She believed she would become Nolan&#39;s wife, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration burned inside Jeff. This was public humiliation for the Benton family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he saw Lainey&#39;s cheer, he decided to hold his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one noticed Hilda staring at the girl whose hand Nolan clutched so firmly. She didn&#39;t need proof anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos hadn&#39;t prepared her for the sharp, gut-wrenching pain that hit now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her child had been humiliated today, and she hadn&#39;t been able to defend her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her husband fawn over the imposter made it even harder to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t waste any more time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to uncover the truth; she needed her daughter back.</p>
