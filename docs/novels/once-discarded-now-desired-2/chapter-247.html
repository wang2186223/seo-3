                <p>Inside the vehicle, silence pressed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick kept his hands steady on the wheel, glancing at Nolan&#39;s quiet figure through the mirror above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the passing years, Nolan never once spoke of Colson, yet Erick recognized that name as the deepest scar lodged inside Nolan&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s presence alone was like steel driven into that scar, an unyielding reminder of memories Nolan wished buried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Brodie suddenly back in the country, Erick sensed danger looming close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated briefly, then broke the silence, saying,&#34;Boss, I&#39;ve already arranged someone to shadow Brodie.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a faint &#34;Hmm,&#34; then added calmly,&#34;Be sure Grandpa doesn&#39;t hear about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa had grown old, and after recent ordeals, his health carried too much fragility. Learning this truth would only weigh heavily upon him. Beside Nolan, Eleanor felt the coolness of his palm and instinctively clasped it tighter, her gaze colored with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught that flicker of worry, and the chill he carried dissolved.Leaning playfully near her ear, he asked,&#34;Eleanor, what did you just call me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, she froze, remembering calling him &#34;baby&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her face, and she pushedhim lightly,muttering, &#34;Sit straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to yield, Nolan teased further. &#34;Say it again.Only once more,hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car eased to a halt before the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor spotted her chance and swiftly pushed the door open, fleeing without a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amused, Nolan let out a soft laugh and chased after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, their playful tussle ended with Eleanor&#39;s surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lowered his chin onto her head, brushing her hair gently, voice dropping tenderly. &#34;Eleanor, the last engagement banquet wasn&#39;t completed. Let&#39;s hold  another-this time flawless, no interruptions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart longed to give her a celebration both grand and whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his arms, Eleanor blinked, startled by the sudden proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet beneath the surprise, warmth quietly rose within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a small nod,whispering,&#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time Nolan&#39;s plans for the engagement eclipsed anything before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fireworks and drones rehearsed in dazzling scale,unmatched in splendor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beyond that, he proclaimed across the city that every congratulation for their union carried the chance to win part of a hundred-million-dollar prize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement swept through the streets, while envy spread-everyone knew Nolan, once the city&#39;s most sought-after bachelor, now belonged fully to Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the couch, Lillian bounced restlessly with her phone clutched in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ahhh! Eleanor! Look! The entire city is reposting your engagement notice with Nolan!&#34;She shoved the glowing screen before Eleanor,showing the dramatic announcement Nolan had broadcast. &#34;Congratulations on the engagement-get your chance to win a share of a hundred-million-dollar prize.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bold headline flashed loudly and was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overcome by extravagance and sweetness, Lillian declared, &#34;I swear, Nolan is the most thoughtful man alive! Such a huge moment-we must celebrate properly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her friend&#39;s endless excitement, Eleanor exhaled helplessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lavish gestures stirred little inside her; if Nolan was the one beside her, that alone was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she also knew Nolan wished to make amends by giving her a flawless engagement party. It carried the depth of his true intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without pausing, Lillian pulled Eleanor upright from the cushions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on! I know somewhere amazing! There&#39;s an event at the racetrack today-we&#39;ll go together. Think of it as a farewell tosinglehood!&#34; Though Eleanor feared driving, Lillian&#39;s bubbling enthusiasm swept her along, leaving no chance to refuse.</p>
