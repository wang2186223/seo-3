                <p>Inside the hospital room, Hilda slowly opened her eyes, though her vision was still hazy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept across the room, searching for someone. When she realized Eleanor wasn&#39;t there, her chest tightened. That brief spark of hope she had held onto dimmed almost instantly,leaving behind only disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor soon walked in, brisk and professional, giving her a careful checkup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her vitals are stable, and she&#39;s fully conscious,&#34; he explained as he removed his stethoscope, addressing the Benton family gathered nearby. &#34;For now, she&#39;s out of immediate danger. But her condition is fragile.She must avoid stress or any strong emotional shocks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff let out a long breath of relief at those words. His shoulders finally loosened, and he clasped Hilda&#39;s hand tightly, his voice thick with emotion. &#34;Honey, you don&#39;t know how terrified I was. I thought I&#39;d lost you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Lainey&#39;s fingers curled so tightly against her palm that her knuckles turned white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected Hilda to wake up this soon. She hadn&#39;t even had the chance to take further steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,this was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hilda had the chance to talk about Eleanor or, worse, see her again, everything Lainey had fought for would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With so many people around, she couldn&#39;t risk doing anything reckless just yet. Still, she had to move fast,because if Hilda managed to tell Jeff and Fraser about Eleanor, it would all be over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to stay composed, Lainey quickly put on a mask of sorrow and concern. She let her eyes brim with tears as she stepped closer to the bed. &#34;Mom, you don&#39;t know how worried we were. We&#39;ve been so scared for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat down gently at the bedside, brushing her hand over Hilda&#39;s in a tender gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hilda subtly pulled her hand away and, feigning fatigue, shut her eyes. She didn&#39;t want to waste a single word on Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for Lainey&#39;s interference, she would have already reunited with Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with her energy so weak, the only way to guard her heart was through silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, oblivious to the quiet rejection, assumed Hilda was simply drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He busied himself adjusting her pillow, holding a glass of water near her lips, and fussing over every little detail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser, however, was standing a little apart, looking worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on his mother for a moment before he followed the attending doctor out into the quieter hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor,&#34; he asked in a low voice, &#34;what exactly triggered my mother&#39;s attack this time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor paused, gathering his thoughts. &#34;Mr. Benton, the test results point to an acute asthma episode.Most likely, it was set off by a strong allergen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;A strong allergen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew his mother had a history of asthma, but that was long ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t had a single attack in years. So why had it suddenly flared up again, and so violently,the very moment she returned home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His instincts told him something at the restaurant wasn&#39;t right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was it really possible that the girl who looked so much like his mother when she was young was behind it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, that didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had anything to hide, she never would have been the first to suggest pulling the surveillance tapes or calling in the police. Lainey, on the other hand, had looked visibly shaken at her suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser exhaled slowly and stepped over to the window. Pulling out his phone, he dialed his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pull every bit of surveillance from Verdant Crest yesterday at noon. Cross-check every staff member who was working,&#34; he instructed, his tone dropping like ice. &#34;I need a full account of everyone my mother saw and everything that happened from the moment she walked into that restaurant until the incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m on it, Mr. Benton,&#34; came the reply, but Fraser didn&#39;t end the call right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers drummed lightly against the cold window ledge as his mind circled back to those eyes, the ones that mirrored his mother&#39;s so vividly. The image burned sharper and sharper in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it really just coincidence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still lost in thought, he added another order.&#34;Also, set a meeting with Eleanor Warren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did he end the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he turned back toward the hospital room, his expression hardened with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever this was, he wouldn&#39;t rest until he uncovered the truth himself.</p>
