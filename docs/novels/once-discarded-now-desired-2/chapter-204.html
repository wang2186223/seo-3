                <p>Even though Nolan had told Eleanor not to wait up,he ended up finishing his work faster than expected and returned to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he walked inside, she wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner table was still set. No one had touched the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan loosened his tie, his movements slowing as a faint crease appeared between his brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lilah appeared from the kitchen and greeted him respectfully. &#34;Welcome home, Mr.Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s Eleanor?&#34; Nolan asked, dropping his tie on the sofa before taking his seat at the head of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She mentioned she was going to pick up Ms. Brooks and would be back later for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, that girl always managed to wedge herself between him and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was time her family found her a husband so she wouldn&#39;t be hanging around anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat and waited, but the ticking clock only made his calm unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten o&#39;clock passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then eleven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food on the table was stone cold by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer the silence stretched, the heavier the unease pressed against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally picked up his phone and dialed her, but all he got was a mechanical voice saying, &#34;The number you have dialed is not available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened as he tried again, only to hear the same response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chilling sense of dread gripped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, a servant&#39;s voice came from the doorway. &#34;Mr. Stewart, Ms. Brooks has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Lillian stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks were flushed, and her words slurred.&#34;Eleanor, you traitor! Putting love before friendship!You said you&#39;d pick me up! Where are you hiding?Come out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused mid-complaint and looked up, meeting Nolan&#39;s cold, sharp eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air went still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One look from him sobered her up in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then the very next moment, both of them asked at the same time, &#34;Where is she?&#34; &#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian froze, blinking as if her brain had short-circuited. A few seconds later, an icy chill started crawling through her chest. &#34;Wait, what? Eleanor should&#39;ve been here already. The bar called her with my phone,and she promised to get me. I even waited around until I was sober, but she never came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes turned sharply dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah said Eleanor had gone out, but Lillian said she never saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sick certainty clenched in his gut. Something had happened to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot to his feet, the chair scraping harshly against the floor, and strode out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden intensity rolling off Nolan rattled Lillian.Without even thinking, she rushed after him. &#34;Nolan,what&#39;s happening? Is Eleanor-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan yanked open the car door, phone already pressed to his ear as he dialed Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call the authorities. Trace the Maybach Eleanor drove tonight. I want the last location in five minutes.&#34; His voice left no room for argument, and he ended the call without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian hurried to the car, gripping the doorframe.&#34;Did she vanish on the way? Or-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s in trouble.&#34; His tone was calm, yet the certainty in it hit Lillian like a blow, leaving her shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could ask anything else, his phone buzzed again, and Erick&#39;s voice came through,urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, we traced the car. It was abandoned on a side street close to Nightfall and hasn&#39;t been touched since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t waste a second. He slammed his foot on the gas, and the black Bentley shot forward into the dark.</p>
