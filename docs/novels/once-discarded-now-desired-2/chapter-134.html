                <p>Chapter . She was now the sole daughter of the Benton family, and no one would dare cross her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next mission?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To win Nolan away from Eleanor.Once that was done, her life would be nothing short of success and luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but laugh out loud at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of her own laughter was interrupted when her phone buzzed with an anonymous message. &#34;Now that the recognition banquet is done, where are my shares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Lainey&#39;s face vanished instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, the threat of Horace exposing her secrets had terrified her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, with Jeff standing firmly behind her, how could a simple video ever shake his confidence in her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The demand was still open for negotiation, considering that five percent was clearly excessive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She composed her reply, but the response came almost immediately. &#34;No way. Pay up the 5% like we agreed, or you know what&#39;s coming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a fierce determination in her eyes, Lainey fixed her gaze on the screen. If Horace was so stubborn, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contracts could be manipulated, just like her own identity, with blurred lines between what was real and what was fabricated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could truly tell the difference?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her decision settled, Lainey stood and headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the living room, Jeff and Hilda were sitting on the couch, watching TV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw her, Jeff looked up with concern. &#34;Baby, it&#39;s so late.Where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a warm, charming smile, Lainey replied in a gentle tone, &#34;A friend invited me to celebrate, and I couldn&#39;t say no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Jeff instructed the driver to get the car ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After stopping by the law firm, Lainey placed a contract, which held no legal weight, at the designated spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that was done, Lainey returned to the Benton family&#39;s home, feeling a sense of relief wash over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was to wait for the right moment to deal with Horace. Once that was handled, nothing would stand in her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Eleanor, she would never know that the Bentons were her real parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Lainey didn&#39;t know was that Hilda doubted that she was her own flesh and blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey reveled in her newfound wealth, her ego swelling every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within a matter of days, she had gathered more than ten designer bags, and her wardrobe was now stocked with the latest high-fashion pieces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t bothered to visit the Todd family once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny,growing more anxious by the day, finally decided he couldn&#39;t wait any longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a nagging unease, he drove directly to the Benton family&#39;s villa. Relaxing on the sofa with a face mask after her beauty treatment, Lainey shot him an impatient look. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look in her eyes didn&#39;t escape Jonny&#39;s notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting his teeth, he stared at her. &#34;You&#39;re my wife. You&#39;ve been gone for days. Don&#39;t you think you owe me an explanation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey erupted into laughter, sitting up straight. &#34;An explanation? What are you even talking about? Don&#39;t tell me you actually thought I would have my dad invest in your firm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her laughter echoed as she removed the mask, revealing a face that was both beautiful and dripping with mockery. &#34;I was just fooling you.&#34;</p>
