                <p>Nolan shot Hector a meaningful glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on immediately, Hector gently helped Norwood to his room to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, several bodyguards dressed in black strode in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart, they&#39;ve gone,&#34; one of them said, bowing his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a curt nod, his tone cool and clipped.&#34;Double the security around the estate. From this moment on, Colson is not to set foot anywhere near it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood.&#34; The guards accepted the command without question and slipped away as silently as they would arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan then pulled out his phone and fired off a message to Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find out which hotel Colson is holed up in. Deliver a warning-he has got three days to clear out of Elepdon, or he&#39;ll learn the hard way what  consequences look like.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that business settled, Nolan finally turned to Eleanor. She stood beside him, her face taut with worry.&#34;Baby, really-I&#39;m fine. Don&#39;t trouble yourself.It&#39;s late. Let me take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in his steady voice reassured Eleanor, and the tension in her shoulders eased. &#34;Alright,&#34; she agreed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Colson and Ady had just returned to their suite at the Lumina Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie,who had been pacing in the living room,rushed over the instant they walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad,how did it go wvith Grandpa?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson ripped off his jacket and tossed it carelessly onto the couch, his face dark with irritation. &#34;Don&#39;t even get me started,&#34; he barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting had gone worse than he ever imagined.After all these years, Nolan of all people called the shots in the Stewart family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had not only thrown him out in front of Norwood but issued orders as if the family crown already sat on his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since when did Nolan hold all the reins? Ady was just as furious; she turned her fire squarely on Colson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because of Nolan, Brodie got sent packing from Zerovia, your assets are frozen solid, and now we&#39;re barred from our own home! If you don&#39;t come up with a plan soon, the three of us will be tossed out of Elepdon with nothing but the clothes on our backs!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her wrath boil over, Colson scrambled to soothe her. &#34;Baby, don&#39;t work yourself up. I promise -I won&#39;t let you or Brodie suffer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no sooner had the words left his mouth than a soft knock sounded at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie, being closest, went to open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the threshold stood Erick, sharp in a tailored black suit, his face carved in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His icy gaze slid past Brodie and locked on Colson lounging in the living room. &#34;My boss&#39;s orders are simple,&#34; he said flatly. &#34;You have three days to leave Elepdon. Fail to comply, and we&#39;ll personally see you escorted out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Colson could open his mouth, Brodie shot forward, bristling with indignation. &#34;And who the hell do you think you are, barging in here and threatening us like that?&#34; Erick&#39;s eyes never wavered-cold, steady, not even the flicker of a brow. &#34;I&#39;m simply carrying out orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, almost dismissive nod, he turned on his heel and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut, and a heavy silence settled over the suite like a suffocating fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady&#39;s composure shattered. She crumpled into Colson&#39;s arms, striking his chest with trembling fists.&#34;Did you hear him, Colson? Three days! He means to corner us!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s face darkened. With a snarl, he slammed his fist against the coffee table, the sound reverberating through the room. His jaw clenched tight, teeth grinding. &#34;I&#39;m his father! I refuse to be driven out like some beggar. Let&#39;s see just how far he dares push me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them convinced themselves that Nolan was bluffing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, they resolved to remain at the Lumina Hotel,daring Nolan to make good on his threat.</p>
