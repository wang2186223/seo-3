                <p>At the campsite on the city&#39;s edge, Nolan sat watching Fannie and Elora frolicking on the grass. Though a faint smile curved his lips, his mind wandered, pulled elsewhere by an uneasy thought gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slipped out his phone, intending to message Eleanor, wanting to know her location and what kept her busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before his fingers moved, a sharp ping rang out-a notification from the Elepdon social circle group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That chat existed for emergencies only, rarely checked, with Nolan&#39;s strict warning that no one disturb him without urgent cause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who dared to tag him now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased his face as he tapped into the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the feed made his veins burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first image was of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat in a booth bathed in neon light, flanked by several stylish men, with Lillian slouched drunkenly beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following that came a brief clip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, words slurred and heavy, rambled about finding Eleanor a man with an eight-pack, while Eleanor failed to resist an escort leaning in close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan could not bear to watch longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had assumed Eleanor missed the trip because something important held her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet this was the truth? Drinking with Lillian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HHis hand stabbed at the screen as he sent a terse message in the group chat. &#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those three words carried the weight of a brewing storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence swallowed the group. Members cursed themselves for tagging Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he had already seen everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a nervous reply appeared. &#34;Paradise Bar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping the phone into his pocket, Nolan snatched his car keys and strode toward the parking lot, rage radiating like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a distance, Fannie and Elora heard the car roar alive and realized Nolan had gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged confused looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What urgent matter pulled him away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside Paradise Bar,Eleanor remained oblivious to the turmoil forming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alcohol dulled her senses, wrapping her thoughts in fog.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian lay sprawled across the booth, fists banging the table while muttering about Fraser being a creep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head, trying to clear it, then checked her watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was already past ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone screen showed several missed calls from Hilda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly texted. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m with Lillian. Everything&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tucking the phone into her bag, she bent toward the staggering Lillian, preparing to head home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nearby escort seized the moment. &#34;Both of you look wasted. It&#39;s late. Let us walk you back. Nights like this aren&#39;t safe.&#34; Fogged by alcohol, Eleanor gave a faint nod, too hazy to think clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thrilled, the escort slipped one arm around Eleanor, the other around Lillian, and started for the exit with a smug grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they reached the door, a fierce kick dropped him flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never even saw who struck before darkness took him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock jolted Eleanor&#39;s senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze in disbelief, meeting a pair of blazing eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be with Elora right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the thought flashed across her mind, Nolan, fury radiating from him, advanced steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other escorts sensed danger and fled, dragging their unconscious friend along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the chaotic booth grew still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor steadied her throbbing head and forced a faint smile. &#34;Enjoy yourself. It&#39;s late. I&#39;m taking Lillian home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached toward Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her hand touched, Nolan caught it and yanked her close, grip unyielding.</p>
