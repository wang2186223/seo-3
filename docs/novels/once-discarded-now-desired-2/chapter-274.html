                <p>The next morning, Eleanor learned about the turmoil surrounding the Stewart Group from the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone screen dimmed gradually, and her fingers tightened with sudden tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Perry family, holding certain sway in political circles, would never act without concrete proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan must be grappling with a difficult situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, she decided to text Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertips hovered briefly, typed a few words,then erased them with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to know how he was holding up and offer support if he needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she knew such questions might only burden him  further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man as proud as Nolan would never reveal weakness to outsiders, much less to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he required now was not idle concern but unwavering faith.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any intrusion from her would merely distract him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to place her trust entirely in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that realization, Eleanor set her phone aside,swallowing the rush of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a peculiar restlessness lingered in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan must be swamped, and he was probably skipping meals again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she called the driver. &#34;Prepare the car. I need to run to the nearby supermarket.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver responded promptly, his tone respectful,&#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two hours passed, and Eleanor emerged carrying  two heavy grocery bags.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she headed toward the car parked along the curb,two familiar figures caught her eye under a sunshade nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Wray and Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of the Stewart Group&#39;s crisis made her pause instinctively, then she moved closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Wray&#39;s exasperated voice rang out.&#34;Trudy! What exactly are you up to? You&#39;ve nearly destroyed me! I&#39;ve lost my CEO position and now face legal trouble. I&#39;m warning you, tell your family to back off. Otherwise, everyone will know you&#39;re responsible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy stirred her coffee lazily, her composure completely unshaken. &#34;Instead of threats,you should convince Nolan to honor the marriage agreement.Otherwise, the Stewart Group will collapse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confidence soared, bolstered by Tyler&#39;s support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She no longer just wanted to be Nolan&#39;s lawful wife;  she wanted him kneeling, begging for her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray seethed at her audacity, yet found no words to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood that even exposing the truth would accomplish nothing against Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, the former chief financial officer appointed by Brodie was corrupt, and the current tax problem was entirely his responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Perry family was merely exploiting the situation to exert pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Wray silent, Trudy sneered, her gaze full of disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened her dress, rose elegantly, and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her back turned, Eleanor remained unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray,however, noticed immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed toward her, voice sharp with accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You troublemaker! This is your fault! Had you not  provoked Trudy, the Stewart Group wouldn&#39;t be in this chaos, and I&#39;d still be the thriving interim CEO!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had no desire to argue with a man like Wray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored him completely and slid into her car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes followed Trudy&#39;s departing figure, a frown forming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hadn&#39;t anticipated that the Perrys were merely pressuring Nolan to force concessions, and that Trudy would go so far to make Nolan marry her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Nolan faced immense challenges this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she believed he could endure and prevail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached home and prepared to start cooking, her phone rang. It was Hilda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I heard about the Stewart Group,&#34; Hilda said cautiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on the phone tightened, memories of yesterday&#39;s photo flashing in her mind. Hadn&#39;t Hilda endured so many hardships over the years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she lingered in thought, Hilda&#39;s anxious voice came again. &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t worry. Your father and I will definitely support them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor snapped back to reality, intending to decline,yet somehow replied, &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice sounded awkward, leaving Hilda utterly stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after hanging up, Hilda remained frozen in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, standing beside her, caught her reaction and quickly asked, &#34;Honey, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda turned toward him, her expression brightening with joy. &#34;Jeff, Eleanor just accepted our help and thanked me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this mean she was beginning to forgive them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff understood immediately, and elation washed  over him. &#34;That&#39;s wonderful, truly wonderful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They embraced, tears streaming as relief and happiness overwhelmed them.</p>
