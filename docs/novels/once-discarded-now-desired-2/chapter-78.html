                <p>Nolan lifted his brows, putting on that innocent look of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Think of it as my way of marking my territory,&#34; he said with a playful grin.&#34;At least now your ex will think twice before bothering you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,so should she thank him for that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor bit back a groan, forced a polite smile, and slipped out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hopped into the first taxi she could flag down and blurted, &#34;Please, hurry. Drive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She acted as though something terrifying was right on her heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not too far off, Erick was still frozen in disbelief, his jaw practically on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He edged toward Nolan, testing the waters with a cautious, &#34;Boss, aren&#39;t you going after her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t move. If anything, his grin only grew more cunning. &#34;No hurry,&#34; he drawled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, some things couldn&#39;t be rushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Push too hard, and she would only run further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Eleanor made it back to herapartment, she was finally catching her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Lillian popped up, grinning like she had been waiting all day for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Weli, well, I saw Nolan&#39;s post. So, when will you agree to be his girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shoved her aside, grabbed a glass, and poured herself some water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s decent, I won&#39;t deny that. But my hands are full right now. Between my career, the orphanage, and trying to help more kids, I don&#39;t have room for all that. &#34; She sighed and muttered, &#34;And who even knows if he&#39;s serious? Someone like Nolan wouldn&#39;t actually look twice at a divorced woman like me. He&#39;s probably just settling an old score from years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian wasn&#39;t buying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had known Nolan since childhood, and if there was one thing she was sure of, it was that the man didn&#39;t say things he didn&#39;t mean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twice he had confessed, and that wasn&#39;t something he would do for fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched Eleanor sink into her doubts, Lillian&#39;s mind was already spinning with plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, she quietly sent a few messages Nolan&#39;s way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, the following morning, Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed with a message from Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A miracle happened last night. A generous company stepped in and donated several prime land plots along with a huge sum of money to Hope House. I was thinking, maybe this is the right time to open more branches? That way, we can welcome more kids. Drop by when you can and see for yourself, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached were pictures and official papers showing the transfer of ownership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor scrolled through them, and her eyes widened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stewart Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in such prime areas?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Nolan insane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moves like this would cost the company billions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely his family wouldn&#39;t just sit quietly about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was in a blur of confusion, and before she knew it, she was opening Nolan&#39;s Facebook page as if something unseen had guided her there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh update stared back at her: &#34;Still working on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he was serious? His confession was more than just a passing impulse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could process further, her phone rang, and Besty&#39;s name flashed on the screen. &#34;Boss, the finals are next week, but we still don&#39;t have the final content locked in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That instantly reminded Eleanor of Jonny&#39;s smug attitude yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even seen Lainey&#39;s earlier drafts yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether Lainey had been cheating or not, everything would be clear in the final round.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor curved her lips into a faint smile and gave her instructions. &#34;Tell every finalist that during the finals,they&#39;ll need to present a complete gown based on their earlier sketches. It has to be worn, either by themselves or on a model. That way we can judge their full ability.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Got it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, Eleanor made her way/to Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she found there surprised her even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewart Group had already sent in a professional team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just covering the construction, but they also had mapped out the project plan, secured workers, and even arranged long-term funding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, opening new branches barely needed her or Myah&#39;s involvement at all.</p>
