                <p>Nolan&#39;s voice rang through the corridors, fast but sharp enough to be heard clearly. &#34;Anyone with AB blood who qualifies to donate, please head to the emergency room on the second floor.Afterward,you can collect a reward of $10,000 from the Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, he had thought about offering a million, but the thought of people faking eligibility and overwhelming the medical staff made him hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten thousand was enough to draw a crowd without causing chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He repeated the message again and again until he was sure it had reached every corner of the hospital.Only then did he leave the broadcast room and return to the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor just stared at him, dumbfounded. Could something like this really work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his surprise, it did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, people rushed in from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, ten thousand dollars was no small sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To earn that much from a single blood donation was almost like stumbling on a once-in-a-lifetime windfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than five minutes, the nurses&#39; station by/the emergency room was packed with volunteers ready to donate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the blood steadily made its way into the operating room, Nolan finally exhaled the breath he had been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed the doctor&#39;s hand and asked quickly,&#34;Will this be enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor blinked, as though snapping out of a daze, and nodded. &#34;Yes. It&#39;s enough.&#34; Hearing that, Nolan made his way towards the operating room and waited outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Jeff and Hilda arrived, having caught the announcement while entering the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason Nolan would be this desperate... was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s chest tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved her husband toward the nurse station in panic. &#34;Jeff, you&#39;re AB blood type too! Go donate!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff froze in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was AB too?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blood type wasn&#39;t exactly rare, but it wasn&#39;t common either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really just coincidence?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, something inside him softened. All the bitterness and the judgment he had carried seemed to crumble. Yet, when they reached the nurses&#39; station, the nurse informed them that the needed blood had already been collected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff stepped back, standing quietly by Hilda,who looked stricken with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Lillian saw them but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, no one cared about grudges or misunderstandings. In that moment, all they wanted was the same thing-for Eleanor to survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the red light above the operating room door switched off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan shot forward instantly. &#34;Doctor, how is she?&#34;he asked anxiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor pulled off his mask, looking tired but relieved. &#34;Thanks to the timely blood transfusion, the patient was very lucky. She made it through. They&#39;ll be bringing her out shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s knees buckled, and he staggered a few steps before managing to steady himself. Even though he was still a bit shaken, he also felt an immense sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was safe, and that was all that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him, the others let out a collective breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda almost fell over, but Jeff held her up just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched with a cold look but held back from making the usual sharp comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their worry for Eleanor seemed real, and she didn&#39;t want to cause a scene right then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Eleanor was pushed out of the operating room, lying still on the hospital bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were shut tight, her face pale as paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked fragile, breakable even, and the sight tugged painfully at everyone who cared for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan walked alongside the gurney, gripping the rail as the doctors pushed her toward the VIP ward on the top floor. Right behind them was Denny, also being wheeled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since he had served the Benton family for so many years, Jeff and Hilda immediately stepped forward,their voices anxious as they asked the doctor,&#34;How is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They hadn&#39;t been there earlier to hear the update, so the doctor replied calmly, &#34;He&#39;s fine. The airbags spared him from serious injury. It&#39;s only a mild concussion. He fainted from the shock, but with some rest, he&#39;ll recover completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you,&#34; Jeff and Hilda said over and over, their relief evident as they followed the staff escorting Denny to his ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda wanted to go up to the top floor as well, to see Eleanor, but deep down she knew Nolan wouldn&#39;t allow it right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, how could she face Eleanor? If she hadn&#39;t asked her out that day, there wouldn&#39;t have been an accident. Guilt consumed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her fault, all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in these thoughts, Hilda broke down and rushed out of the room in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff quickly told a bodyguard to stay behind, then rushed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found her shaking with sobs, and he gently patted her shoulder, awkward in his attempt to comfort. &#34;Sweetheart, don&#39;t do this to yourself. It&#39;s not your fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hilda couldn&#39;t be soothed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She buried her face against his chest, crying until her body ached with exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally lifted her head, her eyes were red and swollen. &#34;Jeff, I don&#39;t care whether you accept Eleanor or not. In my heart, she is my daughter.I&#39;m not asking for your approval, but you can&#39;t stop me from seeing her again. Never again!&#34; Her voice broke as she spoke. She had come close to losing Eleanor forever, and that kind of fear left no room for hesitation. From now on,she only wanted to stay by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Hilda&#39;s determination, Jeff didn&#39;t argue and simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His own chest felt heavy with emotions he couldn&#39;t sort out.</p>
