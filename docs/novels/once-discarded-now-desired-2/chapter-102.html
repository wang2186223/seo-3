                <p>Lillian had been scrolling through comments when one in particular caught her attention. Someone boldly suggested that Enigma might actually be Butterfly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she saw it. As Eleanor&#39;s number-one fan,she never missed a single post, reply, or rumor tied to her best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the thought left her fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor,hiding something this big from her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching her purse off the sofa, she marched out the door and waited until Eleanor arrived back at her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Eleanor appeared,Lillian crossed her arms,with her best &#34;serious interrogator&#34; look, and demanded, &#34;Alright, tell me the truth, are you Butterfly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze, then let out a small sigh.&#34;Whether I am or not, I&#39;m still your best friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all Lillian needed. Knowing Eleanor as well as she did, the lack of denial was practically an admission.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was actually Butterfly-the legendary collector everyone talked about!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock lasted about two seconds before her inner drama queen burst forth. She grabbed Eleanor&#39;s arm,fake-crying like she was in a soap opera. &#34;How could you keep something this huge from me? Do you even love me as a friend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed out a few tears for effect, then immediately demanded, &#34;You have to make it up to me! I want a seaside vacation in Asnoyle, and you&#39;re coming with me. No excuses!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with Lillian&#39;s theatrics, Eleanor could only give in with a helpless nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Asnoyle, on Elepdon&#39;s eastern coast, was a hotspot for tourists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian&#39;s dreamy plan for a quiet, two-person getaway was shattered the moment they arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wherever Eleanor went, whispers and squeals followed. &#34;Wait, isn&#39;t that Enigma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s even prettier in real life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick, let&#39;s ask for her autograph!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within mninutes, they were swarmed. Lillian instantly regretted everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t a beach trip. This was a full-blown fan event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the universe wasn&#39;t done messing with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all people, they bumped straight into Jonny and Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s face soured the second she saw Eleanor soaking up the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a smug little sway in her steps, she sauntered over and lowered her voice so only Eleanor and Lillian could hear. &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t get too comfortable. Once my parents return, my status will soar. And when that happens, I&#39;ll have countless ways to deal with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t even bother glancing at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Lainey was, in her opinion, the sharpest response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t built for patience. Planting her hands firmly on her hips, she glared at Lainey and snapped, &#34;Are you blind? Move it. You&#39;re in our way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey,now carrying herself like she was a Benton,clearly didn&#39;t think much of the Brooks family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding her arms with a smug tilt of her chin, she smirked. &#34;Enjoy your pride while it lasts. When the time comes, we&#39;ll see how tough you really act in front of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She threw one last disdainful look at Lillian before strutting off, with Jonny following close behind like a loyal little sidekick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s temper flared. She stomped her foot and shouted after her, &#34;Who does she think she is? So what if she really is a Benton? Big deal! We&#39;ve got Nolan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but laugh at her friend&#39;s fiery outburst. She reached over and soothed, &#34;Don&#39;t let her get under your skin. She&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,looking slightly sheepish,Eleanor added,&#34;By the way,if you still want to hang out, we&#39;d better make the most of today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian narrowed her eyes, suspicious. &#34;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&#34; Avoiding her gaze, Eleanor touched her nose and admitted, &#34;Dyer messaged me. They just found a cluster of ancient tombs in Otrad, and he wants me there the day after tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone softened with guilt. &#34;So, for a while, I probably won&#39;t have much time for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s anger instantly froze on her face, but it quickly crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes welled up, and she burst into loud sobs.&#34;Why is my life so pitiful?&#34; she cried miserably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On one hand, she felt secretly proud that her best friend was such an important figure. But on the other hand, whenever Eleanor&#39;s work called, she was gone without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How unlucky was she to have a best friend like that?Lillian&#39;s chest ached with grievances, and she couldn&#39;t help but feel wronged.</p>
