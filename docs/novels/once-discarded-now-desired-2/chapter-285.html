                <p>The luxury resort stood in a perfect spot, framed by rugged mountains on one side and endless ocean on the other, its scenery truly mesmerizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every villa boasted a secluded outdoor bath, letting guests unwind in total privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had settled in and left their bags behind,Eleanor and Nolan didn&#39;t waste any time as they quickly changed into their swimsuits and made their way out to the steaming bath in their private courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor dipped her hand into the water to check if the temperature was just right, let out a satisfied sigh, and was the first to slide in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the soothing warmth surrounded her, the stress and fatigue she had carried for days seemed to dissolve completely. Nolan soon joined her, stretching his long legs into the pool and settling down beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back against the edge, steam curling around him while a few damp strands of hair clung to his forehead, giving him a relaxed, almost inviting look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful spark flashed in Eleanor&#39;s eyes as she glanced over at Nolan, struck by a sudden urge to cause trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, she scooped up some water and sent a splash right at Nolan&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected attack left Nolan momentarily confused, his eyes wide. But the moment he spotted the victorious grin on Eleanor&#39;s face, that confusion faded,replaced by a look of fond amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than scolding her, Nolan simply grinned and sent a wave of water right back, using his strong hands to make sure she got drenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a surprised giggle and quickly tried to dodge out of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter and splashes echoed around the small</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pool, making them feel like carefree kids again as they lost themselves in a spontaneous water fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught up in the fun, Eleanor stepped backward onto the smooth pebbles. In her excitement, she lost her footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A startled yelp escaped her lips as she slipped, her body tipping backward out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the painful fall she had braced for never arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An instant later, a firm hand caught her waist and pulled her safely back, steadying her in a protective hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan kept her close, his arms secure as he spoke,his tone edged with gentle warning. &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could feel his chest pressed warmly against her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only the thin fabric separating them, she became acutely aware of the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, each pulse syncing with her own in a way that left her flustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His familiar, invigorating scent filled the air, and color rushed to her cheeks, leaving them bright red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dusk slowly crept in, and the last traces of daylight faded from the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crisp mountain breeze drifted in, swirling the pool&#39;s steam and making the air feel noticeably cooler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight tremor ran through Eleanor as the chill set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her discomfort, Nolan quickly let go and touched her forehead before checking his own for a fever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was sure she was alright, Nolan breathed out in relief and said, &#34;The temperature&#39;s dropped.Wait here. I&#39;ll grab our clothes from inside. After we change, I&#39;ll bring you out for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor responded with an easy nod. &#34;Alright.&#34; Still worried, Nolan repeated his instructions before stepping out of the bath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor watched him stride away, a towel draped around his shoulders, and found herself unexpectedly uneasy as she looked at his retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did that odd feeling linger inside her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crease formed on her brow as she slipped deeper beneath the soothing water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan made his way down the hall and stopped at the bedroom door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door hung open just a crack, probably left that way by housekeeping after their evening rounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without giving it a second thought, he nudged the door and walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right away, a cloying, unfamiliar fragrance overwhelmed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong. A jolt of instinctive alarm shot through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, dizziness crashed over him, and he staggered, fighting to stay on his feet. A fierce,burning heat started low in hisabdomen and spread quickly, making it almost impossible to think straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as his vision began to blur, a pair of delicate arms slipped around his neck from behind, holding him tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of a woman pressed firmly against his back. &#34;Nolan, I&#39;ve missed you,&#34; she whispered softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tried to break free, but his strength seemed to drain away in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy scent lingered, clouding his senses and wearing down his resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disoriented, Nolan slowly turned to face the woman behind him. His gaze blurred and shifted, but as her features sharpened, all he could see was Eleanor&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat bobbed as he struggled for breath, and before he could stop himself, he whispered the only name that mattered to him. &#34;Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful smirk vanished from Trudy&#39;s lips in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes blazed with outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again,it was Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when Nolan was drugged out of his senses, the only person he ever thought about was that bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it fair?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did Eleanor always end up on top, while she herself was left to scrape by in the shadows?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the White family had lost everything, Trudy had been stuck living with her parents in a shabby,run-down rental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel, who once treated her like a princess, now took out every frustration on her, whether through harsh words or heavy hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her days were filled with misery, and she was completely worn down by it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Trudy refused to let her life stay that way, and swore she would claw her way back into the world of the wealthy and powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, the key was simple: as long as she became Nolan&#39;s woman, nothing would be out of reach again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing her bitterness aside, she leaned into Nolan&#39;s faint whisper and replied in a gentle tone, &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent weeks carefully orchestrating this night, slipping the staff a bribe and waiting patiently for her chance in Nolan&#39;s bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, everything had fallen into place. That tonight,her plan would finally succeed, and Eleanor would finally learn what it felt like to lose everything.</p>
