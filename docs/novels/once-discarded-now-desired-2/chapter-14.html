                <p>Jonny stiffened when he heard Emma&#39;s words, his face losing its calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his eyes away and muttered under his breath, &#34;Cut the act, Emma. Don&#39;t stir up drama in front of Mr. Stewart, or you&#39;ll drag our family into a disaster we can&#39;t handle. Understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the mess Emma created had reached an outrageous one and a half billion. That figure was enough to crush half of the Todd Group overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s jaw tightened as she bit back her anger.&#34;Eleanor is a seductress. She flirts-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s voice exploded before she could finish.&#34;said shut it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden rage in his tone made Emma flinch. Her shoulders drew in as tears welled up, spilling over in  helpless sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s fists curled at his sides, his eyes narrowing on the place where Eleanor and Nolan had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made no sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was too influential to waste his attention on Eleanor, who was ordinary, bland, and nothng more than a divorced country woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason he stepped in must have been to avoid ruining David&#39;s mnood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explanation settled in Jonny&#39;s mind, giving him a bitter sort of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny yanked Emma by the wrist and steered her into a dim corner. His voice dropped low and sharp as he warned, &#34;Keep your mouth shut tonight, or don&#39;t expect a single cent from me next month.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s sobbing stopped in an instant. She blinked at him, stunned by the threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she swallowed her words and stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Nolan, with Eleanor in his arms,entered the VIP lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland hurried after them with a medical kit tucked against his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A curious gleam lit his eyes. He wanted to see more,yet he tried hard not to make it obvious, which gave him a strangely funny air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kit was set neatly on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give you two some space.&#34; With that, he darted out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stared at the closed door, uneasy with the way he had phrased it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about his tone didn&#39;t sound right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could dwell on it, a sharp pain jolted through her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Eleanor let out a sharp breath and immediately glanced down at her ankle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&lt;</p>
