                <p>Nolan said nothing as he lowered himself onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray, unable to contain his excitement, bent forward in a deep bow. &#34;Nolan, Norwood, you can count on me. I&#39;ll give it everything I have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood kept his face unreadable while signaling the butler to escort Wray out. &#34;See that he gets some rest,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler guided Wray away, and the weight of the wooden door echoed as it shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood reached for the cup beside him and took a slow sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thin veil of steam rose, briefly concealing the sharp edge in his gaze. &#34;Cut ties with that woman, and the Usepsall project stays under your control. There&#39;s room to bargain,&#34;Norwood said. &#34;If not, then surrender half of the Stewart Group&#39;s shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no doubt how Nolan would choose the first option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been the one to raise the boy. He knew Nolan&#39;s weaknesses, his sense of duty that often outweighed his own emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewart Group was the pride of his entire life.He would never allow another to take it from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan abandoned that woman, everything could return to the way it once was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan&#39;s voice was calm and steady as he answered, &#34;Grandpa, if you want to take the company back, I&#39;ll see to it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s hand trembled, sending hot coffee sloshing over the rim, though he barely noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was ready to give up the Stewart Group for a Norwood studied his grandson&#39;s unnervingly calm expression, and for the first time, he felt as though the boy was a stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand shot up, trembling as he tried to form words. &#34;How could you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan bent forward in a polite bow, his voice steady.&#34;If l&#39;ve upset you, then I&#39;ll take my leave and not trouble you further,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he turned and walked away,showing no hint of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage clouded Norwood&#39;s sight until the room spun,leaving him gasping for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he possibly manage a corporation when his body was failing him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harsh truth was that his threats had been nothing but a bluff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Nolan&#39;s stubbornness revealed he truly didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pure, reckless insanity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was a woman worth more than the Stewart Group itself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By then, Nolan had already stepped outside and slid into the Bentley waiting by the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft rap landed on the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray stood there, his posture bent in forced humility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, I look forward to working with you at the company. I just took charge of the Usepsall project,but I&#39;m short-handed. Could you lend me the assistant who&#39;s been helping you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick gripped the steering wheel, his shoulders going rigid as unease prickled down his back. He couldn&#39;t believe how clueless the young man outside really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window slid down with deliberate slowness, and  Nolan&#39;s eyes locked on Wray, sharp enough to cut.&#34;And you think you have the right to ask me that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Wray&#39;s face collapsed in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there seething as the Bentley pulled away,its exhaust cloud swallowing him whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a furious stomp, Wray cursed under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What gave Nolan the right to act so high and mighty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Norwood&#39;s favoritism, he would be nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once I deliver results with the Usepsall project and prove my worth, let&#39;s see who truly runs the Stewart Group,&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Erick glanced nervously at his employer through the mirror, words balancing on the tip of his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, are you really fine with your grandfather letting.Wray handle the Usepsall project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project&#39;s weight was undeniable. It was too valuable to be trusted to anyone careless. Nolan reclined against the leather seat,drumming his fingers lightly on the armrest as though the matter were trivial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden laugh broke from him, but it carried no warmth, only coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa just needs entertainment. Let him toy around with that fool if it keeps him busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick caught the message right away. He nodded quickly and chose to keep silent.</p>
