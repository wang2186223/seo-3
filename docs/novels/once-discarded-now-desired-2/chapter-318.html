                <p>The next morning, Eleanor carried her needles and headed to the hospital alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face lit up immediately he saw her. &#34;Eleanor, what are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor set the gift bag she had brought on the table and studied him. &#34;Norwood, what&#39;s going on with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood brushed aside talk of Colson&#39;s foolishness and shrugged. &#34;Nothing serious. Just old age catching up with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave him a quiet look. &#34;Let me check you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood was aware of her gift in medicine. She had eased his, pain before, so he chuckled and nodded.&#34;Alright, then. Do your thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor opened her kit without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands moved swiftly, placing the needles with steady precision.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, warmth spread from each point, flowing through his body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tightness in his chest lifted, vanishing like smoke in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood felt like a new man:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled someone once mentioned that Eleanor might be the Soul Surgeon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t believed it then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, feeling the change in hisbody, he knew her skill was no ordinary thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He realized he had almost made a grave mistake-treating a rare treasure like it was nothing special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He caught the shadow in Eleanor&#39;s eyes, his sharp instincts kicking in. &#34;Don&#39;t let that fool Nolan get to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;s upset you, scold him or kick his ass. Don&#39;t hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused, her hands still as she packed her needles. She lowered her gaze, hiding the storm in her eyes. &#34;I&#39;ve been busy lately. I don&#39;t have time for relationship troubles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s years of wisdom told him the truth-she was shutting her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who could blame her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t push; he only played along. &#34;That&#39;s the way to go. Focus on yourself. When Nolan finally realizes what he&#39;s done, you can decide whether he deserves another chance. That&#39;ll teach him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave no answer. She simply packed her needles, slipped them back into her bag, and said softly,&#34;Take care of yourself and rest well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleaned up, then rose to leave. &#34;I still have things to do, so I&#39;ll get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood watched her walk away with a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His foolish grandson was about to lose her for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospital lobby, Eleanor spotted Nolan and Fannieheading her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without slowing, she kept her eyes forward, blending into the crowd until she slipped out the doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Fannie stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the doors slid shut, Fannie frowned at the passing crowd. &#34;Nolan, I think I just saw Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan instinctively looked out, but she was already gone. He shook his head. &#34;You must&#39;ve been mistaken.If she were here, she would&#39;ve greeted me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie clicked her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, Nolan was as self-absorbed as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After visiting his grandfather, Nolan went back to the villa in Regal Heights. He called Erick. &#34;Clear my schedule for the next two day/s. I&#39;ll be spending them with Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick nearly groaned but replied at once, &#34;Yes,boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Elora overheard. She slipped into her room and quickly sent a message to Ady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came almost immediately. &#34;Do whatever you can to ruin it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora bit her lip and typed back, &#34;Will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set her phone down with a quiet thought. &#34;Sory, Nolan. What we have matters, but protecting mylife matters more.&#34;</p>
