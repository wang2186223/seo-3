                <p>Eleanor felt a surge of satisfaction and leaned in to press a soft kiss against Nolan&#39;s lips &#34;Feeling better now?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan froze for a heartbeat, pleasantly surprised, and instinctively leaned in to deepen it, but Eleanor gently pushed him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; she said softly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for Nolan&#39;s recent considerate behavior,she wouldn&#39;t have made the first move</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got the hint and stepped back with a sly smile,quickly returning to his usual calm and confident self</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his hands in his pockets, he looked at her with curiosity. &#34;So, are there still things about you l don&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him a sharp glare and returned to her cleaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a beat, she muttered, &#34;No comment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nolan left the orphanage, he couldn&#39;t suppress that bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick blinked, stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been years since Nolan had smiled like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before Erick could tease him, Nolan&#39;s piercing gaze pinned him to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart...&#34; Erick straightened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drive,&#34; Nolan ordered, his eyes still sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Erick replied, obedient as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the good mood didn&#39;t last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone buzzed, and he saw that his grandfather was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know what&#39;s going on.&#34; Norwood&#39;s voice was firm.&#34;But you and her? Forget it Don&#39;t even think&lt;about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear that Norwood would never accept Eleanor as his granddaughter-in-law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, a woman who had captured Nolan&#39;s heart simply didn&#39;t fit the family&#39;s expectations</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted someone from a similar background and social standing,someone who could match Nolan in every way. Nolan knew exactly what his grandfather meant, but he refused to back down. &#34;Grandpa, I understand your concerns. I&#39;ll prove it to you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t agree.&#34; Norwood cut him off, hanging up before Nolan could finish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Nolan stared at the dimming screen,a determined glint in his cold eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, pulling out his phone, he typed a message to Eleanor. &#34;Together forever, no matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that exact moment, Eleanor took a sip of soup and nearly choked on it. &#34;Seriously?&#34; she muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First a proposal, and now this mysterious message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he upset, serious, or just being dramatic? She had no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before she could ponder further, Myah&#39;s concerned voice came from beside her. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? You seem distracted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s curious eyes fell on Eleanor&#39;s face, and seeing the faint blush, she immediately understood. &#34;Alright,finish your meal, then go enjoy your romance. That young man... he really does care about you.&#34; Eleanor felt jealous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s barely been a short while, and you&#39;re already on his side?&#34; she muttered softly, jealousy creeping into her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah rolled her eyes playfully. &#34;Enough whining. Eat,then get back to your work. Don&#39;t worry about the Hope House. I&#39;ve got it covered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a sullen &#34;oh&#34; and quickly finished her meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After cleaning up, she stared at Nolan&#39;s earlier message,lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head slightly, bemused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had only just started seeing each other, and he was already dropping lines like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Lillian have been right? Maybe the Stewarts really did dive headfirst into love without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Eleanor considered it, the more it seemed believable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being a shrewd business tycoon, Nolan might just be a hopeless romantic. Well, maybe she should treat hima little better from now on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone deserved a bit of indulgence for being a hopeless romantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan had no inkling that his impulsive,heartfelt message might make him look foolish.Had he known, he would have deleted it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, at the Todd famnily&#39;s residence,Lainey was far from laughing. She gripped her phone so tightly her knuckles went white, finally hurling it to the floor in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those relentless netizens! Somehow, they had tracked her down again, and their insults were growing harsher by the hour. How could they find her, even after she changed her IP and stayed anonymous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But soon, she reminded herself, soon she would officially be a Benton. Those lowly online critics didn&#39;t matter. Nothing could touch her once she had that kind of power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the real thorn in her side wasn&#39;t the Internet.It was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every time she thought she had her rival cornered,Eleanor slipped through her fingers unscathed. The thought made Lainey&#39;s chest tighten with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to accept it. She wouldn&#39;t accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, having seen the online commotion, looked equally stunned. Eleanor&#39;s latest charitable donation had made waves, and somehow, Lainey had been behind those rumors all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet despite the shock, Jonny&#39;s attention shifted.He couldn&#39;t afford to lose Lainey after already losing Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Lainey was a Benton by blood, he had to keep her happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, he quickly pulled her into his arms,trying to soothe her. &#34;Hey, don&#39;t be upset. Tomorrow,we&#39;re heading to the beach. Just you and me,okay?Relax and forget about all this nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, with no other outlet for her anger, nodded obediently, though her mind was still simmering.</p>
