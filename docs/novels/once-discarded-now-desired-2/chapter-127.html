                <p>A murmur swept through the crowd as heads turned toward the source of the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striding toward them with an easygoing attitude, a blond man in a bright floral shirt and slipped his hands into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone quickly recognized him as Stephen Rowe, the celebrated host of the evening and the internationally acclaimed artist responsible for First Light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting a new chance to seize the spotlight, Lainey wasted no time replacing her furious look by a soft,almost fragile one as she hurried over to welcome him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From several paces away, she jabbed her finger in Eleanor&#39;s direction and called out, &#34;Mr. Rowe, you got here at the perfect moment! That&#39;s the one! She&#39;s the troublemaker. She&#39;s been making a scene at your event, hiding behind her boyfriend&#39;s status. During the interactive game, she trashed your artwork and made everyone else pretend to agree with her just because her boyfriend is influential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her entire story was a convincing show, cleverly twisting the facts to fit her own agenda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the other socialitês watched her performance with disbelief, but no one dared to intervene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen&#39;s expression darkened, his brows knitting together as clear distaste flashed across his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no patience for people who threw their weight around. To him, that was the ultimate disrespect to his art.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to hear what she has to say,&#34; Stephen replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Lainey could barely contain her excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain Stephen, with his refined taste, would have nothing but contempt for Eleanor,whom he considered shallow and shallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to drive her point, Lainey dramatically retold everything Eleanor had said before, blowing every detail out of proportion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey wasted no time twisting the story. &#34;You know what she said? According to her, your painting ought to be called Deliverance, because apparently, you&#39;re just sitting around hoping for redemption.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She punctuated her words with a mocking laugh. &#34;Honestly, can you believe it? It&#39;s ridiculous! Anyone with sense knows your artwork celebrates new beginnings, the beauty of the sunrise, and a fresh start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intent on dragging Eleanor&#39;s name through the mud, Lainey remained unaware of the shift in Stephen&#39;s expression, his eyes shining brighter with every word. He looked as if he had discovered a soulmate at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Lainey finished and thrown a smug glance Eleanor&#39;s way, Stephen raced across the room toward Eleanor, nearly tripping over himself in excitement. &#34;Incredible! You, my dear, are the first person who&#39;s ever truly grasped the meaning behind my art!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of searching had led him to this moment, a genuine connection with someone who saw straight to his soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw this unfold, Nolan&#39;s expression turned thunderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving without hesitation, he wrapped his arm protectively around Eleanor, holding her close as he fixed Stephen with a glare as cold as ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spoke with a quiet warning in his voice. &#34;I&#39;d appreciate it if you showed a little more respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flair for theatrics, Stephen pressed a hand to his heart, feigning deep distress. His vivid blue eyes practically shimmered with a sense of betrayal. &#34;Miss Warren, I&#39;m absolutely devastated. Your boyfriend is far too intimidating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s scowl only deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a sly piece of work!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor refused to let anyone stain Nolan&#39;s image.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently slipping from Nolan&#39;s hold, she offered Stephen a measured, courteous smile. &#34;Please don&#39;t take offense, Mr.Rowe. My boyfriend&#39;s only looking out for me, and he meant no harm. As for your idea that l understand you, but I wouldn&#39;t go that far. I just gave my interpretation of what you tried to express on canvas. There&#39;s really no reason to make such a big deal of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her message was unmistakable-there was no special bond, and he ought to keep his distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephen looked even more crestfallen at her response, but he straightened up and, with artistic grace,dipped into a formal bow. &#34;As you wish, Miss Warren. Still, if you two ever split up, let me be the first to know.I&#39;ll be here waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm brewed in Nolan&#39;s gaze, and it looked like he wás just a moment away from snapping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his growing irritation, Eleanor squeezed his hand gently, then turned to Stephen and politely shut him down. &#34;Thank you for the flattery, but that&#39;s never going to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room fell into stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody had expected Eleanor to have such a genuine understanding of art, let alone be the first to decode its true meaning!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became clear that Eleanor&#39;s appreciation surpassed that of even the so-called internationally renowned experts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Lainey even bother to do her homework before launching her little scheme?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she had really done was set herself up as the punchline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely nothing had gone according to Lainey&#39;s plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret hit her so hard it felt like a punch to the gut!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had shown up hoping to humiliate Eleanor, not hand her the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a nightmare!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was almost unbearable for her to accept!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,you infuriating bitch! Just you wait! One day, you&#39;ll regret ever crossing me!&#34; Cursing Eleanor under her breath, Lainey simmered with rage. She wouldd remember every humiliating second of this disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally took control of the Benton family, Eleanor would be the first on her list!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would see to it that Eleanor never had another chance to shine!</p>
