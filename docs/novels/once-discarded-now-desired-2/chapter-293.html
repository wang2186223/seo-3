                <p>The moment Hector&#39;s words left his mouth,Norwood&#39;s pleasant smile vanished completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth in his features drained away,replaced by a fierce, thunderous glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping his cane so tightly that the veins on his hand stood out, he snapped, &#34;Who allowed Colson back here? Throw him out this instant! I don&#39;t have a son like that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unfathomable to Norwood that Colson would dare to show up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Eleanor&#39;s fork paused in midair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help but glance over at Nolan to see his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Nolan&#39;s face had gone completely cold,his aura sharp and forbidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could react,a lazy voice drifted in from the entryway. &#34;Dad, I&#39;m home. Have you missed me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a man strolled casually into the room. He wore a striking designer suit, his hair dyed a vivid shade of gold, and a bold, mischievous grin played on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mistaking the man; it was Colson himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clinging tightly to his arm stood a woman draped in sparkling jewels, clearly eager to show off her affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Ady, the very woman Colson had chosen over his lawful wife and child, openly defying Norwood&#39;s authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Leave!&#34; The moment Norwood spotted Ady, his temper flared. He shot to his feet and swung his cane toward Coson. &#34;Don&#39;t you dare call me Dad! I have no son as shameful as you! And you dare parade that woman here? Get out of my sight! You&#39;re not welcome to this family. Go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson moved quickly, catching the cane mid-swing with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile lingered on his lips. He was untouched by Norwood&#39;s outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unsettling calm, he replied, &#34;Dad,all these years have passed, and you&#39;re still holding a grudge?Brodie&#39;s been back recently, hasn&#39;t he? You saw him,  right? I&#39;ve spent years guiding that boy. He&#39;s always saying he wants to come home and take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just hearing Brodie&#39;s name sent Norwood&#39;s temper flaring higher. &#34;Take care of me?&#34; he thought bitterly.&#34;That boy&#39;s done nothing but push me closer to my own grave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan rose to his feet, his expression glacial, eyes glinting with a chill that swept straight through Colson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without taking his gaze off Colson, he gave a curt command to the nearest servant. &#34;See them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s features hardened as he finally locked eyes with Nolan,resentment simmering beneath his surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his mind, Nolan was the reason he had been denied his rightful place as head of the Stewart Group, and why Brodie had been cut off from his future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, not only had Nolan claimed everything for himself, but he had also gone after Brodie, freezing all his assets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even forced them out of Zerovia,leaving them with nowhere else to turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their backs against the wall, Colson decided there was nothing left to lose. He had to come back and fight for what was his. Steeling himself, Colson put on a fatherly front.&#34;Nolan, it&#39;s been a long time. How have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention shifted to Eleanor, a flicker of interest in his gaze. &#34;So, this is the woman you&#39;ve fallen for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s response was cold and unyielding, his tone leaving no room for argument. &#34;Don&#39;t even try to claim any connection to us.Leave,now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s confident grin finally broke, and he jabbed a finger at Nolan, shouting furiously, &#34;You ungrateful brat! How dare you speak to your father that way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely got the words out before a squad of bodyguards in black stormed in, swiftly encircling him and Ady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he saw the show of force, Colson&#39;s bravado faded. He plastered on a forced grin, his tone suddenly meek. &#34;Hey, now, I was just messing around.I know l&#39;ve made mistakes over the years. I&#39;ll do better, I promise. Ady and I will try to make amends from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his attention to Norwood, he added, &#34;Dad,you and Nolan should get some rest. We won&#39;t trouble you anymore tonight.We&#39;ll come visit another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Colson grabbed the shaken Ady and ushered her out of the room. The moment the door closed behind them, Norwood&#39;s rigid posture collapsed; he looked as though every ounce of strength had left his body, sinking back into the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart!&#34; Hector rushed over to steady him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood slumped against the armrest, his breath ragged and uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He closed his eyes, waved Hector away weakly, and let out a weary sigh. &#34;What have I done to deserve such a son?&#34;</p>
