                <p>Trudy crept in, and traced Nolan&#39;s sculpted abs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The touch snapped Nolan back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything around him sharpened in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in front of him was Trudy-her face caked with makeup, eyes thick with artificial seduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had mistaken her for Eleanor due to the effects of the drug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgust rolled through him. Nolan pushed her away,hard.&#34;Get out.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy tumbled to the floor, shock etched across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gaped at him, stunned by the fury blazing in his eyes-an intensity she had never seen from him before. How was this happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That drug was supposed to take him down, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he still in control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart pounded in her chest, but she stepped in closer, her voice barely more than a whisper. &#34;Nolan,you&#39;re suffering. That stuff is brutal. Let me help, or you&#39;ll never make it through the night.&#34;</p>

                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes darted to the fruit knife glinting on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t hesitate-snatching the blade and dragging it across his own arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot blood spilled down his skin, the pain instantly cutting through the drug&#39;s haze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy could only stare, voice trembling. &#34;Have you lost your mind?&#34; Nolan would rather hurt himself than even touch her.Why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could possibly make Eleanor worth that kind of pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh wave of humiliation stung Trudy, and she lunged for him again, hands clawing desperately at his towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, stop fighting me. Let me take care of you,&#34;she pleaded, her voice breaking.</p>

                <p>Left in the hallway, Trudy shook with a mix of fear and disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scrambled up, pounding on the door. &#34;Nolan!Let me in! You&#39;ll hurt yourself if you stay alone! Please-open up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only silence greeted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Nolan swiped the overpowering scented candle from the table, smashing it to the floor and grinding it out beneath his heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He staggered to the bathroom and twisted the shower knob as far cold as it would go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold water poured over him, barely making a dent in the fire crawling under his skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pressing his back to the freezing tile, he slid down,shoulders shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold water mixed with blood as it ran down his wounded arm, swirling red at the drain. He squeezed his eyes shut, jaw clenched, every muscle fighting the urge that threatened to take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the chaos of his mind, only one truth remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what happened, he would never betray Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not now. Not ever.</p>
