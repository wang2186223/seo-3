                <p>With fervent backing from supporters, Enigma&#39;s sales skyrocketed by ten percent, immediately claiming the title of the season&#39;s most coveted brand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the day of Lainey&#39;s public trial, half a month afterwards, the chatter around the case had not dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp rap from the judge&#39;s gavel signaled the official commencement of proceedings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bailiff guided Lainey to the defendant&#39;s bench with firm hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was clad in a standard prison uniform, her hair hanging dull and yellow, her face exhausted and hollow-her former radiant beauty completely vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she lifted her eyes, Eleanor and Nolan appeared in the gallery, their expressions detached. Jeff and his wife sat nearby, anger etched across their features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred blazed in Lainéy&#39;s gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything pointed to Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Eleanor&#39;s interference, she would have married Nolan and inherited the Benton fortune by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had destroyed her entire future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage consumed Lainey, leaving her trembling and unrestrained. &#34;Eleanor! You wretch! You&#39;ll pay for this!&#34;she shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two bailiffs gripped her firmly; otherwise, she might have lunged forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quiet!&#34; The judge slammed his gavel forcefully, his tone sharp and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lawyer rose, presenting a hefty bundle of documents to the bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Honor, my client accuses Lainey Gilbert of financial corruption, orchestrating Darleen&#39;s murder, and falsifying DNA paternity results. The proof is undeniable. We respectfully request the court&#39;s judgment.&#34; The judge skimmed the papers briefly before addressing the defendant. &#34;Miss Gilbert, the plaintiff has submitted accusations.How do you plead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey seemed disconnected, lost within her own chaotic thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoiding accountability, she launched into a frantic monologue. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything! I didn&#39;t kill anyone!That hateful Darleen! She envied me constantly, blackmailing me after my return to the Benton family. She even hired people to torment me! I had no choice but to end her! I&#39;m the real victim!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, &#34;The DNA test? The Benton family ran it themnselves and accepted the outcome. How does that implicate me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words tumbled out wildly, each sentence a desperate attempt to frame herself as innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her frantic claims, the plaintiff lawyer calmly repositioned his gold-rimmed spectacles and gestured for his assistant to display a video before the court.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It showed the unedited sequence of Lainey mercilessly killing Darleen in the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face twisted with fury, the repeated stabs leaving horrifying marks, each movement brutal and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What depth of hatred could push someone to mutilate a woman repeatedly, even after death?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse, entirely innocent, also suffered under her violent grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audience gasped audibly at the gruesome footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plaintiff lawyer&#39;s voice cut sharply through the courtroom. &#34;Miss Gilbert, do you still claim to be the victim?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then commanded, &#34;Bring in the witness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bailiff soon escorted a trembling man forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear drained his knees, leaving him shaking uncontrollably like a leaf caught in the wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of Lainey, he collapsed entirely, voice quivering as he confessed. &#34;I plead guilty! | admit everything I did! Lainey Gilbert ordered it! She forced me to murder that nurse! She orchestrated everything -it isn&#39;t my responsibility!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic overtook Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This man had worked under Horace previously, tasked with doing her dirty work for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had authorities discovered his involvement as wvell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doomed.</p>
