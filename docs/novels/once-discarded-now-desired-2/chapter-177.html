                <p>Nolan&#39;s private doctor arrived in no time, his black bag in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After checking Norwood thoroughly, he slipped off his stethoscope and gave Nolan a polite nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart, there&#39;s no major cause for alarm. Your grandfather&#39;s blood pressure spiked from too much agitation, which made him faint. I&#39;ve given him something to help him rest and stabilize. With a bit of quiet,he should wake up soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief swept over the room at the diagnosis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone seemed to relax. Norwood would be alright, and that was what mattered most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the doctor walked out, the living room settled back into quiet calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan slowly turned, his eyes carrying an apology as they came to rest on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could get a word out, Eleanor beat him to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should take care of your grandfather. I won&#39;t bother you anymore tonight,&#34; she said softly, already turning toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarm jolted Nolan, and he hurried after her. &#34;Let me at least walk you out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steps halted when Norwood&#39;s voice, faint but cutting, rang out behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you so much as set foot outside after her, you can plan my funeral right now! You&#39;re determined to break my heart, aren&#39;t you? A girl with secrets and schemes, and you think she&#39;s fit for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word dripped with harsh scorn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t flinch. His expression stayed calm and impassive, only deepening Norwood&#39;s frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where Norwood expected a defense or a placating word, Nolan simply met his gaze; voice unwavering. &#34;If anyone&#39;s not good enough here, Grandpa, it&#39;s me.&#34; In his eyes, Eleanor was far beyond what others could ever see. She was Enigma, she was Butterfly, she was the Soul Surgeon. To him, she embodied strength woven with grace, warmth paired with sharp intellect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carried both compassion and shrewdness, resilience clothed in beauty. A woman so extraordinary that even gazing at her felt like a gift. And to call himself her boyfriend was the greatest stroke of luck he could ever know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he knew none of that would sway Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All his grandfather saw was a girl with no family, no title, and a knack for inviting trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood could hardly believe his ears. How could his own grandson claim to be unworthy of a divorced woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s remark did nothing but pour oil on the flames, making the situation burn even hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The effect hit harder than anything Eleanor had said before, and it left Norwood&#39;s face burning red with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid rushed to his side, desperate to calm him before his anger spiraled out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a flicker of emotion, Nolan watched to make sure his grandfather was stable, then turned and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night outside was thick and silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down at the entrance of the villa, Eleanor lingered under the streetlights, feeling unexpectedly adrift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Regal Heights was an affluent neighborhood, set against the mountainside, with a view that was both peaceful and strikingly beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people living here relied on their own cars to get around, while taxi drivers usually avoided coming this far from the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she saw the ride-hailing queue was endless. Any hope of a quick escape vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint trace of regret stirred in Eleanor&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had realized what awaited her, she never would have insisted on handling things alone and leaving by She was utterly lost, her poor sense of direction turning the winding streets of this place into a maze she couldn&#39;t escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she wrapped her coat tighter and started down the main avenue, hoping she would figure out her way eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Headlights suddenly swept over her, cutting through the dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glossy black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop right in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The back window slid down at a measured pace, and there appeared a face of calm elegance. It was Fraser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fell on the slender figure standing beneath the streetlight, and for a moment, surprise flickered in his eyes. &#34;Miss Warren? What brings you out here so late? Let me take you home; it&#39;s not safe to wander around here alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, just as surprised to see him. But then she realized that his presence made sense. The Benton family were practically royalty; it was not surprising that they had an estate in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She checked her phone one last time before offering a faint smile. &#34;Thank you. I&#39;d appreciate the ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan raced out of the villa only to catch the last glimmer of taillights vanishing into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered on the driveway, a rare shadow of fatigue flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After what felt lie an eternity, he turned and made his way toward the villa, the lights stretched his solitary figure across the quiet road.</p>
