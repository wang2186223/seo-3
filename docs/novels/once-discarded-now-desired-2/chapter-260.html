                <p>Hector sent a text message to Nolan the day after.His grandfather had asked him to bring Eleanor to the Stewart Group&#39;s centennial celebration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan couldn&#39;t help but feel unsettled by Norwood&#39;s sudden change of attitude. He couldn&#39;t understand the reason behind it, but it made him wary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the day of the banquet, as Nolan and Eleanor entered the grand hall, a cheerful voice yelled, &#34;Nolan!Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie, her hands lifting her dress, quickly ran over to greet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was overjoyed-at last, her grandfather seemed to welcome Eleanor into the family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She linked arms with Eleanor affectionately.&#34;Oh my goodness! You look gorgeous, Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor returned the smile, her eyes resting briefly on Fannie&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie looked healthier than before; with more care,she might recover fully. &#34;You also look amazing!&#34; Eleanor responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s delight grew at the compliment. She shook Eleanor&#39;s arm playfully, acting a little spoiled. &#34;I&#39;m feeling a lot better now. The Stewart estate is too boring for my liking! I don&#39;t want to stay anymore. Can I live with you? Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t disturb your private time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s face darkened when he heard that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First it was Lillian, then Betsy, and now even his own sister wanted Eleanor&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was intolerable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cleared his throat and asked, &#34;How did you do in your recent exams?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie froze, stomped her foot, and turned to Eleanor for help. &#34;Eleanor, do you see how annoying he is?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Wray watched with a glass of champagne in hand. His expression grew stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was now the head of the Stewart Group, yet when he tried speaking to Fannie earlier, she barely looked his way. But with Nolan and Eleanor, she was full of  joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was her brother, so closeness was natural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why Eleanor? Why did an outsider win her favor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sometimes you need to swallow</p>
                
                
                
                <p>small setbacks for bigger gains.&#34; A calm voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taken aback, Wray turned sharply. &#34;Brodie? What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie tilted his glass and let out a cold laugh. &#34;I&#39;m still a Stewart. Do you think I&#39;d miss an event like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray had no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering his voice,he muttered while glancing toward Nolan,Fannie and Eleanor, &#34;What&#39;s Norwood&#39;s game?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s despised Eleanor from the start. Why bring her in now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Norwood really changed his mind to support Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Brodie was absorbed in thought, the hall&#39;s lights dimmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single spotlight fell upon the stage. The emcee gave a brief welcome and then said,&#34;Please join me in welcoming Mr. Norwood Stewart to the stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood stepped forward with vigor, greeted by a wave of applause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to everyone&#39;s astonishment, he wasn&#39;t alone. A young woman in a flowing white gown stood at his side,her makeup flawless, her bearing graceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none other than Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the microphone from the emcee&#39;s grasp,Norwood swept his eyes across the hall, the weight of authority in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief opening, his voice hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight, at the Stewart Group&#39;s centennial celebration,I have joyous news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing Trudy beside him, he declared, &#34;This is Miss Trudy White. I have chosen her to be Nolan&#39;s fiancée.And let me remind certain people-know your place.Our family will never take in a divorced woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words fell like a hammer. The hall erupted in murmurs of shock.</p>
