                <p>Eleanor inched away from Nolan, but no matter how much space she tried to put between them, his eyes stayed fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every so often, the staff would come in, catch sight of the two of them together, and immediately slip back out with,a knowing grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time it happened, Eleanor wanted to bury herself in the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer it went on, the harder it became to stay calm and focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she couldn&#39;t take it anymore and turned to him with a look of frustration. &#34;With you sitting here,everyone&#39;s giving me that look. Why don&#39;t you head back first? Security&#39;s tight, so I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on Nolan&#39;s face faltered. His lashes lowered slightly, giving him that wounded look that made her feel like she had just kicked a puppy. &#34;You&#39;re sending me away?&#34; he asked quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a long breath, trying to soften her tone. &#34;I&#39;m not chasing you off. It&#39;s just that you being here makes it hard for me to think straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hard for her to think? Ah, he knew that feeling all too well. Whenever she was near, he felt the same way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he thought of this, Nolan&#39;s lips curved into a quiet smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; he agreed without protest, almost too easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor eyed him suspiciously, sensing something off, but chose to let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, her gaze dropped to his hands, and with a hint of worry, she said softly, &#34;Once you&#39;re back change the bandage. If your hands get worse because of me, I&#39;ll feel terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her caring words washed away any lingering sulkiness he felt. His mood lifted instantly, and he teased with a soft grin, &#34;As you wish,baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he addressed her made Eleanor&#39;s cheeks burn red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was getting far too good at this-too smooth,too practiced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day, after Eleanor&#39;s care, Dyer finally woke from his coma and was soon escorted back to the Elepdon Sanatorium on a private plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, too, had to prepare to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of being away from her made him feel heavy inside, and the sadness showed quietly on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor noticed, and her heart softened. She reached for his sleeve, giving it a gentle tug. &#34;Hey,don&#39;t look so miserable. I&#39;ll be back in just a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes dropped to her delicate hand resting against him, and much of the heaviness in his chest lifted. Bending down, he pressed a soft, measured kiss against her forehead. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll wait for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he pulled back, turned, and slipped into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car had barely left the sandy lot when his phone buzzed. As soon as he picked up, Norwood&#39;s harsh voice snapped through the line like a whip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Reckless! You threw away a valuable alliance with the Benton family for a woman? Is this what I taught you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, the Benton family was a lucrative option,but Nolan didn&#39;t see them as his only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And more importantly, he wasn&#39;t about to let anyone weigh the people he cared about on the scales of profit and loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said everything directly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Norwood&#39;s fury only flared hotter. &#34;You&#39;ve completely lost your head over that woman,&#34; he retorted. Nolan, on the other side, had no patience for a fight He brushed it off with a few indifferent words and ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, the screen lit up again, not with another scolding, but with a message from Fannie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, just focus on winning Eleanor over.I&#39;ll handle Grandpa.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan chuckled softly. For the first time that evening,his chest felt lighter. Eleanor saving Fannie earlier really had been worth it.</p>
