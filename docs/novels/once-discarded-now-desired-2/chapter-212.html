                <p>Horace was picturing himself having thechild when a private jet cut through the stormy skies and landed on Zerovia&#39;s runway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and out stepped Nolan in a black trench coat, the kind of man whose presence could silence a crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp gaze swept across the wet, familiar land.&#34;Zerovia,&#34; he muttered under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This place wasn&#39;t foreign to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t come here often, but he knew the lay of the land all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A place full of coruption, backstabbing, and shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if the intel was right, only one organization here would dare touch his girl-the Fist Guild. They had been running wild in Zerovia for years, fattening themselves off the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes darkened as he turned toward Erick, who was shielding him from the rain with an umbrella. His tone left no room for argument. &#34;Get word to the right people. I expect full cooperation. If anyone dares get in the way, we will withdraw from Zerovia altogether.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t an empty threat. Zerovia had been through hell, political mess and economic collapse,and Stewart money was the only thing keeping parts of it afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan knew the weight he carried, and so did everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, he walked out of the airport in long, decisive strides, heading directly for the man in military uniform who stood waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none other than Kaiden Alvarado, commander of Zerovia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The soldiers behind him snapped into salutes the moment Nolan appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart,&#34; Kaiden greeted him firmly before launching into his report. &#34;As soon as I got word,1sent people into the Fist Guild. We&#39;ve got men on the inside now. And according to inside intel, Horace is preparing to take in a mistress, someone with medical skills.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan froze for half a second. Horace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That lowlife dared to set his sights on Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unforgivable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, rage burning through his calm mask.&#34;She&#39;s the one I came for. Don&#39;t move until I say so Just make sure my message gets to her through the informants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, sir!&#34; Kaiden snapped a salute again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Nolan was being escorted through the streets in a convoy of military vehicles, all the way to the most exclusive hotel in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The presidential suite was lavish, yet it felt hollow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stood at the giant window, staring into the night rain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thoughts were all on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she safe? Was she hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of her enduring pain or humiliation clawed at his chest until he could barely breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His negligence had led to her capture. All he could do now was pray she had the strength to hold on until he reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eleanor found herself reluctantly working needles into Horace&#39;s body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The irony wasn&#39;t lost on her. She never thought she would end up treating someone just to fix their bedroom problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If word ever got out, David would probably disown her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace, however, was lying there as if he had struck gold,his face practically glowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sure you can fix me?&#34; he asked eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor curved her lips into something that resembled a smile, though it held no warmth. &#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single phrase was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s chest puffed with pride, his imagination racing ahead. A future where his wife could no longer mock him,where his so-called manhood was restored -he could almost taste the victory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before his fantasy could swell any further,his phone buzzed against the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The caller ID lit up with a name that made his  expression sour instantly. Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snapped up the phone, his joy evaporating,replaced by irritation. He waved at Eleanor like one would shoo away a servant. &#34;Go. You can leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t need to be told twice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smoothly gathered her needles and headed out,but not before catching a glimpse of the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Lainey calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let out a quiet sneer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey calling at this hour most likely meant she wanted to confirm her death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, she would love to know how Horace explained this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching those two snakes turn on each other promised to be entertaining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smirk,Eleanor started exploring the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sense of direction was poor, and she couldn&#39;t afford to get lost in a critical moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she rounded a corner, someone barreled straight into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sighed. Did no one in this place know how to walk without colliding into others?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying herself, she was about to move on when she felt something in her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached in and pulled out a crumpled note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be from an ally?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly slipped into a restroom, shut the door,and unfolded it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note had only a few words, written with deep,bold strokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait for me. Be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught. That handwriting... she would recognize it anywhere. Nolan&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was here. He had come for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of relief spread through her chest, dissolving the weight that had been pressing against her ribcage since her capture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With backup around, she could start planning her move. Lainey thought she had played a clever game,but now the tables were turning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor intended to return the favor, and when she did,it would be a strike Lainey would never forget.</p>
