                <p>Lainey&#39;s composure slipped the moment she witnessed Nolan&#39;s display.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Nolan really chosen to humiliate her in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was one thing to be ignored, but for him to openly show affection for someone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ought to realize she was the only one fit to stand at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as for Eleanor, she was certain that the woman had done it all on purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitch had baited Nolan into making a scene just to put her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that was how they wanted to play, then she had no intention of playing nice! Lainey&#39;s eyes hardened, and she made a subtle signal toward the shadows near the gallery&#39;s edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately, a clear male voice echoed through the hall. &#34;Welcome, distinguished guests.I&#39;m Emmett Mendez, your host for today&#39;s art event. As a token of gratitude for your presence, the organizers have arranged a small game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pausing for a moment, he continued, &#34;Very soon, we&#39;ll randomly pick one attendee to interpret a painting of their choice. Should their explanation impress everyone, the guest will get to bring the artwork home-yes, an original worth millions,absolutely free. Of course, there&#39;s no penalty if your answer misses the mark. This is all for good fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Emmett finished outlining the rules, an uneasy feeling crept over Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fears proved right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spotlight swept the room and landed directly on her. There was no doubt in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was behind this setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced sweetness, Lainey congratulated her.&#34;Eleanor, you&#39;re certainly in luck! Any one of these paintings would be worth a fortune.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath her pleasant tone, she thought, &#34;Let&#39;s see you worm your way out of this one,you bitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dead set on watching Eleanor fall flat on her face tonight, right in front of everyone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Emmett soon approached, extending a hand and gesturing toward a specific canvas. &#34;Miss Warren, this way, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned, and a collective gasp swept the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The painting he indicated was pure abstraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Splashes of wild color and jagged lines dominated the canvas, and anyone could mistake it for a child&#39;s scribble, leaving no clue about the artist&#39;s original  intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To make matters worse, it was the exhibition&#39;s most debated work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Endless theories had been offered, but no explanation was ever confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word was, only the artist knew the real story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what Eleanor said, there was simply no way to land on the correct answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s trap was perfectly set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If ever there was a moment for Enigma to stumble, it was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Nolan broke the tension in an unexpected way.He leaned down, his voice soft as he looked at Eleanor.&#34;Ready to leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he phrased it as if she had a choice, there was no room for negotiation in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was his girl. She didn&#39;t have to play along with their petty games.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nolan&#39;s surprise, Eleanor shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on her lips as she replied with a laid-back, almost teasing rhythm, &#34;That&#39;s all right.I actually know exactly what this painting means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey could barely keep from laughing out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought Eleanor was afool,always desperate to keep up appearances, even if it meant embarrassing herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, this bitch was boasting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the top critics in the field were left scratching their heads, what could an outsider like Eleanor possibly claim to know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Folding her arms and lifting her chin with a superior air, Lainey sneered, &#34;There&#39;s no need to act tough.Just admit you don&#39;t know, and people will understand. But if you pretend otherwise, you&#39;ll just end up being a laughingstock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked up, meeting her gaze with a hint of lazy amusement. &#34;Really? Then maybe you&#39;d like to enlighten us. I&#39;d love to hear your interpretation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question wiped the smugness right off Lainey&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have any ideal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could interpret the painting, she would have been on that stage herself instead of springing this trap on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This bitch actually had the nerve to flip the whole setup on her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unwilling to let herself be cornered, Lainey stiffened and snapped back, &#34;You&#39;re the one who was picked,not me.&#34;</p>
