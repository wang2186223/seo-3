                <p>Eleanor left the tent only after finishing the work of easing Dyer&#39;s pressure points.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, she typed in Lainey&#39;s full name, and sent it to a number she hadn&#39;t used in ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s reports had suggested Zerovia, yet she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Lainey was the one at the heart of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her suspicion proved true, Lainey would have to pay the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That hunch showed its sharpness soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reply arrived almost instantly. &#34;Boss,while studying in Zerovia, Lainey was Horace Boyd&#39;s mistress. He&#39;s the leader of the Fist Guild.&#34; Eleanor sat in silence for a beat, then began typing with sharp intent. &#34;Send me every single detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the files arrived, she copied them all without hesitation. After that, she yanked Jonny off her blacklist and passed the information along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only the opening move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, she would strike at the very heart of what Lainey held dear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Dyer&#39;s influence and the weight of the ancient tombs, the authorities launched a serious inquiry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the following morning, the investigation had been completed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The findings matched almost perfectly with the intelligence Eleanor&#39;s subordinate had provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone involved was immediately taken into custody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Lainey remained untouched, since nothing concrete tied her to the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught Eleanor&#39;s hand, his gaze steady and tender. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t let anyone who wronged you slip away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted his eyes toward Erick and spoke with authority. &#34;Spread the word. My family will cut ties with both the Gilbert and the Todd families, as well as the Benton family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor cut in, &#34;You don&#39;t need to go that far. Cut ties with the Gilberts and the Todds if you must, but keep the Bentons close. The Benton name still holds weight abroad. If an opportunity comes up, backing them could put your firm in a much stronger position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words had barely settled when Nolan tightened his hold. His eyes blazed with fierce devotion.&#34;Nothing matters more to me than you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could react, Lillian charged in with her usual energy. &#34;Eleanor! I&#39;m coming home!&#34;  Eleanor pulled her hand back quíckly, worried her friend might notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of backing off, Lillian let out a playful chuckle. &#34;Come on, you&#39;re a couple. Nobody&#39;s shocked if you get a little close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor&#39;s face darkened, Lillian quickly changed the subject. &#34;Anyway, my mom&#39;s not letting me stay here any longer. She thinks I&#39;ll just get in your way. According to her, you&#39;re out here serving the country, so I should head home. You wouldn&#39;t believe it-she&#39;s basically your biggest fan now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joanne Brooks, her mother, had once served in the military and carried an unshakable sense of loyalty to her country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People like Eleanor, who gave everything for the nation, had always earned her admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t worried about intruding, Joanne probably would have shown up in person just to beg for an autograph. The thought of her softened Eleanor&#39;s expression,and she finally smiled. &#34;Alright then. You and Ryland take care on the way back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan added in a firm tone, &#34;And when you&#39;re home,tell your grandfather I send my regards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Brooks family&#39;s military ties had been key to speeding up the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, international matters dragged on in endless layers of bureaucracy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that, Nolan knew he owed them more than just gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a cheerful nod, then shot them both a sly look. &#34;I&#39;ll stop bothering you now. Enjoy your alone time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before either of them could answer, she bounded off,leaving Eleanor and Nolan alone.</p>
