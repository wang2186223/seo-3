                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t the only one struggling. Ryland also had his own mess to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After running himself ragged digging up information on Jeff, he finally tracked him down, only to learn that Jeff was currently at the Stewart family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland rubbed his temples. Seriously? After being stuck there once already, Jeff still ended up back at that place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just picturing Norwood&#39;s looming presence was enough to make Ryland break out in a cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man was intimidating as hell, and Ryland hated crossing paths with him. But Nolan had given him a job,and bailing wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,swallowing his nerves, Ryland made his way to the Stewart family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he stepped inside, Norwood&#39;s voice hit him like a whip. &#34;Well? Did you track down Eleanor? Is she still alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since Eleanor had shown up at Nolan&#39;s side,disaster had followed close behind. First,she stirred up trouble with those small families,and now there was a kidnapping scandal dragging the Stewart name down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was nothing but trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland could only force a stiff smile. &#34;Mr. Stewart,she&#39;s alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, he felt trapped. On one side, Nolan was chasing love like it mattered more than loyalty. On the other, Norwood was rigid, sharp, and impossible to sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood, clearly uninterested in hearing explanations,waved him away with an impatient flickof his hand.&#34;If that&#39;s what you came to say, then you can leave.I already know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland didn&#39;t argue. Instead, he passed a file to Jeff,who was sitting nearby. &#34;Mr. Benton, Nolan asked me to give this to you. I think it has something to do with a cooperation matter, though I&#39;mn not clear on the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he bowed slightly and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, however, wasn&#39;t really paying attention to the papers. His mind was still replaying the news that Eleanor was alive and safe. He couldn&#39;t explain it, but knowing she was alive brought an odd sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ryland was gone, the living room went quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff glanced at the file in his hands, then at Norwood.Staying any longer suddenly felt awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, giving Norwood a respectful nod. &#34;Mr.Stewart, thank you for your hospitality. Lainey and I should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face remained unreadable as he gestured to the butler.&#34;See them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff nodded once more and headed toward the entrance. He was about to go searching for Lainey in the garden when he spotted her already standing by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convenient. He raised a hand and called to her,&#34;Lainey, let&#39;s get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had been zoning out, and it took her a beat to answer.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind was spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How the hell did that woman manage to crawl back from the fire? And what was in that file Ryland just dropped off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Benton family&#39;s estate, she didn&#39;t rush upstairs. Instead, she stuck around, playing the part of the dutiful daughter, sitting with Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The closer she stayed to him, the faster she could get her hands on those shares. Then her perfect life would finally start.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she was busy daydreaming, Jeff opened the file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gazeas he pulled out a stack of A4papers, along with several photographs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing that jumped out at him was the bold words-Lainey Gilbert,while studying in Zerovia,lived with the local mafia boss...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff froze mid-breath, his chest tightening as he read on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos were worse. There was Lainey,plastered in heavy makeup, cozying up to a tattooed man,laughing like they were lovers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another image showed her gambling recklessly at a casino. And then one where she held a knife, glaring fiercely beside what looked like a severed head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The written report painted a nasty picture about how  she had been some mob boss&#39;s mistress and how she clashed with his legal wife and ended up beaten for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then came the financial trail-a domestic account transferring a full hundred million to a foreign account under the name Horace Boyd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s hands shook, and his thoughts scattered into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could his daughter actually have done something like that?</p>
