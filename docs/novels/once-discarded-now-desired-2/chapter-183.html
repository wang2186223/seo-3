                <p>Fraser had just gotten a call from his assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team he had sent to Zerovia, four people in total, including the local contact, had vanished without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last reports weren&#39;t just troubling-they were catastrophic. All of tem had been taken out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Fraser ran through the news in his mind, weighing his next move, he almost bumped into Lainey at the stairwell entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her was off. Her ambitious expression hadn&#39;t completely faded, and the way she moved suggested she was hiding something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed as he studied her carefully. &#34;Why are you here?&#34; he demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could possibly have brought her to the stairwell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey forced a casual shrug, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead to hide her panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; she said lightly, &#34;the elevator was packed, so l figured I&#39;d take the stairs. Needed a bit of space to think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was calm, but inside, her heart was pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The conversation she had just had with Horace kept replaying in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had Fraser arrived?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he heard even a single word?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One slip, and she would be in serious trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to sound casual, she tilted her head slightly. &#34;Fraser, were you looking for me? Or did you just happen to pass by?&#34; Her words danced between friendliness and careful probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser, however, didn&#39;t answer immediately. He just watched her, silent and unblinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill ran down her spine under that steady stare, and for a moment, she felt herself nearly unravel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Jeff stepped out of the hospital room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a lifeline, Lainey rushed over, clutching his arm, her voice pitched with a whiny edge.&#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff frowned at the tension in the air, glancing first at his pale-faced daughter, then at his serious son.&#34;Fraser, you&#39;re not giving your sister a hard time again, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;NO1&#34;Fraser replied evenly, looking away. &#34;I was just asking a few questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gave a small nod, satisfied with his son&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He patted Lainey&#39;s hand gently, offering a reassuring squeeze. &#34;You two should spend more time talking.It&#39;ll help you understand each other better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right when he turned to leave, something occurred to him, and he added, &#34;Your mother mentioned she hadn&#39;t had a proper spa day in a while, so she went out with Denny. Discharge papers are all set, so unless you&#39;ve got business here, head home quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Jeff didn&#39;t say was that Hilda hadn&#39;t gone for a spa. She had gone to gather hair samples from Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hidden the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the test results came out, any guesses were risky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lainey really was their flesh and blood, those doubts would always hurt her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, Fraser and Lainey were left alone in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser was about to continue testing her when his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked up the call, and his assistant&#39;s anxious voice came through immediately. &#34;Mr. Benton, there&#39;s trouble at the company. A major shipment in Breoqua has been hijacked. They need you to handle it personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser&#39;s brows drew together tightly. &#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call and let his gaze fall on Lainey. Her wide, innocent eyes didn&#39;t fool him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He refused to believe that she had nothing to do with these incidents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was the powerful person supporting her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone have such control?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, though, the company&#39;s stability had to come first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he got to Breoqua, he could use the resources there to investigate thoroughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that decision made, he stepped a little closer to her, his voice low and edged with warning. &#34;I don&#39;t know if any of this involves you, but know this-I will keep an eye on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he turned and strode away, leaving Lainey standing in the corridor.</p>
