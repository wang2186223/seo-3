                <p>About thirty minutes later, the car rolled to a stop at the gates of Elepdon Sanatorium.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The courtyard hadn&#39;t changed; it still carried that quiet charm Eleanor knew so well. But the peace was instantly broken by the sound of bickering. On the patio, Dyer and David were hunched over a chessboard, locked in one of their endless battles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just take your move back! That&#39;s blatant cheating!&#34; Dyer snapped, stabbing a finger at the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David&#39;s face reddened. &#34;Cheating? You&#39;re blind, old man. Maybe if you cleaned your glasses once in a while,you&#39;d see the board properly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but smile helplessly at the sight. Between the two of them, they were close to two hundred years old, yet they bickered with the energy of squabbling schoolboys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat softly as she walked over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, both men stopped mid-argument and looked her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they recognized her, their stern expressions melted into delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, look who it is!&#34; Dyer laughed, rising to his feet and ushering her toward a chair. &#34;What wind blew you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve told us in advance,&#34; David added,puffing up his cheeks. &#34;We could&#39;ve prepared something special for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasted no time. &#34;I actually came because need your advice and your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She explained the current trouble looming over the Stewart Group and how the Perry family was pressing down hard.  The chessboard was forgotten the moment she finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer&#39;s brows knitted together, and he let out a disapproving huff. &#34;So Nolan can&#39;t even hold his own ground? He needs you to carry the burden for him?That boy isn&#39;t fit for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David&#39;s palm came down hard on the table. &#34;Exactly!That boy is nothing but a disappointment. You deserve better. We&#39;ll help you find someone worthy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their words left Eleanor torn between feeling touched and exasperated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew their anger was only born of concern for her, yet she couldn&#39;t let them misjudge Nolan so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tease me like that,&#34; she said softly but firmly.&#34;He&#39;s not weak, and he isn&#39;t careless. He simply doesn&#39;t want me to bear the brunt of this fight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The seriousness in her tone silenced them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two old men exchanged a glance, their playful  banter fading into thoughtful quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Dyer finally muttered, &#34;Tyler&#39;s grown far too bold these last few years. Sitting so high above everyone else has only made him reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David leaned back in his chair, his voice steady.&#34;Politcs and business were never meant to mix.That&#39;s the golden rule.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Eleanor, he continued, &#34;Now telI us, what exactly do you want us to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had already guessed they wouldn&#39;t turn her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at her lips. &#34;The Stewart Group&#39;s so-called tax scandal started with the CFO&#39;s personal dealings. If no one had stirred things up, it never would&#39;ve turned into this storm. What I need is for you to remind Tyler that Elepdon isn&#39;t his family&#39;s playground, and he doesn&#39;t get to throw his weight around here.&#34; Not wanting their frustration with Nolan to deepen,she sweetened her request with a little bait. &#34;David,your paper on nerve repair is still missing crucial clinical data, isn&#39;t it? And Dyer, that royal-era bronze vase you&#39;ve been chasing, the one that slipped away at the last auction. I may know where it ended up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That got them. Their eyes lit with interest at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David was ever the medical fanatic, while Dyer was the collector who lived for rare antiques.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had played straight into their passions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>David coughed into his fist, pretending to hesitate.&#34;Since you&#39;ve put it that way, we&#39;ll see what we can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer didn&#39;t waste words. He pulled out his phone and made a quick call. His tone was calm but left no room for argument. &#34;It&#39;s me. Make sure the Stewart Group&#39;s matter is handled properly. No outside interference.Do it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call with a decisive snap of his fingers  across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could finally breathe easier. The Perry family&#39;s attempt to twist the tax issue to their advantage was already dead in the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up and gave them both a deep bow.&#34;Thank you, Dyer. Thank you, David.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer waved her gratitude aside with mock irritation.&#34;Enough of that. We don&#39;t need thanks. Just remember, if Nolan ever treats you unfairly,we&#39;ll set him straight for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor smiled and nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll keep  that in mind.&#34;</p>
