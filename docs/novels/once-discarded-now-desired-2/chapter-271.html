                <p>Over the following days, Eleanor bounced between the Hope House and Podium Apartments like a restless spirit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they weren&#39;t living together, Nolan felt utterly abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her constant presence, Nolan felt like a forgotten relic gathering dust. That day, he missed Eleanor so much that he headed for her apartment early i the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cradling his coffee cup, he savored each sip with deliberate slowness.When Eleanor emerged ready to leave, he sprang to his feet like a coiled spring.&#34;Eleanor, venturing out somewhere? How about I chauffeur you around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As luck would have it, Eleanor genuinely needed transportation. Myah&#39;s frantic call had just come through about a forgotten notebook lurking at the Hope House&#39;s abandoned site, and she desperately needed Eleanor&#39;s assistance in hunting it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tilted her chin upward, masking her thoughts behind a theatrical pause. &#34;Where did Erick go?&#34; she probed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lie rolled off his tongue like silk. &#34;Shipped him off on urgent business to the neighboring city.He&#39;s trapped there for the next few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The universe had other plans. Footsteps echoed from the entrance at that precise moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick materialized in the doorway, briefcase clutched in his grip, having absorbed every word that had just spilled from Nolan&#39;s mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to freeze around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he showing up at the wrong time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When exactly had Nolan sent him to the neighboring city? Why was he completely in the dark about this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his bewilderment, Erick grasped the situation perfectly. Nolan was desperate for private moments with Eleanor, and retreating gracefully was his only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor crossed her arms with amusement, watching in the unfolding scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment flashed across Nolan&#39;s features before vanishing behind his carefully constructed mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He coughed deliberately and launched daggers at Erick with his gaze. &#34;Why you here? Weren&#39;t you supposed to be on a business trip in the neighboring city?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s entire frame quaked as enlightenment struck,and he bowed his head in swift surrender. &#34;I... I just rushed back to check for any additional orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hand cut through the air dismissively.&#34;Nothing else required.&#34; Relief flooded through Erick as he bolted from the scene likea man escaping wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s attention swiveled back to Eleanor, hope blazing in his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head with resigned amusement before striding toward the exit without ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan trailed after her like a devoted shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sleek black Bentley soon glided away from the apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time had not been kind to the Hope House&#39;s original location. Crimson brick walls now wore thick coats of emerald moss like forgotten armor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together, they forced open the protesting iron gates and ventured into the abandoned grounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing on muscle memory, Eleanor navigated straight to Myah&#39;s old office and located the hefty notebook buried beneath layers of neglect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed away the accumulated dust and caught Nolan&#39;s eye, signaling their mission complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had other plans. As they pivoted toward the exit,they collided with an unexpected gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the front stood Wray, absent from their lives for countless days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A garishly dressed woman clung to his arm while Wray&#39;s chin tilted with arrogant satisfaction. &#34;Baby,I&#39;ll demolish this place and erect a magnificent villa in your honor,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman pressed herself closer, her voice dripping artificial sweetness. &#34;Thank you, Mr.Stewart. That&#39;s so kind of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray basked in her theatrical worship, then his gaze landed on Nolan and Eleanor standing nearby, along with the weathered notebook clutched in Eleanor&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory melted from his features, replaced by cruel amusement. Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What business did he have skulking around this forgotten wasteland?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And why was Eleanor clutching such worthless refuse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a golden opportunity to humiliate him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Malice sparked in Wray&#39;s eyes as he projected his voice with theatrical flair. &#34;Well, well! Nolan! W/hat delightful timing! Has fortune abandoned you so completely that you&#39;ve resorted to scavenging through ruins for scraps? If money troubles are plaguing you, a simple conversation would have sufficed. Despite my modest means, I&#39;d gladly spare some charity for a distant relative!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Eleanor treated him like empty air,continuing their exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Wray&#39;s entourage formed a human barricade across their escape route.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trying to leave?&#34; Wray&#39;s smile turned predatory,&#34;Certainly, but first surrender that stolen stuff.&#34; His contemptuous stare fixed on the logbook in Eleanor&#39;s possession. &#34;This property belongs to Stewart Group, after all. Should inventory go missing,explaining such losses to my superiors would prove...challenging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman draped across Wray&#39;s arm released a tinkling laugh, each note poisoned with mockery. &#34;Oh my, look what the cat dragged in. If it isn&#39;t the illustrious Nolan himself. Who could have predicted you&#39;d escort this lovely lady on a common burglary expedition?&#34;</p>
