                <p>The underground garage was dim and silent as Elora escorted Ady to her car, politely opening the door for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady slipped a check from her bag and handed it over.&#34;Take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were cold, her tone sharper still. &#34;Did anyone see you leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s heart raced as she clutched the check, her fingers trembling with excitement. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Ady.Nolan&#39;s been so busy lately, he&#39;s hardly ever home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady&#39;s gaze narrowed. Her voice cut like a blade.&#34;Remember your task.Fail me,and you know the price.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora shivered. The joy drained from her face,replaced with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t go back to that man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would end up dying at his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady had dragged her out of that nightmare, and she wasn&#39;t ready to lose the little peace she had found. Her voice wavered as she spoke quickly. &#34;Ady, trust me. I won&#39;t disappoint you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, then explained carefully, &#34;I&#39;m taking it slow. Nolan and Eleanor are too close. If I rush, I might ruin everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The frost in Ady&#39;s expression softened, approval flickering in her eyes. &#34;Good. Keep it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door shut, and the sleek black car disappeared into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora stood frozen, gripping the check so tightly her palms broke into a cold sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa in Regal Heights, Elora had barely taken off her shoes when she bumped into Fannie,glowing with excitement after her tutoring session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s cheeks were flushed. &#34;Elora, were you out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora lifted a paper bag with a calm smile. &#34;Nolan&#39;s been buried in work. I thought he could use something to relax, so I picked up lavender candles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if casually, she added, &#34;By the way, do you know what&#39;s keeping him busy? He hasn&#39;t been home much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie leaned closer, lowering her voice like she was  sharing a secret. &#34;He&#39;s proposing to Eleanor in public today! I was just about to tell you. Come on, let&#39;s go see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A proposal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s stomach dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Eleanor were already close, but a public proposal would seal it. If that happened, Ady&#39;s plan would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora had to act quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She masked her panic behind a gentle smile. &#34;I&#39;d love to,but I don&#39;t feel up to it. I&#39;d hate to ruin Nolan&#39;s big moment. You go ahead, though. Take plenty of pictures for me-I want to share the excitement too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were flawless, warm enough to leave no suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie beamed and dashed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor had finished dinner with her mother, and the two strolled through the mall,chatting and laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood was light, but unease tugged at Eleanor&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly tied Elora and Ady together? The evening sky deepened into shades of rose when Eleanor&#39;s phone rang sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face softened at Lillian&#39;s name flashing across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she answered, a dramatic wail spilled through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, where are you? I&#39;m miserable. Let&#39;s go out and go wild tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Lillian playing at now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but sigh in amusement. Lillian hadn&#39;t changed a bit-still loud,still over the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was her best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced at her mother, silently asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda smiled and patted her hand. &#34;Go on. Have fun.I&#39;ll head home myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, Eleanor answered, &#34;Alright, send me your location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pin came through instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma store?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows lifted in surprise. What was Lillian doing there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she understood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business had been booming there, and even the laid-back Lillian had been pitching in, often working late with Besty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was probably too tired to go elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor brushed it off, kissed her mother goodbye,and flagged down a cab at the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cab slipped into traffic, carrying her toward the address.</p>
