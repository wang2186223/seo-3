                <p>Back from the mall, Eleanor slipped easily into the shadows again, keeping her presence quiet and unnoticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Avoidance was her protection-she had no intention of risking a run-in with Nolan, cunning as a fox and twice as persistent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her work required little face-to-face contact anyway,so hiding wasn&#39;t difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But carefully laid plans had a way of unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An embossed card arrived soon after, Nolan&#39;s invitation to a party celebrating Fannie&#39;s recovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instinct was to&#39;decline immediately. Yet after a long pause, she decided to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could he really do if she chose to keep her guard up? Nothing she couldn&#39;t counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides, the Hope House still lingered over her like a debt unpaid. On paper, she owed him,and appearances demanded she show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening crept in faster than she lik&lt;ed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the grand entrance of the Lumina Hotel, Eleanor stepped out of Lillian&#39;s sleek sports car, her composure wrapped tight around her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, chandeliers spilled light over a bustling crowd,where gowns shimmered and conversations swirled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them stood Lainey, dressed to impress, her pale pink off-shoulder gown making her look eager to be noticed as she floated from group to group,fishing for relevance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if pulled by instinct, Lainey&#39;s head turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant her gaze landed on Eleanor, her polished smile cracked, faltered, then hardened into something sharper.Jealousy flared in her eyes like a spark catching flame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that bitch doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had originally intended to drag Jonny along,certain that parading him would cement her importance in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the last moment, Jonny brushed her off,muttering about company work and refusing to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she knew the truth-it wasn&#39;t the workload, it was his discomfort. Without a formal invitation, he didn&#39;t dare show his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Lainey told herself that appearances were everything. In society, status wasn&#39;t given; it was claimed. If one stood tall enough, no one would dare caIl it embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, she smoothed her expression and turned back to the crowd, a polished smile curving across her lips. &#34;Jonny Todd and I are marrying soon.I do hope you&#39;ll all join us for the celebration.&#34; She lingered on Jonny&#39;s surname deliberately, letting it roll off her tongue as if it carried the weight of an empire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the guests gathered by the Stewart family were anything but ordinary. To them, the Todd name was small change. Not a single expression shifted in admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Awkward silence stretched-until Darleen Faulkner,who had brought Lainey in, looped her arm through Lainey&#39;s with easy affection. &#34;Lainey&#39;s gown is a custom commission from Enigma,&#34; she remarked brightly. &#34;The design is Siren Amour. Surely, we could persuade her to give us a preview?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color rose faintly to Lainey&#39;s cheeks, and she pretended to let out a careful laugh. &#34;Darleen, I&#39;m flattered, but I must apologize. I wasn&#39;t completely satisfied with some details, so Enigma is making final adjustments for mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The explanation rippled through the group like a spark. Enigma making revisions for her? That wasn&#39;t something just anyone could demand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even they struggled to secure such attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a privilege reserved for the VIP clients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, the dismissive looks melted away, and the socialites swarmed Lainey as if she were the evening&#39;s centerpiece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, you&#39;re simply dazzling-Elepdon&#39;s true leading lady!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| heard Jonny&#39;s ex-wife didn&#39;t even get a proper wedding when she tied the knot with him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, how could a bumpkin like that ever be compared to Lainey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, Jonny must have lost his mind to marry someone like her in the first place!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey might not have been the most powerful among them, but her ties to Enigma gave her an edge, and in their eyes, that was enough to warrant flattery. Yet Eleanor sat unmoved. Words like that only dirtied the mouths that spoke them, never the one they targeted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, however, had no patience for such nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice sliced through the chatter, dripping with sarcasm. &#34;Isn&#39;t it amusing? Someone crashes an event without so much as an invitation, only to strut around bragging about a gown that went out of fashion years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If memory served, Siren Amour was one of Eleanor&#39;s older designs, a style recycled so many times it had long since lost its shine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hum of chatter inside the ballroom vanished in an instant, the silence heavy enough to press against the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s practiced smile wavered, almost collapsing under the weight of being called out so brazenly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment she stepped into the event, she had been walking on eggshells, terrified someone might realize she hadn&#39;t been invited at all-just smuggled in by Darleen&#39;s side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Lillian had not only dragged that truth into the open but also mocked the Siren Amour she had fought tooth and nail to claim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to win favor among these women now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn that Lillian!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she always standing in her way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Lainey knew better than to lash out. Offending Lillian would be suicide. So she steadied her breath,pasted on a meek expression, and spoke with deliberate humility. &#34;Ms. Brooks, you misunderstand.I would never boast. I simply admire Enigma&#39;s work so deeply that even an older design feels like a treasure to me. And truthfully, Siren Amour is only a spare. Just last week, I placed an order for Enigma&#39;s newest release-though I can&#39;t be sure it will be finished in time for my wedding.&#34; Her lashes dipped, her gaze lowering as if embarrassment had softened her into modesty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Eleanor finally broke her silence, her lips curving into a quiet, amused smile.&#34;Is that so? How curious-I wasn&#39;t aware Enigma offered pre-orders on unreleased gowns.&#34;</p>
