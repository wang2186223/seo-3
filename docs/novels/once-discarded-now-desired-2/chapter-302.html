                <p>Nolan couldn&#39;t turn his back on Elora, not when she was practically family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing the odd feeling that rose within her,Eleanor replied in her usual calm tone, &#34;I&#39;ll come with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no further hesitation, Nolan started the engine and pulled out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept one hand steady on the wheel and used the other to call Erick and shared Elora&#39;s phone number with him. &#34;I need you to trace this number. Do it now,&#34;he ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick responded instantly, not missing a beat.&#34;Understood, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Erick worked quickly. In under a minute,a small red dot started blinking on the dashboard&#39;s GPS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The signal pointed straight to a deserted alley in Westhaven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan made a sharp turn and sped in that direction. When he and Eleanor arrived, they spotted Elora huddled in the shadows, arms wrapped tightly around her knees,her body shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As footsteps echoed toward her, Elora&#39;s head snapped up,eyes wide with mock fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she recognized Nolan, she scrambled upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without thinking, she flung herself into his embrace,her tears spilling freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan! I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to drag you into this.I was just... I was terrified. I kept thinking he&#39;ll come after me again, and I wouldn&#39;t make it out this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s body tensed for a moment, but then he gently rested a hand on her back, offering what comfort he could. &#34;You&#39;re safe now. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hung back a few paces, watching the scene unfold with a quiet sense of distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she felt like an outsider rather than a part of their world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Eleanor&#39;s presence, Elora quickly stepped out of Nolan&#39;s embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed away her tears, offering Eleanor a small, apologetic look. &#34;Forgive me, Eleanor. Whenever1′m frightened, I&#39;ve always turned to Nolan. It&#39;s just how it&#39;s always been since we were little. I hope you don&#39;t misunderstand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle, unreadable smile appeared on Eleanor&#39;s lips.&#34;No worries. I understand,&#34; she replied simply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Nolan, she spoke gently. &#34;It&#39;s late. Let&#39;s get her home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, they pulled up at the villa in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had suspected Elora might end up staying,but watching her disappear into the guest room still left a faint ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere in the house felt noticeably different now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Elora had done nothing wrong, and Eleanor couldn&#39;t find any reason to ask her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the subtle shift in Eleanor&#39;s mood, Nolan pulled her into a soft embrace, his chin resting lightly on her hair. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been so distant lately Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in to press a kiss to the corner of her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for reasons she couldn&#39;t quite name, Eleanor instinctively turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to keep her expression composed, meeting his eyes with practiced calm. &#34;It&#39;s fine.I understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Eleanor&#39;s words were flat and emotionless,Nolan couldn&#39;t shake the sense that something had shifted between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unspoken distance settled between them, subtle yet impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how could that be possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had only stepped in for Elora out of an old friendship. Nothing improper had happened, and Eleanor was always so reasonable. Surely, she wouldn&#39;t be upset over something like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding he was simply reading too much into things,he tried to let the worry go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, the awkward silence between them was broken as Fannie came bounding down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, where&#39;s Elora? Erick told me her ex has been stalking her. I wNas so scared!&#34; Fannie said with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan nodded toward the guest room. &#34;She&#39;s alright I brought her home, and she&#39;s resting now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie let out a relieved breath,then spotted Eleanor  and lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed over, latching onto Eleanor&#39;s hand.&#34;Eleanor! You&#39;re here! I&#39;ve missed you like crazy lately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tried to get a word in, but Fannie was already chattering on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be mad at me or Nolan, okay? This is all because of that horrible ex of Elora&#39;s. You wouldn&#39;t believe how bad it was! Elora came here half-starved,covered in bruises, crying every other minute. Oh! You know something about medicine, right? Could you take a look at Elora for us?&#34;</p>
