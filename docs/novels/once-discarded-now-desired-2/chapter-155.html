                <p>Nolan hesitated for a moment, then let go of Eleanor&#39;s hand. His voice dropped to a whisper meant only for her. &#34;Wait for me. I&#39;ll come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he stepped away, Lillian swooped in like she had been waiting for her chance. Mischief sparkled in her eyes as she folded her arms, her tone laced with mock outrage. &#34;So,when exactly were you planning to tell me you&#39;re getting married? Some best friend you are!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked at her, caught between rolling her eyes and laughing. She reached out and gave Lillian a playful tap on the forehead. &#34;Cut it out. Don&#39;t listen to all that gossip. We&#39;re nowhere near that stage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lighthearted teasing ended the moment a cold,arrogant voice cut through the air. &#34;Stop fooling yourself. The title of Nolan&#39;s wife belongs to me. As for you, Eleanor, you&#39;d better know your place.&#34; Lainey strolled over with calculated grace, a glass of red wine balanced perfectly in her hand. Her eyes were filled with disdain as she looked Eleanor up and down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian bristled immediately. She hated that smug tone of Lainey&#39;s more than anything. &#34;Lainey, last I checked, you&#39;re still married to Jonny. And yet here you are, throwing yourself at someone else&#39;s boyfriend? Honestly, do you even know the meaning of shame?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit hard. For a second, Lainey&#39;s practiced smile faltered, and raw anger flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That useless Jonny!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had wanted to dump him ages ago, but he wouldn&#39;t sign the divorce papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jeff hadn&#39;t promised to step in and handle it for her, she might have taken care of Jonny already. But none of that was going to stop her from making things difficult for Eleanor. And certainly not from claiming Nolan for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, Lainey smoothed her expression back into a smile. &#34;Believe what you want. Just wait and see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sway of her hips, she sauntered off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey wasn&#39;t the type to toss out a few words and retreat so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did this mean the Stewarts and the Bentons had actually struck a deal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian caught the worry clouding Eleanor&#39;s face and immediately tried to reassure her. &#34;Don&#39;t let her nonsense get to you. She&#39;s just bitter, can&#39;t stand seeing you happy. Trust me, I know Nolan, and he&#39;s not the type to dance on strings pulled by his family.The only one pushing this kind of thing is his grandfather-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words died in her throat. The hall had gone silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s attention shifted to the staircase, where Norwood and Jeff were making their way down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were serious, and the way they moved in step told everyone this was no casual appearance.Something important was about to be announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s heart sank like a stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fears proved right a moment later when Norwood&#39;s gravelly voice carried across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tonight, on my birthday, I have a joyful announcement. We and the Bentons will be joining through marriage. Since Nolan and Lainey aren&#39;t ready to rush into a wedding, we&#39;ll begin with an engagement ceremony instead. I hope everyone will celebrate with us on that day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had been some back and forth-Benton wanted a wedding right away, but Norwood insisted on an engagement first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, they agreed to set it for the first of next month.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, the details didn&#39;t matter to the guests. To them, the only thing that mattered was the alliance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some whispered that this alliance wouldn&#39;t just control the city;it could sway the entire nation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood, clearly delighted by the murmurs of approval, decided to drive the point home. His gaze swept the hall before stopping deliberately on Eleanor. &#34;Now that everything is settled, I hope some woman will stop clinging to foolish dreams and spare herself further humiliation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he hadn&#39;t said Eleanor&#39;s name, everyone knew who he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of pity passed through the crowd. &#34;What a shame. She&#39;s such a capable woman, but in the end, the rich never choose talent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s fun company, sure, but thinking she could marry into the Stewarts? That was just a dream.&#34;</p>
