                <p>Horace didn&#39;t give a damn about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pleasure came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scooped Eleanor up effortlessly, carrying her straight to his private lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor clenched her teeth, forcing herself to stay calm,all while subtly taking note of the room&#39;s layout and where people were positioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid her on the bed and leaned toward her eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor swallowed her disgust and instead let a teasing,seductive smile slip onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted a finger, stopping him just short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Horace, don&#39;t be in such a hurry,&#34; she said,her tone playful yet pointed. &#34;There&#39;s always a ceremony first,a symbol of commitment before taking things to the next level. Since I&#39;ve chosen to be yours, it only makes sense that I expect a lifelong partnership.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot him a teasing look. &#34;And... see me like this?Messy, dusty... doesn&#39;t this ruin the fun for you?&#34; Horace froze for a moment, caught in her gaze, his desire spiking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of a lifelong partnership had him grinning like a fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly got up from the bed and pulled his clothes back on. &#34;You&#39;re something else, always keeping me guessing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he left, Eleanor&#39;s smile vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled off the bed and went straight to the window,but it was boarded tight from the outside. There was no way to open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried the door and tugged and twisted the handle,but it was locked too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no choice but to pause and rethink her escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes wandered around the room until they landed on a wall full of photos, with women in revealing poses,dressed to seduce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s past flings, clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned each unfamiliar face until she stopped cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among them was Lainey. One photo showed her cuddled up close to Horace,smiling like nothing was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the next picture? It was pure nightmare material.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey holding a machete, standing over a freshly severed head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder she had kept her history abroad so secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bloodthirsty deeds like that explained everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this wasn&#39;t the time to dwell on Lainey&#39;s past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, she had to focus on escaping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was likely panicking by this point, searching frantically for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But hoping for distant help wouldn&#39;t save her in this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed a plan, and fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that so-called ceremony went ahead, the consequences would be catastrophic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, chaos erupted outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss! Bad news! Bad news!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; someone shouted. &#34;Your wife... something&#39;s wrong with her! She&#39;s seriously ill!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s roar followed immediately. &#34;Get Dr. Watson here immediately! He&#39;s the best doctor in Zerovia! If anything happens to my wife, I&#39;ll make sure you pay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor arched an eyebrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have thought that Horace, the lust-driven maniac, would care this much about his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally got a chance to get out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knocked lightly on the door, catching the attention of the guards outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they came closer, she whispered something to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Horace stormed back to the villa, pacing like a caged tiger beside his wife, who was lying unconscious on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor with him looked terrified. &#34;Boss, I can&#39;t help her. The illness is too severe, and Dr. Watson is out of town. Mrs. Boyd... she might not survive,&#34; he stammered, sinking to his knees. &#34;You should start reparing for the funeral.&#34;</p>
