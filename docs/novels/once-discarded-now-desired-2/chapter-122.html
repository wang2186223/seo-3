                <p>Two days later, Lainey made her way to the Stewart family&#39;s estate for her much-anticipated visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had carefully selected a luxurious set of coffee accessories to offer as a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a crisp white gown, with flawless yet subtle makeup, she moved with the elegance and grace expected of someone raised among high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning Norwood&#39;s favor was her only goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewart family&#39;s butler ushered her into the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood sat on the couch, his demeanor serious, an elegant watch gleaming on his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey presented the elegant coffee set in front of Norwood, then offered a courteous introduction, &#34;Mr.Stewart, I&#39;m Lainey. I was born into the Benton family from Breoqua. I&#39;ve only recently been reunited with my parents. Knowing how much you appreciate coffee, I searched for this set just for you. I hope it suits your taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By emphasizing her distinguished family roots while presenting herself with humility, she hoped to win Norwood&#39;s approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Norwood was not easily won over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could see through her charm; her intentions weren&#39;t as innocent as she pretended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze swept over the coffee set before turning back to her, his words measured and neutral. &#34;That&#39;s very considerate of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease passed through Lainey, but she kept her calm. He was proving more challenging than she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she remained confident in her ability to play  the long game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She settled gracefully into the arm chair nearby lifting a delicate cup and pouring Norwood a fresh serving of coffee. &#34;I&#39;ve admired your accomplishments since I was a child. The Stewart Group has thrived under your leadership, and Nolan&#39;s talent has only helped the company reach even greater heights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most grandparents, she assumed, enjoyed hearing their grandchildren praised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After offering her compliments, Lainey&#39;s voice took on a tone of concern as she continued, &#34;But lately, I can&#39;t help but notice he&#39;s been going against your wishes-all because of a woman with such a questionable past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on an innocent look. &#34;Forgive me for bringing this up, but as a Stewart, Nolan deserves a wife with an impeccable reputation, someone who can strengthen both your legacy and his future. Instead,Miss Warren comes from nothing-she&#39;s an orphan who once married into the Todd family for money and  is still entangled with her ex-husband, even after her divorce. If she marries into the Stewarts, wouldn&#39;t people talk?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sounded heartfelt and genuine on the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood gave her little more than a passing glance as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had spent a lifetime reading people and motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regardless of his feelings about Eleanor, decisions involving the Stewart family belonged to them alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did it become this young woman&#39;s business?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was not related to Benton family by blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood lost all desire for further conversation,choosing instead to lift his coffee and blow across its surface. &#34;Nolan can handle his own affairs. Our family doesn&#39;t need to cling to marriage alliances for security.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message behind his words couldn&#39;t have been clearer-this was not her concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Lainey&#39;s face, leaving her both furious and humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never expected that all her careful planning would fall flat; Norwood remained completely indifferent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really decided to accept Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t let that happen!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s wife was supposed to be her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still determined, Lainey tried to speak up, but Norwood placed his cup down with finality. &#34;I&#39;m tired.Butler, please show her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His refusal came sharp and final, shutting down any chance for further discussion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing left for Lainey but to get up and leave, anger boiling beneath her composed exterior That stubborn old man!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t recognize kindness if it stared him in the face!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she would have her way soon enough. Once she married Nolan, she would make sure Norwood met his maker.</p>
