                <p>Eleanor remained silent, choosing to observe from a quiet corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught sight of her, gave a faint nod, then returned his focus to the figure standing across from him,the half-brother he hadn&#39;t seen in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last memory Nolan had of Brodie stretched back to-their shared childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson had arrived at the Stewart family&#39;s residence with his mistress and Brodie, barely six months younger than Nolan. Norwood had immediately expelled them, declaring they would never set foot in the country again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seventeen years had passed since that fateful day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here Bródie was, standing in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had never truly clashed with Brodie personally, yet simply glimpsing the child of his father&#39;s mistress was enough to darken his mood entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes narrowing, Nolan fixed Brodie with a sharp, icy stare. &#34;Does Grandpa know you returned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie tilted his head and feigned innocence, shrugging lightly. &#34;I&#39;ve heard Grandpa&#39;s health isn&#39;t strong. As his grandson, isn&#39;t visiting expected? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s cruel to phrase it like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While talking, his gaze deliberately flicked toward Eleanor, standing just a few steps away, and he exhaled deeply.&#34;Ah, I understand. Your devotion belongs entirely to Miss Warren now, leaving neither Grandpa nor me any thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her name reached Eleanor&#39;s ears, breaking her quietude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She advanced gracefully, ignoring Brodie entirely. Without hesitation, she moved to Nolan&#39;s side and took his hand.,&#34;Baby, it−1Szgetting late. We should head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his eyes met hers, the tension in Nolan&#39;s jaw eased immediately. He inclined his head, letting Eleanor guide him toward the Bentley parked curbside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut, and the black Bentley vanished swiftly around the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie stayed rooted, a faintly cryptic smile curving his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor,was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fascinating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His attention shifted across the courtroom, where Kurt and Jonny, accompanied by others, hurried along with court officers toward a private visitation corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If memory served,Jonny had once been Eleanor&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman Nolan now protected so fiercely had been married to someone else before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Norwood&#39;s temper flared constantly at the mere thought of their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Lainey, she possessed undeniable strength; wielded correctly, she could become a razor-sharp instrument in his plans, making her eventual rescue worthwhile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that matter could wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie adjusted the brim of his baseball cap, concealing the scheming calculations in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determination hardened his expression-this time, he would reclaim everything rightfully his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the visitation room, only Kurt had arrived; Jonny had yet to enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt&#39;s palms were clammy, and he could not remain seated, his nerves raw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the pain Lainey had caused recently, she remained his daughter, cherished for every moment of her life. The weight of her life sentence pressed heavily against his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauryn, his wife, had fainted at the news andremained hospitalized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chaos had taken over completely. As these thoughts ran through him, the massive iron door swung open. Lainey entered, escorted by two female officers, her distress evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt&#39;s chest tightened painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried to the visitation window, his voice trembling with urgency. &#34;Lainey, sweetie! Don&#39;t worry, Dad&#39;s here.Dad&#39;s right here!&#34;</p>
