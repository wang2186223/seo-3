                <p>Lainey knew people, and how to bend their instincts, better than most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her carefully cultivated persona fit Enigma perfectly, and fans ate it up. They saw her every gesture, every expression, as proof of the legend they adored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some even went so far as to take aim at Lillian, eager to curry favor with Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The donation mess? That&#39;s clearly Lillian stirring trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly! Enigma doesn&#39;t need to fake anything. One dress from her, and it&#39;s worth millions!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A particularly zealous fan dug up photos of Lillian scolding Lainey at a party and shared them online,twisting the story for maximum effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outrage erupted immediately, and before long, Lillian was drowning in criticism across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Brooks Group&#39;s official account didn&#39;t escape the backlash either. Comment after comment poured in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian Brooks is abully. How could she treat Lainey like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey&#39;s too kind. That&#39;s why she keeps getting walked over by people like Lillian!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Down with the Brooks Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Couldn&#39;t agree more!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never trusted Lillian. I once saw her with eight different men in one day. You know exactly what l mean!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Lillian was sitting at the Brooks bar, sipping her drink, completely oblivious to the chaos online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until she went to leave and found herself hemmed in by a crowd that she finally realized what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bullying Lainey? That was absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had only ever spoken the truth!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of anger shot through Lillian. She instantly rolled up her sleeves, ready to make her point, not caring that she was outnumbered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,before she could get a word out, people closed in around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The atmosphere was tense, and a clash seemed likely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing all that, the bar manager freaked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything happened to Lillian on his watch, it would be on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barked orders, sumnmoning the security team. &#34;Move! Get her out of here! Protect Ms. Brooks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards, all retired special forces, immediately sprang into action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, Lillian was escorted to a private lounge on the second floor, safe from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never had Lillian, a Brooks, felt so humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her thoughts immediately turned to Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seething,she cursed.Lainey and hoped her lies would be exposed so the online chaos would finally stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her phone in frustration, she called her brother. &#34;Ryland, I&#39;m cornered at the bar by some wild Lainey fans. Send the bodyguards and get me out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s worry was instant. &#34;Stay put. Don&#39;t move. I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging up, he muttered to Nolan, who was nearby, &#34;Can you believe this? Lillian just said a few words supporting Eleanor, and now she&#39;s surrounded by Lainey&#39;s crazed fans! That woman can&#39;t possibly be Enigma. Honestly, at this point, I really wish Eleanor was...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly stopped, not saying the last word, &#34;Enigma,&#34; because even he thought it was silly. After all, Eleanor had grown up in an orphanage, far from high society. How could she design such luxurious dresses?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if she truly were Enigma, why would she marry a loser like Jonny?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, reading Ryland&#39;s thoughts,remained calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sipped his wine, placed the cup down, and offered a faint smile.&#34;D。on&#39;t underestimate her,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was full of hidden depths, more than most realized.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland chuckled wryly. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t dream of it. I&#39;m just... never mind. I&#39;ll go pick up Lillian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he grabbed his coat from the sofa and hurried out the door.</p>
