                <p>Eleanor had no clue danger was looming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were fixed on the suitcases scattered across the villa&#39;s living room, with confusion written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were those really her things from the apartment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like everything had been relocated.Had she just moved in without anyone telling her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared in silence, her mind running circles before she finally turned toward the obvious culprit beside her. Her voice was calm, but suspicion colored every word. &#34;Nolan, care to explain what this is supposed to mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even flinch. His expression stayed composed, and his voice was as even as ever.&#34;Lainey is being reckless these days. I don&#39;t feel comfortable leaving you to live by yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor almost laughed to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a righteous excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he could only hide the unease flashing in his eyes,she might have almost bought his act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t deny the convenience of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Living here meant easier access to a driver,fewer hassles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened her expression and told him firmly,&#34;I&#39;ll take the third floor for myself. No one&#39;s allowed up there without my permission. That includes you,Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her privacy was non-negotiable. After all, some secrets couldn&#39;t risk being exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the bottom line for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan studied her for a moment, then simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew when to stop pressing.If she were willing to stay, even under her rules, he would take it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the servants had been instructed to sort everything, evening settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan slipped on his suit jacket, leaned in to kiss her,and said casually, &#34;I&#39;ve got a meeting at the office.It may run late, so don&#39;t wait up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, momentarily thrown off. Why did his tone sound so much like a husband speaking to his wife after years of marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought unsettled her, though she didn&#39;t let it show. She only gave a faint nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he left, the quiet pressed in until the maid, Lilah Guerrero, appeared with her usual gentle smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren, dinner is ready. Would you like to have it now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was about to ask Lilah to call Fannie for dinner when her phone suddenly rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number flashing on the screen was unfamiliar. She answered anyway and froze at the sound of Lillian&#39;s slurred, drunken voice. &#34;Fraser, you bastard!How could you leave without saying goodbye? I&#39;ve been looking everywhere for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned. What on earth was going on with Lillian?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could press for answers, another voice came through the line. This one was calm and polite,and clearly he was a bar staff member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, do you know this lady personally? Our bar is closing, but she&#39;s still here and quite drunk. Could you come pick her up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor immediately straightened in her chair. &#34;Send me the location. I&#39;Il be there right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she hung up, she turned to Lilah.&#34;Make sure Fannie eats dinner. I need to step out. Please ask the driver to bring the car around.&#34;Upstairs, she changed her clothes for something more comfortable,then headed straight out. Half an hour later, the car pulled up in front of a place called Nightfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver, noticing the dim lights and rowdy crowd outside, looked uneasy. &#34;Miss Warren, should I accompany you inside?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian was drunk, and she was still a young woman.lf she had taken off her clothes or done something embarrassing in the booth, it would only mnake things worse with a man present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be quick. Wait here.&#34; With that, Eleanor opened the door and strode toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the bartender immediately pointed her toward the back after she explained why she was there. She moved fast, weaving through the noisy crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she was nearing the private booths,the overhead lights went out with a loud buzz, plunging the bar into darkness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart skipped. A power outage? Of all times? She quickened her pace. Lillian hated the dark, and if she was drunk, she would be even more terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was thinking about this, a sharp rush of air came from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instincts screamed at her to dodge, but she was half a beat too slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a blunt force slammed hard into her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain exploded, and her vision blacked out as she collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her last thought was one of pure frustration. She hadn&#39;t even gotten the chance to show what she was capable of.</p>
