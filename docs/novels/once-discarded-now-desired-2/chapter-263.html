                <p>Once they left the banquet hall, Nolan brought Eleanor directly back to the villa in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the sofa, Eleanor reclined comfortably,tilting her face toward the man beside her as he poured water into a glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Playfulness danced in her gaze when she said,&#34;Honestly, I think Ms. White suits you well. Why not consider her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hand stilled, and he set the glass carefully on the coffee table in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he leaned forward, bracing both palms against the sofa&#39;s backrest, enclosing her within his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care how perfect she seems. The only wife I&#39;ve ever chosen is you, Eleanor,&#34; Nolan responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he knew her words were teasing, the seriousness in his eyes never wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a way of provoking him even in moments like this. With so many burdens weighing him down, she still found amusement in jesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And still, he loved her endlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s embrace tightened as he pulled Eleanor close,resting his chin lightly upon her head. &#34;I&#39;ll handle everything,&#34;he promised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tenderness in his voice stirred her, and she pressed her cheek into his warm chest, whispering her soft reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always trusted him unconditionally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, faint commotion sounded beyond the villa,mixed with hurried voices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arms spread wide, Fannie blocked Jeff and Hilda, her expression full of urgency. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Benton,please hear me! What happened today was solely my grandfather&#39;s doing-it has nothing to do with my brother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff ignored her plea, his sharp eyes scanning inside.&#34;Where&#39;s Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exchanging a glance, Nolan and Eleanor rose together and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of Nolan, Fannie flicked her gaze toward  him,urging silently for help in easing the Bentons &#39;anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda rushed forward,clutching Eleanor&#39;s hand, tears brimming instantly. &#34;Eleanor, you must have been upset. Please, come home with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth of a mother&#39;s touch carried undeniable comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt Hilda&#39;s genuine concern, her own heart softening, her voice turning gentler. &#34;I truly appreciate your kindness, but this path is my decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hand free and headed back inside,going up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to face such overwhelming affection, she chose instead to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she watched Eleanor&#39;s figure disappear, Hilda&#39;s disappointment showed clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped closer to Jeff, his tone steady. &#34;I apologize for everything that happened today. I&#39;ll resolve the matter properly, and Eleanor won&#39;t bear any unfair treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s features remained severe, his piercing gaze locked on the young man before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,&#34; he said, &#34;I don&#39;t care how tangled your family  affairs are. If Eleanor ever suffers harm or injustice, I will never let you go unpunished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the study upstairs, Eleanor stood at the window,watching as Jeff and Hilda departed, her emotions in turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she deliberately turned away from that sudden surge of parental love, their sincerity still touched her deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wrestled with these thoughts, Nolan&#39;s firm footsteps drew near behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly smoothed her expression, meeting him with calm composure. &#34;Enigma Group is releasing new projects this quarter, and I&#39;m organizing a charity gala.I&#39;ll be occupied for some time. During this period,I&#39;ll stay at Podium Apartments and won&#39;t return here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan crossed the room and wrapped an arm around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He understood she was giving him space to handle the troubles with Norwood and the White family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Lowering his head, he pressed a kiss onto her forehead. &#34;I&#39;ll assign Erick to serve as your driver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor accepted without resistance, nodding softly.</p>
