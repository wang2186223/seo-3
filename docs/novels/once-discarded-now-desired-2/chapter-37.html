                <p>Had Eleanor been able to hear Jonny&#39;s thoughts, her hand would have flown across his face without a second&#39;s hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such bloated self-importance was enough to make anyone sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Eleanor&#39;s heart was set only on the orphanage, leaving no room for any news about Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope House stood in the heart of the old district, its walls chipped and faded, yet steeped in the kind of memories time could never erase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor knew every creak of its doors, every worn step on the stone path. She pushed her way inside, her arms laden with bags filled with fruit and toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her figure appeared, a wave of excited voices broke out. Small feet pounded against the floor as the children rushed toward her like a tide:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,you came back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, what surprises did you bring us today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we playing puzzles again? You promised last time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched down with a smile, her hand reaching out to ruffle their little heads one by one. &#34;Of course l will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sent them squealing with delight. In an instant, they scattered, eager to dig out the puzzles and games they had prepared for her return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From inside the building, the sound of laughter drew out the old director. Myah Sutton stepped into the doorway,her weathered face softening. &#34;You&#39;ve come home, my dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wrapped around Eleanor like a thread, tugging her straight back into the tender days of her own childhood. For as long as Eleanor could remember, Myah had been a steady presence in her life-the gentlest soul in a world that had often felt unkind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marriage had never been part of Myah&#39;s story, and though her hair had long since turned silver, she chose to remain at Hope House, devoting her days to the children who needed her most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Eleanor&#39;s heart, this selfless woman had long ago taken the place of a mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope House wasn&#39;t just a shelter-it was where her memories began, the only place she truly called home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing the lump rising in her throat, Eleanor forced her lips intoa bright smile as she stepped closer.&#34;Yes, I&#39;ve come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah opened her arms and pulled her into a gentle embrace, her voice tender and steady. &#34;These past three years must have been hard on you. But listen to me-whenever the world feels heavy, you come back here.Hope House will always be your home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the moment Eleanor was little, her maturity had cut deep into Myah&#39;s heart, a child far too sensible for her age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew bits and pieces about Eleanor&#39;s struggles with the Todd family and prayed silently that the girl wouldn&#39;t have to carry more pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s nose stung, her eyes brimming despite her effort to hold steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a trembling smile, she managed to say, &#34;Myah, I&#39;m alright. Truly. You don&#39;t have to worry about me. Tell me-how have you been? The same as always?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had already made up her mind-Myah had carried enough worry for her over the years. She refused to add more weight to those shoulders. Whatever had hurt her belonged to the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Eleanor&#39;s words, Myah chuckled softly, giving her lower back a playful pat. &#34;Just the usual aches of an old woman, nothing that will stop me. Now hurry along-the kitchen made your favorite dish today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting the fruit she carried, Eleanor winked mischievously. &#34;You go ahead. I&#39;ll wash these in the backyard</p>
                
                
                
                <p>first. Otherwise, those little troublemakers will pounce on me before I even step inside.&#34;  Their laughter mingled in the air before they parted ways. Eleanor carried the basket to the backyard, rolled up her sleeves with practiced ease, and set the fruit under the faucet, the water sparkling in the afternoon sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of the corner of her eye, movement caught her attention-a girl, no older than sixteen, crouched near the wall with a much younger child at her side. Both seemed preoccupied, heads bent low over something unseen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older one&#39;s face was unfamiliar. Eleanor was certain she hadn&#39;t seen her during her last visit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she thought, this must be a new arrival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the fruit was rinsed clean, Eleanor walked toward them, her tone gentle.&#34;Hey, it&#39;s too hot out here.Why don&#39;t you two go inside and play? Be careful, or you&#39;ll end up with heatstroke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The older girl lifted her head at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was startlingly pale, drained of color in a way that seemed unnatural.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of unease stirred in Eleanor&#39;s chest-something wasn&#39;t right about that complexion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl wavered unsteadily, her legs trembling as she tried to push herself upright. She gestured weakly toward the scattered sticks and torn scraps of colored paper at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m alright. The kite snapped, and I was just helping my little friend mend it. We&#39;ll have it flying again soon,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried reassurance, but her body betrayed her. Each attempt to steady herself only made the swaying more obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without warning, her knees buckled. She lost her balance.</p>
