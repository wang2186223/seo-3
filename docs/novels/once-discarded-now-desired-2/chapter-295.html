                <p>Back at the Benton family&#39;s villa, Eleanor found herself unable to settle down, her thoughts constantly drifting to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to shake her worry, she made her way to the villa in Regal Heights early the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she arrived, Lilah nearly ran to her,relief written all over her face. &#34;Miss Warren, I&#39;m so relieved you&#39;re here. Mr. Stewart came home before sunrise and locked himself in his third-floor room. He hasn&#39;t spoken or eaten a bite since.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah&#39;s words sent a fresh wave of concern through Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could respond, Lilah continued in a low voice, &#34;Today marks the anniversary of his mother&#39;s death. He&#39;s probably grieving for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had heard bits and pieces about Reyna&#39;s story,but much of it was still a mystery to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curious and wanting to help, she gently asked Lilah to share what really happened. Lilah hesitated, but after a moment, then slowly started explaining everything in full detail. &#34;Years ago,Mr. Stewart&#39;s parents truly loved each other. But eventually, his father became involved with Ady. Ady was the daughter of a servant in the Freeman family and had grown up alongside his mother. Despite their different standings, the two had been as close as sisters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she went on, &#34;When his mother, already expecting Miss Stewart, found out about the affair,she was devastated. Even when his father insisted on a divorce, she refused. So, he moved out with Ady.Heartbroken, his mother gave birth to Miss Stewart,but her health declined rapidly. Not long after, in the depths of her despair, she took her own life by walking into the sea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled up in Lilah&#39;s eyes as she continued,&#34;Right after his mother&#39;s funeral, his father married that woman, Ady. After that, well, you know how everything turned out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor listened in silence, her own eyes brimming with sympathy and heartache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She finally understood that Nolan hadn&#39;t just been cast aside by his father, Colson; he had also carried the unbearable weight of Reyna&#39;s tragic end, and betrayal burned deep into his soul. The thought of how lost and powerless he must have felt back then made her chest ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah dabbed at her tears, her voice pleading softly.&#34;Miss Warren, Mr. Stewart is holding on to so much pain. We all wish we could help, but none of us knows how.Please, could you go to him? Maybe you&#39;ll be able to comfort him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear Lilah&#39;s care for Nolan ran deep. He stood above everyone else, yet seemed forever isolated,unreachable by most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing up the staircase, Eleanor gave a determined nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found Nolan sitting on the floor in her room,clutching a photograph in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman in the picture had kind eyes and an air of gentle grace. It was Reyna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word,Eleanor crossed the room and quietly settled down beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t try to fill the silence, choosing instead to simply be there for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah&#39;s story kept replaying in her mind, over and over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it made sense that Nolan wasn&#39;t truly cold; he  had just buried all his softness and kindness along with his mother&#39;s memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long, heavy silence, Nolan at last took action.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to face her, voice rough and strained. &#34;So,you&#39;ve learned the whole story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor swallowed hard, struggling to keep her emotions in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a gentle whisper, she promised, &#34;From now on,you&#39;re not alone. Your mother would want you to find happiness again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan met her steady, understanding gaze, his stormy expression slowly softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a while, he didn&#39;t speak, and then, in a low voice,said,&#34;I need some time by myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave his hand a comforting pat and rose to her feet.&#34;I&#39;ll make us some lunch. Come down when you&#39;re ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that,Eleanor slipped out of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once outside,she leaned against the wall,letting out a long, shaky breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t help noticing how alike they were. Both  had survived harsh childhoods, and both understood what it meant to feel completely alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet somehow, she had found her family at last,while he still remained caught in a cage of resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After collecting herself, Eleanor made her way downstairs, intending to pick up some groceries from the nearby market.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she stepped onto the first floor, she bumped into Fannie, who had just returned from a tutoring session.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Eleanor, Fannie broke into a bright smile and immediately looped her arm through Eleanor&#39;s. &#34;Are you going out,Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The genuine affection in Fannie&#39;s eyes made Eleanor&#39;s heart warm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. I was just about to get some groceries,&#34; she replied with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s eyes sparkled, hope and excitement mingling in her expression. &#34;Could I tag along? It&#39;s been ages since I went to the supermarket with anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t resist her enthusiasm, giving Fannie&#39;s nose a gentle, playful tap.&#34;Of course you can. Let&#39;s go together.&#34;</p>
