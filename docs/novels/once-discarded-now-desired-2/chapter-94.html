                <p>Thirty minutes later, the auction finally got underway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first lot was a dazzling ten-carat pink diamond ring called The One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment it hit the spotlight, the crowd of socialites gasped in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer cleared his throat, announcing.&#34;Opening bid is $10 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey,legs crossed and confidence radiating, shot Jonny a look</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny caught her meaning but hesitated, lowering his voice. &#34;Lainey,how about picking something else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd Group was in deep financial trouble, and he only had a million in liquid cash to his name</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he could cough up ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jonny wasn&#39;t willing to shell out that kind of money for her, she saw no reason to entertain him further. She shot him a glare, her expression dripping with scorn. &#34;You were the one who insisted I come,and now that I want this ring, you&#39;re hesitating? Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t force you. My real parents will be back soon,and when they are, I&#39;ll have more than enough jewelry like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spoke as if her presence alone was a favor to him,completely unwilling to compromise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny could only clench his jaw in frustration at her attitude. &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll bid on it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could act, a calm, almost bored voice called out from the front row. &#34;$50 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t bother with the paddle as he simply lounged back in his seat, naming a price that stunned the entire room into silence</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifty million?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ring&#39;s value didn&#39;t even reach thirty!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auctioneer barely contained his excitement.&#34;$50million going once, going twice, sold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried to close the bid, anxious that Nolan might suddenly retract his offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That extra twenty million would make his numbers  look fantastic. Of course, he was thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, meanwhile, seemed completely unfazed by the spectacle around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted the ring from an attendant, then slipped it onto Eleanor&#39;s finger himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After studying how it looked on her hand, he gave a small, satisfied smile. &#34;It&#39;s perfect for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was left at a loss, unable to decipher his motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was well aware that she had no real interest in extravagant jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, fifty million could have done so much more,like feeding and clothing the kids at Hope House instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan noticed her quiet discomfort and immediately grasped what she was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in close, he whispered against her ear, &#34;Save it for when I officially propose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor found herself momentarily speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was...unexpectedly daring!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She genuinely didn&#39;t know how to respond. On the other hand, Lainey squirmed with envy watching the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did Eleanor have that caught Nolan&#39;s attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going be acknowledged by the Bentons.Wasn&#39;t she supposed to be above someone like Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to hide her bitterness, she spoke up with a sneer. &#34;Jonny, you really have my sympathy. Eleanor spent three years as your wife, relying on you for everything, and now that she&#39;s landed someone wealthier, she&#39;s tossed you aside without a second thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jab all but called Eleanor a gold digger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone else glanced around nervously, unwilling to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither camp was safe to offend, and a careless comment could mean real trouble later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, an uneasy hush fell over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t bother replying, simply glancing at Lainey for a moment before turning away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her focus was on business tonight; she had no intention of getting dragged into childish taunts. Auction item after item went up, antique paintings,sparkling jewelry, and Eleanor said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Lainey, riding high on compliments from the crowd, snatched up several minor pieces, ignoring Jonny&#39;s livid face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot a barbed remark at Eleanor. &#34;So this is the legendary Enigma? Shows up at an auction and doesn&#39;t place a single bid. What&#39;s the matter? Money a little tight? Should I lend you some?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor acted as though Lainey&#39;s words were nothing but background noise, refusing even to glance her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat quietly, looking bored, like nothing at the auction could hold her interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as the auctioneer brought up the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara, something flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In one smooth, deliberate motion, she raised her hand,elegance and determination radiating from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that simple gesture, she made it clear that no matter the price, she wouldn&#39;t back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one else would dare challenge her. A heavy hush swept over the venue, as if everyone was holding their breath.</p>
