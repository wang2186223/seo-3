                <p>Eleanor rolled her eyes at the whole display.&#34;Seriously? That&#39;s all you&#39;ve got?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a good fighter. Dealing with those security guards was child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just getting ready to take action when she suddenly caught sight of Nolan, who had just stepped out of the hotel lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood leaning against the glass doors, watching her with an amused grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No telling how long he had been there,quietly taking it all in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Nolan realized she had noticed him, he strolled over, slow-clapping as he came closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not bad at all, Miss Warren,&#34; Nolan called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People usually saw Eleanor as soft-spoken and polite, but there was a fierceness in her that no one could push around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trailing after Nolan, Erick stared in open-mouthed shock. He never would have guessed that delicate-looking Eleanor could outmatch men. Poor Nolan-he was going to have his hands full with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Emma&#39;s tough exterior disappeared the instant she spotted Nolan. Her eyes widened, and she swapped anger for vulnerability as she rushed toward him.&#34;Mr.Stewart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get too close, Erick stepped in,holding out an arm. &#34;Miss Todd, you know Mr.Stewart isn&#39;t big on unexpected company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma nearly lost her balance, stumbling awkwardly.She glared, annoyed-of course a powerful man like Nolan would step. in when a woman was in distress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on the waterworks, she faced Nolan and begged, &#34;Mr. Stewart, I have no idea what we did to upset this crazy woman. She just started swinging!You&#39;ve got to help us out.&#34; Nolan&#39;s reputation for keeping to himself was well known. He usually stayed out of petty drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, the way he watched Eleanor out of the corner of his eye made it clear-she had caught his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group of rich men exchanged uneasy looks before bolting upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One clutched his stomach and blurted out,&#34;Something&#39;s wrong with me-l need to get to a hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another waved his phone as if in panic. &#34;Shoot,I forgot my mom told me to come home early. I can&#39;t stay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My girlfriend&#39;s calling me. We&#39;ll catch up some other time!&#34; a third chimed in, bolting away even faster than the ones before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the power he held, Nolan could destroy them without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one in their right mind would have dared to push  their luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Emma, stubborn and thoughtless, continued to stir up trouble. Foolishness clung to her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nolan said nothing, Emma leaned forward,panic rising in her voice. &#34;Mr. Stewart, you can&#39;t let Eleanor deceive you. She&#39;s nothing more than a schemer who trapped my brother with her charms...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were cut short when Nolan spoke at last.&#34;Does the Todd Group no longer require financial support?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma froze, blinking in confusion. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick quickly interjected, &#34;Miss Todd, what Mr.Stewart is saying is that if your family&#39;s company doesn&#39;t want the funds, then we will gladly pull out our investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning hit Emma hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Nolan defending Eleanor again? Just like he had at the previous exhibition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What made that bitch so deserving of Nolan&#39;s support?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although resentment weighed heavily inside her,Emma kept her mouth shut, unwilling to risk a single word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The funding Jonny fought so hard to secure could vanish with one careless move, and Emma knew if she ruined it, the blame would fall squarely on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resentment burned her throat, but she forced a smile and bowed her head. &#34;Please excuse my behavior. I didn&#39;t mean to cause any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Emma slipped out, Nolan approached Eleanor with calm confidence, lowering himself until his face hovered so close that she could feel the warmth of his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nearness made her tense, and she reacted on impulse, trying to shove him back bout to no avail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t look offended. Instead, his eyes gleamed with amusement, and the corners of his lips curved in a sly grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand lifted without warning, brushing over her hair in a gesture that felt far too casual for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are ungrateful,&#34; he murmured with a teasing lilt. &#34;Another rescue, another tally-I&#39;ll keep track for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rooted Eleanor where she stood, the intimacy of his touch catching her completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her mind caught up, Nolan had already turned away, leaving her behind with her fury simmering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if she needed saving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those guards would have scattered the moment she dealt with them, yet he insisted on painting himself as the courageous hero.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened as she swore under her breath that she wouldn&#39;t let herself get tangled up with him again.</p>
