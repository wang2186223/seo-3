                <p>When Nolan and Erick disappeared, Eleanor took her time standing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wandered toward the restaurant entrance, only to find herself face to face with a figure she recognized all too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, of all people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this day get any worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh.Why did it have to be him here of all places?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already spotted Nolan&#39;s car outside, but seeingEleanor now sent a wave of old resentment crashing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, and his voice was harsh. &#34;What&#39;s wrong, Eleanor? Still upset your payout wasn&#39;t big enough? Honestly, you waste no time moving on. Shameless,as always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor roller her eyes, and fixed him with a flat stare. &#34;Jonny, we&#39;re divorced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The message came across loud and clear. It was none of his concern!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, deliberately closing the distance, her gaze cutting past him to settle on Lainey. Then she glanced back with a sly grin. &#34;You know, Jonny, I never imagined you&#39;d do something like that. Tearing down an orphanage? Looks like you&#39;ve lost more than your sense of decency this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion clouded his features. &#34;What are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WVith a laugh that was anything but friendly, Eleanor shook her head and brushed by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she passed, she let her words linger in the air.&#34;Why don&#39;t you ask your girlfriend, Jonny? Maybe she&#39;ll clear things up for you.&#34; Eleanor didn&#39;t wait for a response. She slid into her car, started the engine, and left him in the dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration boiling over, Jonny turned and kicked the flower bed, muttering curses under his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wracked his brain. Since when was an orphanage part of the Usepsall project? Was Eleanor just making things up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Lainey a look, ready to demand answers,but his phone buzzed with an urgent call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Todd, there&#39;s a problem! Stewart Group has just pulled its investment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny nearly dropped his phone. &#34;Come again? What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shaky voice spilled through the phone. &#34;They called our whole leadership incompetent. They&#39;re saying we greenlit tearing down an orphanage.They think we&#39;re heartless and out of our depth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny clenched his phone so hard it nearly snapped in two. Stewart Group&#39;s money was the backbone of the entire Usepsall deal. If they backed out now,every cent spent would be gone for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who in their right mind slipped an orphanage into the demolition list?&#34; Jonny snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard could feel Jonny&#39;s anger even through the line,and fear gripped him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-it was Lainey, Mr. Todd. You once told me that whatever she said came directly from you, so I didn&#39;t have the courage to oppose her!&#34; Allard replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny turned on Lainey in a flash, grabbing the front of her shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With red-rimmed eyes, he glared at her. &#34;I put my trust in you, Lainey, and this is what you do? I get that you have issues with Eleanor, but risking the company&#39;s future-was that worth it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey never imagined that the Stewart Group would respond with such intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She always thought the orphanage was just one  possible site, nothing anyone would lose sleep over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reasoning stayed locked away, though.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pricked the corners of her eyes as she clung to Jonny&#39;s sleeve, her voice a soft whimper. &#34;Jonny,I swear I had no idea the orphanage mattered to Miss Warren. It&#39;s right by the Ravenswood River, and building villas there seemed like smart business. I&#39;m so sorry. If I&#39;ve put you in a tough spot, I&#39;ll step down and take the blame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words faded into a hush. She looked small and broken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of regret crashed over Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Lainey have known about Eleanor&#39;s ties to the place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was sweet,never the scheming type.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe his own stress made him lash out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remorse showed plainly on his face as he drew her into his arms, murmuring an apology. &#34;I lost my head, Lainey. I shouldn&#39;t have taken it out on you. I&#39;m just under a lot of pressure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey let herself be held, peeking up at him with a gentle, forgiving smile. &#34;It&#39;s okay, Jonny. I understand how hard things are for you.&#34;</p>
