                <p>The moment Lainey heard Emma&#39;s word, her face turned livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did Emma think she was, throwing around threats like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s security? Get her out of here right now!&#34;Lainey snapped, her voice echoing across the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few guards rushed over, alarm flickering in their eyes when they realized someone had gotten past them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, they clamped a hand over Emma&#39;s mouth and hauled her away through a side exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s eyes flashed with anger as she tried to  shout, her voice swallowed by the guards&#39; grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one so much as glanced in her direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, she found herself dumped on the pavement outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat for a second, her hair tangled and dress rumpled, but her gaze was fierce and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, you&#39;re not getting away with this,&#34; she vowed silently, squeezing her fists so tightly her knuckles turned white.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Lainey tossed her hair over her shoulder, a scornful look fixed on her face, and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she made it far,she collided with Hilda, who had just stepped through the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, who was that? I could hear you yelling from outside,&#34; Hilda said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of panic shot through Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did she have to show up now, of all times? Had she overheard everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quickly, Lainey pasted on her sweetest smile and intended to link her arm with Hilda&#39;s. &#34;Mom, you&#39;re home! Oh, that was just the property manager coming by to update our records.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a moment, she changed the topic.&#34;Is Dad with you? I didn&#39;t see him come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda let out a grunt and didn&#39;t bother replying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed past Lainey and headed straight into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s arm dropped to her side, and her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a second, she sulked and followed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa soon filled with the sounds of bustling activity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Servants darted back and forth in the kitchen, pots and pans clanging in a chorus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they preparing for a party? No one had told her there would be guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught one of the staff as they hurried by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant paused and answered respectfully, &#34;Mrs.Benton gave orders for a special meal. She said Miss Warren was in a car accident but has finally pulled through. She wants to make sure she recovers well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant the servant finished her explanation,Lainey&#39;s complexion turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth did Eleanor make it out alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should have been dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger kept building inside her, and her eyes turned cold and sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant&#39;s shoulders tensed as he caught her glare, and he shrank back, afraid to say another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda appeared on the staircase in a soft sweater and slacks, catching sight of the tense atmosphere in the foyer. She arched an eyebrow, suspicion clear as she asked, &#34;Why do you look so upset? Shouldn&#39;t you be relieved that Eleanor pulled through?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question jolted Lainey, and she forced hersef to school her features.&#34;Mom, you&#39;ve got it wrong. I just didn&#39;t know what to say for a second. Obviously, it&#39;s great news that Eleanor survived that accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried that Hilda would see through her act, she rushed to add, &#34;We haven&#39;t always gotten along, but that doesn&#39;t mean I want anything bad to happen to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying those words nearly choked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she mumbled a flimsy excuse and darted upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda watched her retreat, the lines on her brow deepening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lainey disappeared from sight, Hilda turned to the servant for the full story of what had just transpired. After she heard every detail, an icy unease crept over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s expression, when she heard about Eleanor&#39;s survival, was chilling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible that Lainey had a hand in the accident?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she thought back to the heated exchange she had overheard at the front door, the suspicion only grew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she kept her composure. Nolan had always approached problems with a level head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already assigned someone to dig into the truth. The facts would surface soon enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until then, she needed to keep Eleanor close and ensure nothing else could happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Hilda made plans of her own, Lainey stormed into her bedroom and slammed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands wouldn&#39;t stop shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of dread and frustration churned in her stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With someone like Emma out there, her secrets were at risk, especially if Nolan applied pressure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting Emma roam free was too dangerous now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have to silence her before things spiraled out of control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that, she would need Horace&#39;s help more than ever.</p>
