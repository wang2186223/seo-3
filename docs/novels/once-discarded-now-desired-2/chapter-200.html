                <p>The moment Jeff entered the house, he nearly collided with Lainey, who came flying down the staircase in a whirlwind of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was pale, her eyes wild, as though some vital piece of her had been stolen away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What on earth happened?&#34; Jeff asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That morning, Lainey had woken early only to find the vast villa deserted except for a handful of servants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her questions revealed the truth-Jeff and Hilda had left at dawn to visit Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold wave of dread had gripped her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no telling what family bonds might lead to,and that made them all the more dangerous. She couldn&#39;t shake the unease that came with how quickly Hilda had grown attached to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If they kept seeing each other, it might stir up feelings best left untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t take that risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What mattered now was locking down the future she had built for herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smartest move would be to marry Nolan without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could do that, then even if the truth came out and people discovered she wasn&#39;t truly a Benton, it wouldn&#39;t matter. She would still have everything she wanted-wealth, status, and a secure place in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With effort, Lainey smothered her fear and curved her lips into a trembling smile that looked more like pain than joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed forward, clutching Jeff&#39;s arm. &#34;Dad, I was terrified being here alone. When you and Mom disappeared this morning, I felt abandoned all over again. Back living with the Gilbert family, I never belonged, never had a place. Now, I just want to stay by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cracked something inside Jeff&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had suffered years of hardship, and it had taken everything to finally bring her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course she felt insecure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blame fell squarely on him-he had failed her as a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his softened resolve, Lainey continued,&#34;Since the Todd family collapsed, I&#39;ve been nothing but a target for gossip. Even though Jonny and I are in the middle of a divorce, people still whisper about me. They even claim-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trailed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s brows knitted sharply, his tone heavy. &#34;Claim what?&#34; Lainey pressed her teeth into her lip, and tears slipped freely down her cheeks. &#34;They&#39;re saying that no matter what, I&#39;ll never measure up to the three Benton boys who grew up in this family. They say/I&#39;II always be the least important, and when the time comes, my share will be the smallest of all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Utter rubbish!&#34; Jeff&#39;s temper erupted, his palm crashing down on the table with a sharp crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fury blinded him to the glimmer of calculation that flashed in Lainey&#39;s eyes, mistaking it for pure hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, she wasn&#39;t just a daughter-she was the long-lost jewel of the entire Benton family. No one had the right to belittle her worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would prove to the world how much she meant to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a voice thick with determination, Jeff promised,&#34;I&#39;ll establish a new branch here at home and place you in charge as president. On top of that, I&#39;ll transfer an extra ten percent of shares from headquarters directly to you. Let&#39;s see who dares to sneer at my daughter then!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heavy front door creaked open at that very moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda stepped inside, arriving just in time to catch every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flickered as she noted the ambition burning behind Lainey&#39;s tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In only a handful of days back in the family, Lainey was already angling for power and shares. Clever,dangerous, and far too bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s stubborn, unyielding face flashed through Hilda&#39;s mind before her eyes returned to Lainey,whose performance reeked of carefully staged desperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own determination became firm and unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a serene smile, Hilda moved closer. &#34;Baby,that&#39;s a wonderful decision. Lainey is bright and capable. She&#39;ll surely thrive as president.&#34; She reached out, resting her hand warmly over Lainey&#39;s. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lainey. You have our full support.&#34;</p>
