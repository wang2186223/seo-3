                <p>Ryland and Lillian didn&#39;t linger; they departed quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor planned to climb to the third floor for rest. As she lifted her foot onto the first step, firm arms slid around her waist from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby servants averted their gaze immediately and hurried away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan rested his cheek against her shoulder. His words hinted at desire, yet his tone carried fatigue.&#34;Eleanor, I want to share a room with you tonight,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt sympathy for him and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Receiving her consent, Nolan lifted her effortlessly carrying her from the first floor straight to the third.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion soon claimed Eleanor, and she drifted off to sleep in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed a soft kiss to her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sleep well, Eleanor,&#34; he whispered, wrapping her completely in his embrace and closing his eyes,finding calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When morning arrived, light spilling through the windows, they woke again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s phone rang incessantly, and surprise struck them when Trudy&#39;s name appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had prepared to meet them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time they reached the café, Trudy was already seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stirred her coffee with deliberate elegance,ignoring them until they were settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she met Nolan&#39;s gaze and laid down her conditions bluntly. &#34;If you beg and consent to marry me obediently, I can have my grandfather intervene.Otherwise, the Stewart Group will collapse for  certain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing,she shifted her sharp gaze to Eleanor,eyes glinting with disdain. &#34;You, however, have two options. Leave Elepdon immediately and vanish from Nolan&#39;s life forever, or kneel and plead. I may allow you to remain his secret mistress. Oh, and post on Twitter admitting publicly that you&#39;re a shameless mistress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her plan was clear: humiliate Eleanor in front of her followers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan ignored Trudy entirely, leaving his refusal unspoken but unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, in contrast, smiled faintly, lifting the glass of lemonade before her and swirling it gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had come curious about Trudy&#39;s schemes, yet this immediate attack had surprised them both.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you really that confident?&#34; Eleanor asked, lips curling with half-amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy leaned back effortlessly, nodding. &#34;Yes, completely. As long as my grandfather stands firm,the IRS will spare nothing from the Stewart Group.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A skeptical eyebrow rose. Eleanor&#39;s tone dripped with irony.&#34;Oh,really? He may hold influence here,but what if the higher authorities intervene?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s reply was sharp, almost defensive.&#34;Impossible! People that high up aren&#39;t reachable by you or the Stewart family!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could elaborate, Tyler&#39;s call cut through.&#34;Sweetheart, I can&#39;t handle this. Someone went over my head straight to the higher-ups. It wasn&#39;t urgent before, but now they&#39;ve spoken, demanding impartial resolution...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of his words were lost to Trudy&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hands shaking, she clutched the phone, staring at Eleanor in disbelief. &#34;How... how did you manage that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor set the lemonade down and rose, looking down at her. &#34;You don&#39;t need to know. Just remember: no one can control every outcome from behind the scenes. Not even your grandfather.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, she left, Nolan walking quietly beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the car, Nolan said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his thoughts, Eleanor reached out and rested her hand on his. &#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. You would find a way even without my intervention. I just wanted to do this for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning his head, Nolan met her clear gaze. The shadows in his heart lifted, replaced by warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Eleanor be so perfect? She shone in a way he wanted to protect, hiding her from the eyes of anyone who might desire her.</p>
