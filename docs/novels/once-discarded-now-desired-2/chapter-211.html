                <p>Darlene Boyd, Horace&#39;s wife, wasn&#39;t the type to be swayed by tears or drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace could cry all he wanted, but her sharp, no-nonsense gaze cut right through him. Finally, her eyes landed on Eleanor. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could he say? That Lainey had set this whole thing up? Darlene would skin him alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he claimed he had been planning to keep Eleanor as a mistress, Darlene might just erase her on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, the fallout would be brutal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no good excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him flounder, Eleanor smoothly stepped in.&#34;Mrs. Boyd, it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you,&#34; she said politely. &#34;I&#39;m a doctor. Horace asked me here to treat you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace latched onto her words like a lifeline, nodding so fast that it looked ridiculous. &#34;Yes, yes! Exactly!She&#39;s a doctor. I brought her here for you, my love.Are you feeling better? Any pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene shot him a cutting glance that shut him up instantly, then turned her attention back to Eleanor.After a long, weighing silence, she finally spoke.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even while she had been unconscious, she had known she was close to death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This young woman, whoever she was, had saved her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she was not the type to repay a debt with hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor inclined her head slightly, keeping her tone calm and respectful. &#34;I&#39;m glad I could help. My name is Eleanor Warren. If you ever need me again,just say the word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said it with purpose. If Darlene remembered her name, Horace wouldn&#39;t dare pull anything reckless against her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way the two women were talking made Horace nervous. He quickly cut in, eager to separate them before more damage was done. &#34;Baby, you&#39;ve just woken up. You need to rest. Dr. Warren still has surgery to attend,so I&#39;ll see her out.&#34; Darlene, still feeling grateful, didn&#39;t argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Eleanor and Horace were outside,he finally stopped walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His whole demeanor had shifted. The hungry,lecherous gleam was gone,replaced with something closer to respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her seriously, he said, &#34;From now on, I&#39;ll be counting on you to take care of my wife&#39;s health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was his way of extending an olive branch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor raised an eyebrow at him, her lips curving faintly. &#34;Fine,&#34; she replied. &#34;But l&#39;ve got one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace thought she was about to make some outrageous request,but all she said was, &#34;I&#39;d like to go for a walk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being stuck inside left her no chance to learn anything or look for a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace studied her carefully, his eyes dark with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he agreed, what if she bolted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other hand, if he said no, she could easily complain to his wife and let slip a few ugly truths.Darlene finding out? That was a nightmare he couldn&#39;t  afford.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, he gave in. &#34;Fine. But you stay close, and I&#39;m sending someone with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t argue. She had gotten what she wanted.Without another word, she turned and strolled toward the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s eyes followed her, darker than before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a lackey slipped out from the shadows and whispered, &#34;Boss,shnould we still get rid of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before the man could even blink, Horace whirled around and sent him crashing to the ground with a brutal kick. &#34;Scram!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grunt coughed, limping away, and Horace spat after him, seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That damned Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one who had wanted Eleanor dead.What a short-sighted fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t she see the value standing right in front of them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasn&#39;t just any woman-her medical skills were a treasure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her on their side, the organization could grow  even stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Horace thought about it, the more the idea consumed him. His lips curled into a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You there!&#34; he barked after the lackey not far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man hurried back at once, bowing eagerly. &#34;Boss,what do you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Set everything up. I&#39;m going to make her mine,&#34;Horace declared, stroking his chin, with eyes full of greed. &#34;But don&#39;t let my wife get wind of it before it&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lackey&#39;s jaw dropped, but he quickly plastered on a smile and nodded. &#34;I&#39;m on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took several steps but then stopped mid-step and turned back with a strange glint in his eyes. &#34;Boss,when I saw the way she used those needles earlier,it reminded me of someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace narrowed his gaze.&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man swallowed hard before whispering,&#34;The Soul Surgeon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even saying the name sent a chill down his spine.&#34;They say the Soul Surgeon&#39;s skills with needles are godlike and able to drag the dying back from death itself,Pure miracles.&#34; Horace&#39;s eyes flickered with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had heard the rumors too, though only as whispers in the underworld.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor really was that legendary figure..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could save the dying, then surely she could fix other problems too. Problems he didn&#39;t dare speak aloud. Maybe she could help him get the child he desperately wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The greed in his chest swelled, and he crooked his finger for the underling to come closer.</p>
