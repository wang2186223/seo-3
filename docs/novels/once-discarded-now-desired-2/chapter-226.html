                <p>As soon as Nolan stepped through the door, an unfamiliar scent drifted in from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the usual aroma from Lilah&#39;s carefully prepared meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slipping into his slippers, he made his way toward the dining room, curiosity piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,he found Eleanor, who was wearing an apron,was setting down the final dish with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile crept across Nolan&#39;s lips. He hadn&#39;t expected this,a home-cooked dinner from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving quietly, he came up behind her, slipping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I must be the luckiest man alive,&#34; he murmured, voice soft and sincere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stiffened, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently pushing his arms away, Eleanor turned to face him, her expression unreadable. &#34;Let&#39;s eat before it  gets cold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meal unfolded in a heavy silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan ate heartily, savoring every bite, but Eleanor only picked at her food,her mind clearly elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jumble of memories tugged at her, everything Nolan had done for her, every sacrifice, every gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gratitude and something deeper warred inside her,but a shadow of discomfort lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, an unfamiliar and creeping sense of unease lingered just beneath the surface, impossible to shake off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to live as someone who needed shielding.She had both the strength and the right to stand by his side, ready to whatever life threw their way,side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All at once, she set down her fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan paused,halfway to reaching for another helping,and glanced up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me about the shares, Nolan.&#34; Her gaze locked on his,steady and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his utensils down with measured calm, his face giving nothing away. But in his eyes, a flash of understanding stirred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,Lillian,always too quick to talk, had let the truth slip out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Nolan rose and walked around the table,pulling her gently into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan drew her close, his tone light as if they were chatting about dinner plans instead of life-altering decisions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandpa&#39;s been feeling nostalgic for the office,so he&#39;s decided to step back in. Honestly, it might work out for the best. I&#39;ll have more time for us,&#34; he replied,brushing off the seriousness with an easy smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor only watched him, her gaze calm and unwavering, not buying the casual act for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unwavering look made Nolan falter, his smile slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always struggled when she was like this, so composed, so clear-eyed, always seeing straight through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, lashes throwing shadows across his cheek, his voice suddenly vulnerable &#34;You know, I handed over the reins at Stewart Group.Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re going to abandon me now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh escaped Eleanor despite herself, though she rolled her eyes at his dramatics. &#34;Cut it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her fingers,his earlier playfulness replaced with genuine warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes met hers, earnest and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything&#39;s under control. Grandpa&#39;s just sulking.Once we&#39;re engaged,he&#39;ll come around. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor swatted his arm, half in jest. &#34;Something this big, and you didn&#39;t think to fill me in? Wle&#39;re supposed to be in this together. Next time, tell me first. I want to be the one you lean on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of affection swept through Nolan, leaving him oddly breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wrapped her up in a steady embrace and nodded,voice low and sure. &#34;You have my word.&#34;</p>
