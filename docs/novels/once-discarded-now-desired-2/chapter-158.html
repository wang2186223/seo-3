                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; Nolan called out, following her without hesitating for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely taken a step when harsh coughing rang out behind him. Norwood&#39;s furious voice cut through the air. &#34;Nolan, go after her, and I&#39;ll disown you,do you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stopped in place, refusing to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hle stood there, rigid and cold as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood caught the hesitation and thought he had finally gotten through to his grandson. With labored breaths, he played his last hand. &#34;This is the last time I&#39;ll ask. Will you be engaged to Lainey or not? Refuse,and I&#39;ll move into a nursing home tomorrow!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside the room, Eleanor heard every word as she left. She paused for a split second, but she didn&#39;t turn around or wait. She simply walked into the elevator and disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The echo of her footsteps left Nolan&#39;s heart aching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to face his grandfather at last, his voice turning icy. &#34;Grandpa, Eleanor is the only person I&#39;ll ever love. That will never change.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no room for argument in the way he spoke. &#34;And if you want to move out and find some peace, I&#39;ll make sure you get the quietest, most comfortable place possible. No one will disturb you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire room went silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the doctors seemed to hold their breath in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone could see this wasn&#39;t obedience; it was Nolan standing his ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re such a disappointment!&#34; Norwood shouted so furious that the edges of his sight turned hazy. He never thought the grandson he raised would turn against himn like this. All for the sake of a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t bother to say anything else. He glanced at the attending doctor, giving him a silent message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor caught on right away. He hurried over to check Norwood&#39;s vitals, speaking softly tocalm him down. &#34;Mr. Stewart, please try to relax. You&#39;ve just regained consciousness, and getting worked up isn&#39;t good for your recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sent a final look in Norwood&#39;s direction,then walked out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s desperate voice trailed after him. &#34;What did I do to deserve a grandson like him?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hilda had arrived at the hospital. As she turned down the hallway, she spotted Eleanor leaving, every step purposeful. Her heart squeezed with recognition; her daughter was right there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She almost moved to go after her, acting on pure instinct. A soft voice pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom, where are you headed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had slipped up beside her, slipping an arm through hers with an affectionate smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda stopped short, holding back the words she wanted to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Lainey and forced a smile. &#34;I left the supplements I got for Norwood in the car. I&#39;ll go and get them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey shook her head. &#34;Forget about the supplements for now. Let&#39;s see Norwood first and show him we care. We can bring the supplements after we&#39;ve checked on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for an answer, she steered Hilda toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no other choice, Hilda followed along, her chest tight with regret over missing another chance to connect with her daughter. When they stepped into Norwood&#39;s room, he was propped up against the pillows, his face still dark and worn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of Lainey, he seemed to relax a little.There was finally a trace of approval in his tired eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least this girl knew to visit first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Hilda a brief nod before focsing on Lainey.&#34;Keep working at it. If you manage to get Nolan to let go of Eleanor, I&#39;ll see to it myself that you two get married.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she heard this, Lainey&#39;s heart soared. To her, this sounded like a promise from Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything she hoped for was finally within reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did her best to hide her excitement and answered with a gentle nod, &#34;I&#39;ll give it everything l have,Norwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood felt even more pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his eyes, Lainey had the composure and charm a  proper lady should possess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was a different story. She always struck him as wild and headstrong, clearly not the type to settle down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Hilda lingered by the side, completely distracted. She couldn&#39;t·stop thinking about Eleanor&#39;s distant figure, the image haunting her thoughts. She barely registered the conversation between Norwood and Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she made up an excuse to step out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding Denny waiting in the hallway, she leaned in close and spoke quietly. &#34;Look into everything Eleanor Warren&#39;s been up to lately. I want details.Keep this between us, and don&#39;t say a word to Jeff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny,who had served the Bentons for years, looked surprised by her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded respectfully. &#34;Understood, Mrs. Benton.&#34;</p>
