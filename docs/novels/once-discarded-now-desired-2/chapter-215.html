                <p>When Horace came to the next morning, his head throbbed mercilessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dragged himself upright, pressing a hand to his aching forehead as he took in the disaster zone around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was wrecked-torn clothes scattered, a glass tipped over, and a plesant scent hung in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His memories of last night were a blur,his mind fuzzy as he tried to recall the details. He rubbed his head,willing the fog to lift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slow grin spread across his face-he had finally had his way with Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s girl had caved to him at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought jolted him awake,making his hangover fade into the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, not bad at all. He would call it a win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But where was Eleanor? Horace glanced around the messy room, puzzled by her absence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have headed off to check in on Darlene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he peered out the window, the sun was already high-it was nearly noon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked to himself. Clever woman, getting on Darlene&#39;s good side before he was even up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In high spirits, Horace got to his feet, slipped on his shoes, and made his wway toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he stepped out, he nearly collided with a stone-faced figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephanie stood waiting-his wife&#39;s most loyal attendant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered a polite bow, her voice sharp and formal.&#34;Sir, Mrs. Boyd wvould like a word with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace nodded quickly, trying to hide his nerves. &#34;Of course, of course, I&#39;ll go right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephanie led the way, her posture rigid and her expression unreadable. The silence on the walk left Horace with a pit growing in his stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a bad feeling about this. His instincts were right. The second he stepped into Darlene&#39;s room, a glass flew at his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dodged on instinct, legs nearly giving out beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling himself together, he forced a shaky smile.&#34;Baby, what&#39;s got you so riled up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,he was terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was no ordinary tantrum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene didn&#39;t bother with words. She fixed him wvith an icy glare, then tossed a phone his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace recognized it instantly-his own phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill crept through him as he stooped to pick it up,his gut twisting with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was still glowing, and at the top was a text message from last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Horace,did you take care of Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His blood ran cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he really left his phone with Darlene last night? Panic set in, his mind racing, sweat breaking out along his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scrambled for words, voice shaky. &#34;Baby, wait,let me explain-this isn&#39;t what it looks like. There&#39;s nothing going on between me and her.I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene interjected, her eyes icy and sharp, &#34;You&#39;re still in touch with that woman? And now you&#39;re scheming to get rid of the one person who saved me?Are you really so eager for a death wish, Horace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s words died in his throat. He dropped to his knees with a heavy thud, the sound ringing through the room. &#34;Baby, please-I know l messed up! I swear,it was just business. That&#39;s all,I-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for once, he couldn&#39;t even spin a convincing lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene didn&#39;t bother to reply. She exchanged a glance with Stephanie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stephanie nodded, walked to the wall, and returned holding a leather whip-her face utterly unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Horace saw the gleaming whip in her hands,panic shot through him. &#34;Baby! I&#39;m begging you-please,not this time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his pleas fell on deaf ears. The whip cut through the air, snapping down hard, and Horace&#39;s cries echoed through the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t dare protest. All he could do was curl up and shield himself, sobbing and writhing on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the shadows behind a pillar, Eleanor observed the spectacle, a sly smirk curving her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spitfire like Darlene would never tolerate any lingering attachment to Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This beating was only a taste of what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real chaos was still ahead.</p>
