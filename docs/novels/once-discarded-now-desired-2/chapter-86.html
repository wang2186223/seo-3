                <p>Yet,Lainey had forgotten that the Internet had a long memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few days of cheering and hype, Enigma&#39;s fans finally cooled off and started piecing the whole mess together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit them that Lainey had played a huge part in their blunder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for her vague, misleading words, they would never have mistaken her for Enigma in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that realization settled in, the fans didn&#39;t even need to sayit aloud. One by one, they slid into private group chats, ready to launch a counterattack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they wanted revenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyone got dirt on Lainey Todd? Let&#39;s dig everything up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t she brag about being a Gilbert? Please. The Gilberts aren&#39;t even relevant in Elepdon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget that. What about her number and address?Who can leak them?&#34; Within thirty minutes, her phone number, home address, and even her usual hangouts, the cafés, malls,and everything in between,were plastered online for anyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Nolan threw fuel on the fire by publicly cutting ties between the Todd and the Gilbert families,making it clear that his loyalty stood firmly with Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other side, Lainey was relaxing with a face mask on, casually watching a drama.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, her phone lit up with a message from an unknown number. &#34;Bitch, thief. Just die already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after that, her phone went haywire, buzzing nonstop as the flood of messages turned into a full-blown onslaught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Lainey shrieked, clutching her ears before hurling the phone against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could people be so vile?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had leaked her personal number as if she were the villain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t her fault they jumped to conclusions!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had never once confirmed she was Enigma. Why should she be punished for their stupidity?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it all! They deserved every curse she could think of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the blow that shook her the hardest was Nolan&#39;s public declaration. By siding with Eleanor, he ended all cooperation with the Gilbert family and divested the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was freaking out. What was she supposed to do now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny would be livid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right on cue, the door opened, and there he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare was sharp enough to cut and heavy enough to crush her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s legs turned to water. She wanted to run to him,to explain, but her body wouldn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she managed was a shaky whisper. &#34;Jonny...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny walked up to her, step by step, and then slapped her hard across the face. &#34;You worthless woman! Why don&#39;t you just die? Plagiarism was bad enough,but now the whole thing&#39;s out of control. Do you see what you&#39;ve done? We and the Gilbert family are finished because of you. Divorce! I want you out!&#34; Divorce?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The word stabbed her like a knife. She couldn&#39;t afford that, not now, not ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down as she clung to his wrist in desperation. &#34;I only did it for you, for this family! Tell me,what did I do so wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jonny&#39;s patience was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another vicious slap, he knocked her to the floor and barked at the maids, &#34;Lock her in her room. She doesn&#39;t step out unless I say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey kicked and fought weakly, but the maids easily dragged her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny tugged at his tie in frustration, regret washing over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he have been so blind? Eleanor. The woman he had dismissed as plain and docile had been Enigma all along-the genius designer the entire industry revered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had chosen Lainey instead, a woman who turned out to be nothing but a shallow pretender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor were still with him, if he hadn&#39;t signed those  divorce papers... he wouldn&#39;t just be her ex-husband -he would be the husband of Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd Group would never have been pushed to the edge of bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wouldn&#39;t be mocked and toyed with by Nolan,who invested one day and pulled out the next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,he couldn&#39;t let it end this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to get Eleanor back, no matter what it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had loved him for three years; those feelings couldn&#39;t have been fake. If he humbled himself, if he begged,surely she would forgive him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With trembling fingers, he pulled up Eleanor&#39;s number and hit dial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But every time, the same cold recording answered,&#34;The number you&#39;ve dialed is no longer in service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After trying again and again, he finally sank onto the sofa,hollow and stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Nolan by her side now, why would she ever look back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no matter what it took, Eleanor had to be his again. If persuasion failed, he wasn&#39;t above taking a darker path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now, he had no move to play.</p>
