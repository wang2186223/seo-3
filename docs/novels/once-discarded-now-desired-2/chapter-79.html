                <p>Moved, Eleanor wanted to thank Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the Stewart Group staff were packing up to leave, the question slipped out before she could stop herself.&#34;Is Nolan around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice had barely faded when a few of the suited employees froze, trading knowing looks with half-suppressed smirks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crept up Eleanor&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had she blurted that out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now they would definitely be making assumptions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to brush it off, she quickly added in acasual tone, &#34;I just thought, since he has done so much for the orphanage, I should thank him in person, maybe invite him to dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff nodded as if they bought what she said, but their smiles told a different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, gossip had already taken root both inside the Stewart Group and all over Elepdon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People were whispering that Nolan, the famously cold and untouchable man, was chasing after Eleanor,the divorcée.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, he was spending money left and right to get her attention, yet she seemed immune to all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with her slip just now, the rumor mill had been handed fresh fuel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team leader leaned in with a sly grin. &#34;Miss Warren, if you want to see Mr. Stewart, you should probably reach out to him yourself. Someone like him isn&#39;t exactly within our reach.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others chimed in with quick agreement, then bowed out politely, leaving Eleanor standing there,feeling rather awkward. Forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d just thank Nolan the next time she bumped into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching out first would only make him read too much into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe he was really tied up with work, because after those little updates on Facebook, he hadn&#39;t shown up around her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor actually found some comfort in that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days later, the big day arrived-the finals of the fashion design competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event was held in the grand banquet hall on the first floor of Enigma&#39;s store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the main entrance, a red carpet stretched out, and the lively crowd filled the place with noise and energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, at the quiet back entrance, a sleek black van pulled in and came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty, already waiting there, stepped forward as the door opened. She bowed slightly and said with crisp respect, &#34;Boss, everything&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor checked her watch and gave a simple nod.&#34;Let&#39;s move.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together they avoided the main building, slipping into the private passage reserved for insiders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right when they rounded the corner near the entrance, Eleanor&#39;s steps faltered. Her eyes landed on Lainey,who had arrived for the competition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed in a flowing pink pleated gown, the soft color making her stand out as she moved through the crowd like a butterfly with a trail of admirers behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze. That dress... it rang a bell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could dwell on it, Besty spoke up again, gently pulling her back to the moment. &#34;Boss, your lounge is upstairs on the second floor, If you need anything, I&#39;ll be right here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Eleanor replied, tearing her gaze away before heading upstairs. The lounge turned out to be exactly her taste-spacious, quiet, with a perfect view overlooking the lively hall below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned against the railing, her eyes scanning the sea of people, and then it clicked. That dress Lainey was wearing-it was one of Eleanor&#39;s own discarded designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had once sketched it, decided it wasn&#39;t good enough, and shoved it between the pages of a notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was where Lainey had fished it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile curled at Eleanor&#39;s lips. Things were about to get interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Down below, Lainey stood in the middle of her admirers, soaking up the praise as if the spotlight belonged only to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the way everyone&#39;s eyes followed her, she felt certain today&#39;s trophy had her name on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After so many unlucky breaks, luck was finally turning in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a voice from the crowd cut through the chatter. &#34;Miss Gilbert, your design looks so much like Enigma&#39;s style!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words spread like wildfire. Faces turned, and eyes narrowed in suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now that people were really looking, it did carry Enigma&#39;s unmistakable touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Lainey copied Enigma&#39;s work?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or was she actually Enigma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd seemed far more excited about the second possibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right!&#34; a woman added. &#34;Miss Gilbert studied fashion overseas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman turned to Lainey. &#34;Miss Gilbert, why don&#39;t you just be honest with us? Are you Enigma?&#34;</p>
