                <p>On the day of the auction, Eleanor was just about to hail a cab when a sleek, understated Bentley rolled up right in front of her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without bothering with formalities, she opened the door and slid into the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, why not take advantage of having a personal driver at her disposal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she got comfortable, Nolan looked at her with sparkling eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt her cheeks warm and quickly turned to the window,pretending to admire the passing scenery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick,watching quietly from the front seat, couldn&#39;t help but let out a sly chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ah, the unmistakable vibe of romance</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had certainly gotten sweeter ever since Nolan had successfully won Eleanor&#39;s heart</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The auction was being held at the Lumina Hotel. The moment Eleanor stepped out of the car, a group of eager socialites surrounded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I&#39;m getting married soon! Can you design my wedding gown?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I&#39;m a fashion design student and have won countless awards. Can I be your apprentice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I&#39;ll pay anything just to have you design my evening dress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,you look absolutely stunningl&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd quickly became overwhelming, but Nolan calmly extended his long arm and pulled Eleanor close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, my girlfriend&#39;s busy,&#34; he said, keeping her protected as he guided her toward the venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one dared cross him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The socialites had no choice but to step aside and disperse,swallowing their frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jonny walked in with Lainey draped over his arm and froze at the sight of Nolan holding Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Eleanor grown even more radiant? That dazzling woman should have been his wife</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all boiled down to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she hadn&#39;t thrown a fit when Lainey returned, he could have had both incredible women by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,things weren&#39;t entirely lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey would soon secure recognition from the Benton family and claim their massive fortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever Lainey acquired would ultimately come under his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With riches comparable to entire kingdoms, he refused to accept that Eleanor wouldn&#39;t come back to him eventually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey noticed his silence and immnediately understood what he was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t bothered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce was final, yet the auction was still a chance she couldn&#39;t miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all,which woman would turn down more jewels?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Lainey hadn&#39;t anticipated was Eleanor showing up at the auction and easily capturing everyone&#39;s attention. She couldn&#39;t stand it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puffing out her chest and lifting her head, she deliberately cleared her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the socialites who were about to leave couldn&#39;t help but return, albeit reluctantly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s Lainey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, don&#39;t forget us when you officially join the Benton family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! The Bentons are so incredibly wealthy When they acknowledge you, don&#39;t forget us little people,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bent over backward, showering her with praise,because they had no choice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, both the Stewarts and the Bentons were untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, who was enjoying their praise, replied with pride, &#34;Of course, I&#39;ll never forget you, my dear friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she purposely looked at Eleanor, only to see her completely ignoring her and walking off with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury flared, and she clenched her fists tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The audacity! Once she was officially acknowledged, Eleanor&#39;s family would effectively become hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when she finally secured the Benton fortune, she would make sure Eleanor understood the full extent of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would relish watching how Eleanor would respond to such a revelation.</p>
