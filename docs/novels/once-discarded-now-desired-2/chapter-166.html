                <p>Eleanor, lost in her thoughts, stumbled a few steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before she could fall, a firm, steady hand reached out and caught her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Nolan. She hadn&#39;t even noticed when he arrived, but now he was standing in front of her,shielding her like a wall. His presence was sharp and intimidating as his cold eyes cut across to Jeff. &#34;Mr.Benton, until the truth is clear, you&#39;d better hold off on throwing accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff opened his mouth to argue, but justthen,the doors of the emergency room burst open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed forward, grabbing the doctor&#39;s hand anxiously. &#34;Doctor, how&#39;s my wife? Is she okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s out of immediate danger...&#34; the doctor began. Eleanor didn&#39;t hear the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gently guided her toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, he ignored the curious stares. His only concern was her, holding her close until they reached his villa in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was still in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s face kept flashing in her mind again and again. The resemblance was so unsettling, it left her rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once home, Nolan led her to the master bedroom upstairs. He tucked her in carefully, his voice low and steady. &#34;Don&#39;t think about anything right now. Leave it to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned down, pressed a soft kiss to her forehead,and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stared blankly at his retreating back, then finally shut her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nolan reached the first floor, his gentle expression had hardened into steel. &#34;Investigate,&#34; he ordered flatly. &#34;Every staff member at Verdant Crest today, every second of surveillance footage, inside and out. I want the full picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick didn&#39;t dare hesitate. &#34;I&#39;m on it, Mr. Stewart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing how fragile Eleanor was, Nolan had her stay in the villa that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his distance, not wanting to disturb her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, he entered the bedroom with a glass of milk in hand, his tone soft with worry. &#34;You&#39;re awake? Wash up first, then drink this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sat up slowly, but her appetite wasn&#39;t there.Meeting his gaze, she said quietly, &#34;I want to go to the hospital to see Mrs.Benton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew she probably shouldn&#39;t, but her emotions were all over the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in her life, she felt like she was losing control, letting her heart lead instead of her mind. No matter how much she tried, she couldn&#39;t shake the memory of the way Hilda had looked at her, with such warmth, with such love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thought maybe she could use her medical skills to help Hilda somehow, to do something, anything,for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan seemed to catch the shift in her expression.He gave her hand a light squeeze. &#34;Alright. Eat something first, then I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded and quietly got out of bed, following his lead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The drive to the hospital was wrapped in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor kept her gaze fixed on the window,watching the world rush by in a blur. But her thoughts wouldn&#39;t stay quiet. &#34;Nolan,&#34; she finally said, her voice low,&#34;do you think is it possible I&#39;m really their daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t wait for his answer. The words poured out on their own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I was little, I used to imagine what my parents looked like. I&#39;d tell myself they must have loved me a lot...they just lost me by accident. Sometimes I even dreamed they&#39;d walk into Hope House one day and take me home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness laced her voice as she continued, &#34;But then one day, Myah told me... both my parents had already passed away. After that, I stopped dreaming about them. I forced myself to be strong, to depend on no one but myself. And then yesterday, I saw Mrs.Benton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in her words was clear. Nolan listened without interrupting, his chest tight with ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her cold hand firmly and spoke softly. &#34;We&#39;ll find out the truth. And no matter what it is, I&#39;ll be right here. I won&#39;t leave you, Eleanor. Not ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on his for a long moment before a faint smile finally broke through. &#34;Okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Regal Heights wasn&#39;t far from the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, their car pulled into the underground garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor drew a slow breath, steeling herself as she stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment the doors slid open and she walked out, her steps faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right in front of her was a face that felt strangely familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the exact same as hers, but the resemblance was uncanny. If he hadn&#39;t been a man,she thought, the similarity between them might have been even stronger</p>
