                <p>A burst of engine noise announced their arrival as Eleanor and Nolan pulled up at the villa in Regal Heights only for a striking purple convertible to zip in and park right in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian barely waited for the car to stop before flinging open the door and dashing out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had rushed over the second she heard the whole story, dragging Ryland along with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she spotted Eleanor, bright-eyed and very much alive, Lillian&#39;s emotions got the better of her. Without a word, she wrapped her arms tightly around her friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! Do you know how worried you made me?&#34; Lillian exclaimned, her voice trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warmth spread through Eleanor as she hugged Lillian back. Softly, she reassured her, &#34;I&#39;m really okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a short distance away, Nolan watched the reunion, his expression tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He waited quietly for a moment before reaching out, almost protectively, to draw Eleanor away from Lillian&#39;s grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still caught up in the moment, Lillian was unaware of the way Nolan glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drew in a steady breath before turning to Eleanor, her expression burning with resentment. &#34;Lainey&#39;s completely out of control. It&#39;s a good thing she&#39;s finally been dealt with, or who knows what else she might&#39;ve done to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mid-sentence, something suddenly clicked in Lillian&#39;s mind. Her eyes widened in disbelief. &#34;But I had no idea you were actuallythe Benton family&#39;s daughter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland looked equally shocked, unable to hide his surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she heard the Benton family name, Eleanor&#39;s mood shifted ever so slightly. That was all it took for Nolan&#39;s patience to wear thin; memories Eleanor would rather forget were surfacing,and he wasted no time in steeringthe Brooks siblings away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If there&#39;s nothing more you need to say, I think it&#39;s time for you both to head home,&#34; Nolan said, his tone leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not waiting for a response, he slipped an arm around Eleanor&#39;s waist and led her toward the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before they went inside, Nolan shot Ryland a meaningful look, silently urging him to get Lillian moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland caught on right away and rushed to stop his sister from saying anything more. &#34;We shouldn&#39;t stick around.Give them a little space; they deserve it. You can always drop by and see Eleanor another time,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian slammed her foot against the ground, her voice rising with frustration. &#34;Eleanor&#39;s my best friend! Are you saying I need to set an appointment just to see her? That&#39;s absurd! I&#39;ve known her way before he ever came along. This isn&#39;t fair at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland took Lillian&#39;s hand, offering a deal she couldn&#39;t ignore. &#34;If you don&#39;t leave with me right now,you&#39;ll lose your allowance next month. But if you come home with me, I&#39;ll tack on an extra million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And surely, money could never convince Lillian to leave her friend behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when she saw Ryland&#39;s determined expression, she finally gave in and slid into the car with a reluctant sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the Brooks siblings drove off, Nolan felt certain no one else would interrupt his time alone with Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as he leaned in to kiss her, Eleanor&#39;s phone blared, cutting through the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s name flashed across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hit the answer button, and immediately, Besty&#39;s enthusiastic voice exploded through the phone,barely audible over the background commotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! I can&#39;t tell you how relieved I am that you&#39;re safe!&#34; Besty exclaimed, nearly shouting. Besty&#39;s nerves had been completely frayed with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Learning Eleanor&#39;s survival washed all that worry away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly stopping to catch her breath, Besty rushed into her next report. &#34;The second word got out that you&#39;re alive, our stores started selling out nonstop. Some products are already gone from the shelves! Could you come over and help us handle the restocking and arrange the new arrivals?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused for a beat, unsure what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instinctively, she glanced over at Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression could only be described as wounded, like a loyal dog watching its owner walk out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after weighing it over, Eleanor decided to say yes. &#34;Alright, I&#39;lI come by soon,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the call ended, she couldn&#39;t resist shooting Nolan a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he honeśtly need to behave as if she were disappearing for good? She was just leaving for a short while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan looked on the verge of losing his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently vowed not to forget the name Besty anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he hated the idea, he went to grab the car keys without protest.</p>
