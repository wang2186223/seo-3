                <p>Kurt and his wife looked at each other, their faces going pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had buried this secret so deep that even Lainey herself had no clue. So how on earth did Denny manage to dig it up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of panic washed over Kurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the more he thought about it, the less surprising it seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Denny&#39;s reach and influence, pulling a secret like this intothe light would have been child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing his lips into something that resembled a smile,Kurt tried to keep his composure. &#34;Mr. Perkins, you certainly keep yourself well-informed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Denny wasn&#39;t finished, and the very next words out of his mouth hit like a thunderclap. &#34;From the way you&#39;re reacting, don&#39;t tell me you actually stole her back then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt&#39;s heart nearly stopped. His hands trembled as he shook his head wildly. &#34;No! Absolutely not! We  adopted her properly, from an orphanage,with all the official paperwork!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lauryn Gilbert, Kurt&#39;s wife, was terrified that the wrong idea might take root and jumped in at once.&#34;Yes,exactly! Westhaven Orphanage.Everything was done by the book, and all the documents are there!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny casually jotted down the name, then let his tone ease into something almost friendly. &#34;No need to be so stiff. We&#39;re just talking. Tell me, after you brought her home, how did she grow up? What kind of student was she? I want the whole picture,every detail. This could determine whether you end up holding this project.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Kurt nor Lauryn dared hold anything back after that They poured out everything they could remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What they didn&#39;t realize was that someone else had heard it all. Lainey had been on her way inside when the words stopped her cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adopted? The identity she had worn like a crown for years, the pride of being the Gilberts&#39; daughter, was nothing but a lie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if things with Jonny had fallen apart, she had thought she could still lean on the Gilbert family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, she wasn&#39;t even theirs by blood. The truth was too much to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She just couldn&#39;t accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like that bitch Eleanor, she was nothing more than an orphan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, it felt as if her entire world had crumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees went weak, and she staggered back several steps before finally steadying herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the conversation ended, and Denny stepped out. His aura of wealth and authority was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart lurched, and she instinctively shrank into the shadows near the doorway</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny didn&#39;t notice her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused in the courtyard, pulling out a wooden rabbit, his eyes burning with a hope he could barely contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to arrange a meeting with Lainey and somehow get hold of a strand of her hair. A DNA test would confirm everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that decision made, he tucked the rabbit back into his pocket and left the Gilbert family&#39;s estate. Only when the sound of his car faded did Lainey slip out from her hiding spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That rabbit... wasn&#39;t it the very one she had smashed to the ground?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,he had picked it up afterward?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the bits she overheard and Denny&#39;s demeanor,a wild, reckless thought began to take root.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that this man was from Eleanor&#39;s real family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he have mistaken her for Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails dug into her palms. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That could never be allowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor must remain an orphan forever</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor not only carried the title of Enigma and was destined to marry into the Stewart family but also turned out to be from a powerful household...then her life would be utterly eclipsed. She would never stand a chance again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea alone filled Lainey with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing herself to calm down, she pulled out her phone, uploaded the photo she had secretly snapped  of Denny, and quickly ran a search.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The results made her pulse race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was Denny Perkins, chief assistant at the Benton Group, one of the most powerful dynasties in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their influence stood shoulder to shoulder with the Stewart Group&#39;s, stretching across continents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s thoughts went wild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she played her cards right, she could slip seamlessly into that kind of fortune</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gilberts would be nothing in comparison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jonny? By then, he would be a discarded</p>
