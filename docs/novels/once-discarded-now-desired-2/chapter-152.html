                <p>Nolan offered no resistance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His posture only grew more rigid as he followed the butler down the hallway and into the basement,getting down on his knees without uttering a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler lingered nearby, hesitating before finally breaking the silence. &#34;Mr. Stewart,why put yourself through this? Your grandfather only wants what&#39;s best for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan kept his eyes fixed ahead, refusing to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a heavy sigh, the butler shook his head and stepped away, worry lining his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such misfortune.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two decades ago, Norwood&#39;s own son had been punished over a woman.  Now,twenty years later, history repeated itself with his grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewarts-forever captives of their own hopeless romantic streak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would their legacy survive another generation like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, the butler&#39;s concerns missed the mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had truly understood Eleanor&#39;s worth,he would have thought Nolan wasn&#39;t good for her, not the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the butler knew was that Nlorwood hadn&#39;t slept in days, his health slipping with every restless night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like another call to the Underground Network was in order-he would need to stock up on those pills, just in case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five hours later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness had settled in. Still stubborn, Nolan lingered in the basement, lips twisting into a wry smile before he finally stood and slipped out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had just wrapped up her work when a knock echoed through her apartment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this hour?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt a flicker of curiosity as she went to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On her doorstep stood Nolan, rain-soaked, his black shirt plastered to his skin and outlining every hard line of muscle across his shoulders and down his narrow waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like a mess, but his eyes were startlingly bright. He fixed her with a plaintive stare. &#34;Baby,you have to let me stay. I got punished by my grandpa-stuck in the basement for hours. And now I&#39;m out on the street, all boecause of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only haIf the truth. He had been sentenced to hours of reflection, yes. But as for being thrown out-Norwood would never have the heart to send him  away, especially if he suspected Nolan might run straight to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Eleanor, of course, saw right through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as she saw Nolan dripping wet and looking so defeated, Eleanor&#39;s resolve melted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh and a roll of her eyes, she stepped aside and tugged him in by the arm, feigning annoyance.&#34;Come on, troublemaker. Get inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fetched a fresh towel and the first-aid kit, then motioned for him to settle on the sofa. Kneeling down, she gently rolled up his pant legs, frowning at the angry swelling on his knees-evidence of hours spent standing in silence, enduring punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pang of sympathy twisted in Eleanor&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands moved even more carefully. &#34;Don&#39;t ever do something like this again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood never hid his disapproval of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if Nolan had just played along-offered a few  placating words, even if they were lies-Norwood never would have punished him like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan must have gone head-to-head with his grandfather, stubborn as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love really did make people foolish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there even a cure for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught the look in her eyes-the worry, the tenderness-and suddenly, every ache in his body felt worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say a word. He just watched her, quietly memorizing the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While things were quiet and calm in Eleanor&#39;s apartment, everything at the Stewart family&#39;s estate was unraveling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood, glancing at the time and realizing Nolan had missed dinner,finally relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A trace of concern slipped into his stern expression as he set his book aside. &#34;Go fetch Nolan,&#34; he  instructed the butler.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler hesitated, shifting from foot to foot.&#34;Mr.Stewart...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s frown deepened. &#34;What is it? Is he still refusing to admit his mistake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking his head, the butler replied even more quietly, &#34;No, sir. He slipped out the moment his five hours were up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heading out so late could only mean one thing-Nolan had gone running straight to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image of his proud grandson lowering himself for that woman set Norwood&#39;s temper ablaze. He slammed his fist down. &#34;Wonderful.Just wonderful!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had given up on Arya, that hopeless woman. But he had a long list of eligible candidates. He would definitely find a woman both worthy of their name and winning Nolan over.</p>
