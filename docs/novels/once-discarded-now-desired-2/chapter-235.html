                <p>The nurse, her mouth clamped shut by a bodyguard&#39;s hand, was so terrified her body gave out completely,and she even wet her pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had she just seen? Lainey, covered in blood, murdering someone right in front of her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey finally turned, as though only now realizing the nurse&#39;s presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was streaked with Darleen&#39;s blood, her lips curled into a twisted grin that made her look less like a woman and more like something dragged straight out of hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse shook violently, tears and mucus streaking her face. Her muffled sobs broke free in desperate gasps as soon as the guard loosened his hold. &#34;Please... don&#39;t kill me. I, I won&#39;t tell anyone... please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey cocked her head, feigning innocence as she smiled sweetly.&#34;Oh,, I don&#39;t mind letting you live. But you&#39;ll have to do a little something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, the nurse&#39;s trembling hands clutched a clipboard as she handed over the forged medical file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked as she spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s... it&#39;s done. Just like you said, it claims Miss Faulkner regained consciousness unstable... and... and that she killed herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey skimmed the page, a satisfied smirk tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped the bood-soaked dagger on the floor, then calmly wiped her hands clean with a wet tissue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small signal to one of her bodyguards, she turned on her heel and walked out as if she had just left a fashion show instead of a slaughterhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguard caught her meaning instantly. The moment the door shut behind Lainey, he drew a knife and, without hesitation, slit the nurse&#39;s throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he wiped the blade and followed after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, neither of them noticed that, hidden behind the curtains, a man had been filming the entire scene on a cellphone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the coast was clear, the man slipped into the room in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What greeted him was a nightmare. Darleen and the nurse sprawled on the floor, both lying in their own blood,already long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly pulled out his phone and made the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Erick, it&#39;s confirmed. Lainey killed Darleen and a nurse. I&#39;ve got the whole thing on video.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, the report traveled through Erick to Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing it, Nolan slowly raised his eyes, a chilling smile tugging at his lips. Lainey&#39;s game was almost over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, footsteps echoed from outside the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray walked in, his eyes dark with resentment, though he forced himself to keep a respectfultone.&#34;Nolan,Norwood wants to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,his chest burned with bitterness. If Eleanor hadn&#39;t suddenly died, if Norwood hadn&#39;t decided to hand Nolan another chance, the general manager&#39;s seat at Stewart Group would have been his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That power, that title...it had been within his grasp, only to be stolen away. How could he not resent Nolan for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan slowly stood up, dusting off his clothes like they had collected dirt. His calm eyes gave nothing away as he prepared to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Wray stepped right into his path. A smug smirk curled his lips, convinced he had the upper hand.&#34;Don&#39;t think you&#39;re untouchable. Eleanor&#39;s gone, and you&#39;ve already let Norwood down. He&#39;ll never really trust you again.&#34; Nolan paused,still as composed as ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside him, Erick wiped at the sweat gathering at his brow. Wray had no idea he was poking a lion with a stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even bother looking at Wray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was light and dismissive, yet it cut deep. &#34;Because Grandpa tossed you a few crumbs of favor,you think you&#39;re important?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, he brushed past without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s face burned red with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared a man who had already fallen out of favor act so high and mighty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, when power was in his hands, he would crush Nolan completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the grand hall, Norwood sat upright in his chair, his expression dark and severe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nolan entered, Norwood raised his eyes and motioned for him to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Bentons&#39; funeral is the day after tomorrow,&#34; Norwood said.&#34;As for your marriage with Lainey, if you don&#39;t wish to attend, then-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan cut in smoothly, &#34;I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s hand halted midair, the coffee cup trembling slightly before he set it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes fixed on Nolan as he tried to read him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was this about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few days ago, Nolan had looked like he would throw his life away for Eleanor. And now, this sudden shift inattitude?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, if he was willing to go through with it, then it was good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, a marriage with the Bentons would only strengthen their position. Still, if he was willing to go through with it, then it was good news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, a marriage with the Bentons would only strengthen their position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood allowed himself a small breath of relief, assuming Nolan had finally seen reason.</p>
