                <p>Danger was quietly closing in, and Hilda had no idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a waitress walked over with a cup of steaming coffee, her smile polite and professional.&#34;Ma&#39;am, the coffee you had earlier has been sitting for a while. It might have gone cold. I&#39;ve brought you a fresh one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was warm, and her reasoning sounded perfectly normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda didn&#39;t think twice. She nodded, accepting the offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waitress set the cup down and placed it in front of her. &#34;Please enjoy,&#34; she said softly before heading back toward the front desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling thirsty, Hilda lifted the cup and took a sip.The taste was fine, so she had a few more. But within moments, her body gave way. Darkness swallowed her, and she collapsed on the table before she could call out for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps and shouts erupted from nearby diners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh my God! What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few rushed to dial 911, while others crowded around in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The commotion grew, drawing the attention of the waitress who had served her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her eyes landed on Hilda, lying motionless on the table, her blood ran cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t what she signed up for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been told the drug would only upset the woman&#39;s stomach, and nothing life-threatening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But looking at her now, so still and pale... what if she had really killed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands shook as panic set in. No money in the world was worth this.She bolted out of the restaurant, disappearing before anyone could question her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, an ambulance pulled up. Inside the restroom, Eleanor heard the noise outside but didn&#39;t think much of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She splashed some cold water on her face,steadying her emotions, and finally stepped back out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she returned to the dining area, the table where Hilda had been sitting was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned and quickly stopped a waiter passing by. &#34;Excuse me, the lady who was just sitting here,where did she go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter was still rattled, patting his chest before answering. &#34;She had some kind of medical emergency. They rushed her off in an ambulance.Honestly, it didn&#39;t look good. Her face was pale,almost bluish. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t wait to hear more. Her stomach dropped as she grabbed her bag and sprinted out of the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the hospital, her nerves were frayed. Spotting a doctor stepping out of the emergency room, she rushed forward. &#34;Hello, please,can you tell me if a lady named Hilda Benton was just brought in? How is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled with urgency, edged with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor, assuming she was family, let out a heavy sigh. &#34;Her condition is very serious. She was brought in too late... you should prepare yourself for the worst.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slowly let go of the doctor&#39;s hand, her mind spinning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda was going to die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had only met once, and before she could find the truth, Hilda might be gone forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of never seeing her again squeezed Eleanor&#39;s chest tight.  No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda couldn&#39;t die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to save her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to do something, anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand was just about to reach for the emergency room door when Jeff and Lainey rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, thinking she was about to cause trouble, yanked her back several steps. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing? Why are you here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor barely managed to steady herself, her lips parting, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, standing close by, covered her mouth in shock. &#34;Did my mom go to see you? Otherwise,why would you be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff froze at her words, then glanced at Eleanor&#39;s pale, stunned face. Suddenly, his eyes filled with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hurt Lainey, and now you&#39;re after my wife too?  How could you be this heartless?&#34; His voice rose as he jabbed a finger at her. &#34;Get out! Don&#39;t stand in the doctors&#39; way. If anything happens to my wife, I swear I&#39;ll make you and the Stewart family pay for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he shoved her toward the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s throat tightened. She opened her mouth,but not a single explanation came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it sting so much? Weren&#39;t they just strangers?</p>
