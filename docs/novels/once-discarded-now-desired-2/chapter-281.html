                <p>The downfall of the Perry and the White families hit Brodie like a bolt out of the blue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, he tried to process the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth had Nolan pulled it off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Perry family was a giant in Elepdon, nearly untouchable. How could they crumble in just one night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the longest time, he assumed Nolan owed everything to Norwood&#39;s favoritism, thinking he could outmaneuver him with a few clever tricks and take over Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, reality finally set in, and he couldn&#39;t even lay a finger on Nolan, while Nolan had the power to destroy him without breaking a sweat. Worse yet, the chief financial officer who took the fall had been his inside man, and most of the stolen money was sitting in his own accounts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of panic crashed over Brodie, and he rushed to book a flight to Zerovia, desperate to get out before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan paid no attention to Brodie&#39;s frantic escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had weeded out the corrupt staff, put out the fires, and steered the company safely through the turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Norwood&#39;s health was steadily improving gave Nolan a quiet sense of relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that afternoon, Nolan drove up to the Stewart family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance, Hector greeted him with a genuine smile. &#34;Welcome home, sir. Your grandfather&#39;s waiting for you in the study.&#34; Nolan stepped into the study, where he found Norwood seated by the windowin a deep leather chair,looking much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Norwood glanced up and saw him, an unusual gentleness flickered in his weary eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, sit down,&#34; Norwood said quietly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan then took a seat across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the usual tension between them. Now,there was only a rare and welcome calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They sat in silence for a moment until Norwood finally broke it, his words deliberate. &#34;I&#39;ve heard everything that happened. Eleanor really came through for you, didn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan just nodded, careful not to exaggerate her role. &#34;She turned everything around. If it weren&#39;t for her, Tyler Perry wouldn&#39;t have been brought down so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood fell silent again, a troubled look shadowing his features. Every misstep with Trudy and Wray could be traced</p>
                
                
                
                <p>back to his own mistakes. He had left the door wide open for disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through it all, Nolan and Eleanor had kept steady,proving they could handle whatever came their way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was on him. His disappointment in Colson had clouded his trust in Nolan, and his bias against Eleanor had twisted his judgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One careless decision had nearly cost the Stewart family everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Norwood looked as if the years had finally caught up with him, his tired eyes fixed on Nolan.&#34;I&#39;m finished interfering in your affairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan froze mid-reach for his coffee, aflash of surprise flickering across his features.11SO1you&#39;re saying you actually approve of Eleanor and me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood didn&#39;t answer him directly. Instead, he turned his attention to Hector, who was standing nearby. &#34;Spread the word. Effective immediately,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Promote your business none of the extended family, Wray included, is allowed in Elepdon unless I say so. They&#39;re to stay out of company business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Norwood slowly pushed himself to his feet, shoulders bent with exhaustion, and shuffled out of the study, his silhouette weighed down by loneliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hopeful expression faded instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of worry then took its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grandpa looked frail now, exhausted by the mistakes of his past, burdened by regret.</p>
