                <p>When Eleanor arrived home, Hilda and Jeff had already returned home from work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she saw her daughter&#39;s deeply troubled expression, Hilda&#39;s maternal instincts kicked in immediately.&#34;Sweetheart, what&#39;s happened? Has Nolan done something to upset you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slowly raised her eyes to meet her mother&#39;s worried gaze and gave a composed shake of her head.&#34;Nothing like that. Just some work stress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda clearly wasn&#39;t convinced, but she knew better than to push when Eleanor put up walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Eleanor disappeared upstairs, Hilda whirled around to face Jeff with obvious concern.&#34;What are we supposed to do about this?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to her daughter&#39;s romantic troubles, she felt completely out of her depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff let out a dismissive grunt. &#34;Simple. We&#39;Il line Eleanor up with someone better. They&#39;re not even officially engaged yet, so there&#39;s plenty of opportunity to change course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda shot him an exasperated look. &#34;Maybe you should focus on getting those sons of ours settled first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve paraded dozens of suitable girls in front of them, and none of them have shown the slightest interest.&#34; Jeff&#39;s expression darkened at the mention of their sons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single one of them excelled professionally, yet their personal lives remained disaster zones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser, who shared Jeff&#39;s ambition and business acumen most closely, still hadn&#39;t brought home a single girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wouldn&#39;t do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would organize another series of carefully arranged introductions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He absolutely refused to accept defeat in finding appropriate daughters-in-law. Right now, though, Eleanor remained the more urgent concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would need to reach out to his network of contacts and start identifying promising candidates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His daughter was an exceptional young woman. Nolan would definitely come to regret losing someone like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely oblivious to her parents&#39; matchmaking schemes, Eleanor shut herself away in her bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperately trying to concentrate, she threw herself into her work projects.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet her thoughts kept drifting back to that heartwarming scene she had witnessed at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, Elora, and Fannie had looked so natural together, like they belonged in each other&#39;s lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did that leave her? Absolutely nowhere in their perfect picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone suddenly buzzed with a message from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at it for what felt like forever before her trembling fingers finally tapped the message open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Elora wants to go camping once she&#39;s released from the hospital. We had to cancel last time.Would you like to come with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Us&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly who was Nolan including in that&#34;∪S&#34;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor found herself staring at the glowing screen, her fingers frozen above the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she managed to type out a response. &#34;I already have commitments that weekend and won&#39;t be able to join. You all should go and have fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she hit send, Eleanor flung her phone onto the bed and forced herself back into her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps the fracture in their relationship had begun the instant Nolan abandoned her to race toward the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the hospital, Nolan read her message with a slight frown creasing his features. She couldn&#39;t come? Was she still holding onto resentment about the proposal that never happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t seem right, though. Petty grudges weren&#39;t her style at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had laid everything out clearly for her, and he had complete faith that she would see reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she simply be drowning in work commitments?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he wrestled with these thoughts, a soft, hesitant voice interrupted from nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, what&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan slipped his phone back into his pocket, his composed mask sliding effortlessly back into place.&#34;Eleanor won&#39;t be able to join us. Looks like it&#39;Il just be the three of us going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s teeth caught her lower lip as she put on a show of genuine disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is my fault, isn&#39;t it? Have I somehow created problems between you two? Maybe I should just stay home by myself.I really don&#39;t mind being alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Giver her current condition, Nolan absolutely refused to abandon her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t overthink it. Eleanor&#39;s likely just buried under deadlines. We&#39;ll plan something for all of us another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie quickly chimed in with enthusiastic support. &#34;Exactly right, Elora! Eleanor runs Enigma Group. She&#39;s constantly juggling a million different projects. Don&#39;t worry yourself sick over this. Just concentrate on recovering your strength.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their combined reassurances seemed to ease Elora&#39;s apparent anxiety. &#34;That&#39;s good then,&#34; she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan studied Elora&#39;s relieved expression, yet something nagging continued to twist in his gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something important was slipping through his fingers, but he couldn&#39;t identify what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told himself it was probably just exhaustion from these last few overwhelming days.</p>
