                <p>As soon as the Faulkners were gone, Erick&#39;s hard look melted into a lopsided grin. &#34;You doing alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips parted just enough for her to breathe out a quiet word of gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Erick quickly waved her off and nodded toward Nolan, standing a little distance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re grateful, you should be thanking Mr.Stewart,&#34; Erick said before ducking out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left standing there, Eleanor said nothing as her gaze landed on Nolan, who made his way over at a relaxed pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped right in front of her, eyes zeroing in on her lips, a sly smile flickering. &#34;I thought you had something to say to me. I&#39;m listening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the mischievous glint in his eyes, Eleanor instantly understood what he was angling for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes flicked upward in exasperation. &#34;Forget it.If you keep pushing, I&#39;ll walk away right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s teasing look vanished in a flash. His attention shifted to the angry red mark on her arm, and his expression turned icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Faulkner family. They would pay dearly for touching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After carefully cleaning her wound and placing a fresh bandage, Nolan pulled out his phone and fired off a message when she didn&#39;t notice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within moments, Erick sent back a quick reply.&#34;Already on it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t usually harsh, but the Faulkners had overstepped. They had no idea what kind of trouble they had brought on themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, the Faulkner family&#39;s underhanded  attempt to trap their competitors with bogus contracts was exposed for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The IRS moved in without delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the afternoon, the entire Faulkner empire was under investigation, and their tax evasion alone was enough to destroy everything they owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once considered one of Elepdon&#39;s most powerful families, the Faulkner family were forced to declare bankruptcy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That the Faulkner family caused trouble for Eleanor and ended up ruined was hardly a coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone quickly connected the dots. Nolan had been the architect behind their downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of panic swept through the city&#39;s social elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wealthy families scrambled to review their own affairs,terrified that one careless relative might have crossed Eleanor or Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the slightest suspicion of a misstep sent family leaders rushing their members to the Stewart family&#39;s estate, eager to beg forgiveness in person and desperate not to be next on the chopping block.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Norwood uncovered the whole truuth,rage overtook him. He smashed his favorite mug in a fit of anger and demanded Nolan&#39;s return that same night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second Nolan walked inside, Norwood swung his cane at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What on earth were you thinking?&#34; Norwood snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his head lowered, Nolan took the blow without protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood, voice trembling with rage, jabbed a finger at Nolan. &#34;Our family name carries weight in Elepdon,but you&#39;d risk making enemies out of every family in town for the sake of one woman? What do you think will become of us then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been right about Eleanor. She had always attracted trouble, and a woman with so many enemies could only drag Nolan down. In his mind, someone like that could never become his grandson&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer Norwood dwelled on it, the more his fury hardened into resolve. His hands shook as he leveled a finger at Nolan, the very man he had raised, and issued a final warning. &#34;End things with that woman now, or I&#39;ll take matters into my own hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes turned steely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew himself upright and locked eyes with Norwood, defiance written in his stare. &#34;Grandpa, I did nothing wrong. The Faulkners were rotten, and their end was coming either way. I only sped up the process. As for my relationship with Eleanor...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, he spoke with unwavering resolve. &#34;I refuse to leave her. If you deny me the chance to marry her, then I&#39;ll stay single for the rest of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the Stewart family, with wealth and legacy on the line, such words carried heavy weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood struggled for air as his cane slammed hard against the floorboards. &#34;That woman&#39;s bewitched you! Someone, take him away! Lock him in the basement. He&#39;s not leaving until he&#39;s done five hours of penance.</p>
