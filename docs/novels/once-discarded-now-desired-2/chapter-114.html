                <p>Nolan had turned into a hopeless romantic ever since Eleanor&#39;s trip to Otrad, his devotion making him blind to everything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For several days straight, aside from the moments he absolutely needed for himself, he hardly left her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if work no longer existed in his world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Eleanor had enough and used business matters as her excuse to escape to the store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she reached the entrance, she came face-to-face with Emma and Vickie, who were stepping out of the neighboring shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma lifted her shopping bags high, her face glowing with excitement. &#34;Mom, Lainey is unbelievable. She only had to speak once, and Jonny handed over his unlimited credit card.&#34; Vickie shot her a sly look, her smile sharp at the edges. &#34;Obviously he did. Lainey&#39;s a Benton by blood. Who else would he suck up to? It&#39;s not like he&#39;d waste his time on some walking jinx dragging this family through the mud.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was ready to agree when her eyes suddenly caught Eleanor standing nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her left Emma momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jonny and Lainey locked in constant arguments lately, she was convinced Eleanor had stirred the trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been waiting for the perfect chance to put Eleanor in her place, and now it seemed the opportunity had delivered itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marching forward with her chin high, Emma sneered,&#34;Listen carefully, Eleanor. Don&#39;t think your little schemes can tear Jonny and Lainey apart. Lainey is Benton blood, and my sister-in-law will always be her. As for you...&#34; Her gaze swept Eleanor up and down with cruel disdain. &#34;You&#39;re nothing more than a girl raised in an orphanage. No matter how talented you think you are, you&#39;ll only ever end up as someone&#39;s toy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but think Emma had completely lost her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why in the world would she leave someone like Nolan for Jonny?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t voice her thoughts. To her, silence and indifference were the sharpest answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing Emma so much as a glance, she simply walked past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s temper boiled over when Eleanor walked away as if she didn&#39;t exist. She lunged forward,hand outstretched to grab Eleanor. &#34;Hold it! Who said you could walk off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The attempt never landed. Instead, a sharp crack rang out as Eleanor&#39;s palm struck her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a second, Emma froze in disbelief. Had this weak, spineless girl really hit her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years of bullying and not once had Eleanor fought back, yet now she dared to raise a hand?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Didn&#39;t she realize she could run to Jonny and make him despise her forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor offered no explanation, no apology. She simply lowered her arm and rolled her wrist,loosening the sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze cut like ice as it slid to Vickie and then back to Emma. &#34;Next time you try that, it won&#39;t stop with a slap.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her warning delivered, Eleanor strode calmly into her store, her composure untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when her silhouette vanished did Emma&#39;s voice return, shrill with outrage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom! She hit me! She has crossed a line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie&#39;s anger already simmered to the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for the people nearby, she might have clawed Eleanor&#39;s face to pieces on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable. That little tramp dares to raise her hand? She needs to be taught a lesson!&#34; Vickie muttered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind spun with fury. Since when did Eleanor find the courage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since she latched onto him, she walked around with a new arrogance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Vickie&#39;s stomach churn. She couldn&#39;t stand the humiliation her daughter had suffered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made up her mind to go to Lainey, certain that Lainey wouldn&#39;t let what happened to Emma slide and would make sure Eleanor paid forit.</p>
