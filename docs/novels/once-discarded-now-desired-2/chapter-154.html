                <p>Jeff was confused at first, not really grasping what Hilda was trying to say. But once she showed him the photos on her phone, things started to make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slowly let go of her hand, guided her to sit at the edge of the bed, and gave a bitter laugh before speaking. &#34;The first time I saw Eleanor, I thought the same thing you&#39;re thinking now. That&#39;s why I went straight to the orphanage she grew up in. The director told me that when they found her, there was a note tucked into her swaddling blanket. It clearly said her parents had passed away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then added in a lower voice, &#34;And besides, the DNA test results confirmed Lainey was our flesh and blood... those can&#39;t be fake, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s parents had passed away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda shot to her feet as the words sank in. She stumbled back a few steps, repeating it over and over in a daze.Her parents had died?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could that be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor looked so much like her, so how could she not be her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, it didn&#39;t add up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone must have twisted the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone must have tampered with it. She had to find Eleanor; she had to see her with her own eyes.She wanted her real daughter back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought consumed her. Before Jeff could stop her,she was out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t chase after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was better this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe once she saw the truth for herself, she would finally let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Hilda arrived at Hope House, Eleanor wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, she turned to Myah for answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah wished wvith all her heart that Eleanor could find her family, but she couldn&#39;t make up lies just to ease Hilda&#39;s pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The note really did exist. It clearly listed Eleanor&#39;s birth date and the fact that both her parents had passed away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope crumbled inside Hilda as she left the orphanage, her heart heavy with despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be true? Was Eleanor not her child after all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she refused to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she felt it, a pull too strong to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was her daughter. She had to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda just needed to find out the truth, no matter what it took. Only then could she tell Eleanor that she was her mother. But even in her desperation, she knew she couldn&#39;t recklessly drag Eleanor into this without proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t risk disrupting her life or worse, alerting the wrong people and putting Eleanor in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, with trembling restraint, Hilda decided not to seek Eleanor out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, seeing her quiet down, thought she had finally given up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved, he let the matter rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Norwood&#39;s birthday banquet came around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As one of the old pillars of power in Elepdon, his standing was unmatched, and naturally, his celebration was far more extravagant than the Benton family&#39;s welcome-home banquet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business elites filled the hall, and even key political figures, too busy to attend in person, had gifts delivered to honor him. For an event like this, every detail had to be flawless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was why Norwood had pulled Nolan aside the day before and made himself perfectly clear-do not bring Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the sleek Bentley rolled up to the Stewart family&#39;s estate and Nolan stepped out with Eleanor on his arm, the crowd rippled with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers spread instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Norwood&#39;s birthday, yet Nolan was openly bringing Eleanor here? Did this mean wedding bells were on the horizon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Norwood&#39;s temper nearly snapped. His fingers clenched so tightly around his phone it almost shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had warned Nolan more than once, but his grandson had gone ahead anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was he supposed to face the Benton family now? He had already committed to a marriage alliance with them, and whether he liked Lainey or not, he had to show the Bentons some level of respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Personally, he found Lainey sly and untrustworthy,but breaking Nolan and Eleanor apart camne first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that was handled, he could find someone better suited for Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a face hard as stone, Norwood leaned toward the butler at his side and gave curt instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, a servant made his way to Nolan and bowed politely. &#34;Mr. Stewart, your grandfather would like to see you in the study upstairs.&#34;</p>
