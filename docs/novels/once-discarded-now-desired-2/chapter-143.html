                <p>A sudden jolt of fear raced through the two servants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Lainey completely lost her mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she seriously planning to kidnap someone for everyone to see?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation hovered on their lips, but Lainey&#39;s glare sent a cold warning through them, reminding both of all the ruthless things she had pulled off in the villa recently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a silent, uneasy exchange of looks, the servants moved toward Nolan, dread weighing on every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before they could lay a finger on him, the sound of footsteps broke the tension-Eleanor strode toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her phone aloft for everyone to see, she announced in a bold, clear voice, &#34;The police are on their way.I&#39;ve already made the call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was lit up with the emergency number, leaving no doubt she was serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was seconds from getting her way, but Eleanor&#39;s sudden intervention sent a surge of anger through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! Why would you mess everything up for me?&#34; Lainey shrieked, losing control as she rushed straight at Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm and collected, Eleanor stood her ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lainey lunged, Eleanor sidestepped and, with a burst of speed, kicked Lainey hard in the knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s scream echoed as she crashed to the floor, pain robbing her of any words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t just standthere-grab her!&#34; Lainey gasped out the order, desperate and breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having thought they could stay out of trouble, the two servants hesitantly boxed Eleanor in just as Lainey It made no difference to Eleanor whether they wanted to or not-she took them down without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mere seconds later, both men were sprawled on the floor, defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gently guided Nolan to a nearby chair, then made her way over to Lainey with quiet determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered herself to meet Lainey&#39;s gaze, her voice steady and cold enough to make Lainey shiver. &#34;I caught everything on video. You drugged Nolan and tried to hurt him. There&#39;s no way out of this. The police can hear your side later, but l&#39;ve got all the proof they need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning even closer, her words barely above a whisper, she added, &#34;Honestly, I can&#39;t wait to see how your new family reacts when they finally realize who you are behind their backs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With nothing more to say, Eleanor rose to her feet, completely dismissing Lainey, whose fear had left her speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror gripped Lainey-she couldn&#39;t stop imagining herself behind bars, or the Benton family cutting her off and leaving her with nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would have done anything to go back and change her choices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Eleanor hadn&#39;t come in when she did, she would have pulled it off!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret gnawed at Lainey, heavier than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of sirens brought the moment to an end as police officers entered and took Lainey and both servants into custody.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor got Nolan settled in his Bentley, Erick&#39;s nerves were shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced back at Nolan, who looked like he was clinging to consciousness out of sheer determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flushed cheeks and glassy eyes left no doubt-Nolan had been drugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a disaster, and Erick couldn&#39;t shake the guilt for not forcing his way inside sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Nolan blame him for what happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one spared a thought for Erick&#39;s worries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor checked over Nolan&#39;s wounds, she noticed the fresh blood and couldn&#39;t hide her frustration.&#34;Seriously, Nolan? Are you trying to win some kind of award for bad decisions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even in his delirious state, Nolan picked up on her genuine worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting his head fall against her shoulder, he whispered, his breath burning against her skin, &#34;Everything I did...was for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, he still found a way to tease her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him an incredulous look and quickly told Erick up front, &#34;Get us to a hospital. Fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wasted no time getting Nolan admitted. The doctor examined him, then delivered the bad news with a heavy sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been given something strong. There isn&#39;t a direct antidote. The only way through this is for him to fight it off himself... unless...&#34; The doctor trailed off, leaving the rest unsaid, but everyone knew exactly what he meant.</p>
