                <p>Hilda could hardly contain her excitement when the message arrived, tears of joy welled up in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her daughter Had finally reached for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were finally going to see each other, what outfit would feel right for such a moment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what gift could possibly match the weight of the occasion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nerves were clearly getting to her, so she brought in a personal stylist to help craft a look that reflected warmth and quiet grace, something fitting for a poised, loving mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s eyes landed on Hilda&#39;s polished look, and confusion crept in. &#34;What&#39;s with the fancy getup?You didn&#39;t even go all out like this for Lainey&#39;s recognition event.&#34; Too distracted to engage, Hilda brushed him off with a quick excuse. &#34;I&#39;m heading to Verdant Crest to catch up with an old friend. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just another woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was careful with her answer, worried that Jeff might want to tag along if he sensed anything was amiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff fully believed in Lainey, and seeing her alongside Eleanor could shatter that trust in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her plans set, Hilda left the house in high spirits,leaving Jeff with no option but to watch her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, Lainey came downstairs, stretching and stifling a yawn. &#34;Where&#39;s Mom?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff nodded toward the door, still puzzled. &#34;She just left. Said she&#39;s meeting an old friend at Verdant Crest. I&#39;ve never seen her that happy, not even on our wedding day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without much thought, Lainey gave a shrug and dismissed it. She had wanted to borrow some jewelry from Hilda,planning a spa day with her friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being a Benton meant always looking the part, so she needed something suitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s absence didn&#39;t faze her. She was happy to help herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She explained things to Jeff, then went straight to her parents&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, she found drawers overflowing with glittering jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes widened with delight as she sifted through the treasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a goldmine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this would eventually belong to her once Hilda was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even now, while Hilda still breathed, there was no harm in slowly making it hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her daughter, slipping on a few pieces of jewelry  didn&#39;t seem unreasonable, did it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a spark of excitement, Lainey eagerly picked out a few pieces she deemed just right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right before turning to go, her eyes caught a glimpse of a photo hidden underneath the jewelry box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity getting the better of her, she picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image sent a jolt through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face stared up at her from the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff had mentioned how cheerful Hilda seemed as she left earlier. Could Hilda actually be meeting Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea rattled Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She wouldn&#39;t let things spiral out of her control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True or not, she needed answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hoped that Hilda wasn&#39;t meeting Eleanor. But if Hilda was, then she had to act fast and figure out her next move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One thing was certain. There was no way she would let anyone take her place as a Benton.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Lainey messaged her friends to cancel their spa plans, then made her way to the door in a rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, she doubled back to her room,opened a small safe in the corner, and pulled out a packet of white powder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After handling that, she dashed out of the house,leaving Jeff baffled by the sudden chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was with everyone today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jeff remained deep in thought, Hilda had already made it to Verdant Crest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got there thirty minutes early, unable to contain her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat by the window, she gazed outside,  anticipation growing with every minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, at last, she saw the familiar silhouette appear at the entrance. The sight brought tears to her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all this time, she had found her daughter. The pain of losing her never left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More than twenty years of waiting, longing, and regret had weighed on her heart every day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kept up a strong front for the sake of her three sons, but each night, loneliness and sorrow closed in, the memories of her lost-daughter haunting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one could possibly understand what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was her daughter, her own flesh and blood, the baby she had cradled through endless nights.</p>
