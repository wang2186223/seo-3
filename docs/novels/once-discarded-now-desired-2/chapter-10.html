                <p>&#34;I&#39;m divorced, and I refuse to lose myself in another man&#39;s shadow,&#34; Eleanor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s better.&#34; David&#39;s dislike of Jonny had always been clear, and he had never thought that marriage would last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he knew people often needed hardship before they could truly groW.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was convinced this ordeal would forge Eleanor into someone unshakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once her conversaion with David had reached its end,Eleanor didn&#39;t linger in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making her way toward the exhibition hall, she suddenly crossed paths with Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Emma spotted her, her face twisted with scorn. &#34;So Lillian Brooks has made you bold.Are you really so desperate to win Jonny back that you&#39;d chase him all the way here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch what you say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t act innocent. I remember how you bowed to Jonny&#39;s every whim. You&#39;ll never fool me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor recognized Emma&#39;s stupidity and chose not to waste energy. &#34;Step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely not. I&#39;m warning you, stay away from Jonny. The only woman fit to be my sister-in-law is Lainey!&#34; Emma&#39;s shrill tone carried through the hall,quickly drawing a crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate to humiliate her further, Emma raised her voice. &#34;Three years of marriage, and you couldn&#39;t even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips curved faintly as she replied, &#34;If you&#39;re so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a  doctor. The problem lies with him, not me.&#34; Those words struck like a whip, and Emma lost all composure. &#34;How dare you insult Jonny! I&#39;ll teach you a lesson right here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spoiled by the Todd family, Emma had never cared about when or where she threw her tantrums.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Emma lunged forward, Eleanor shifted lightly to the side, letting Emma stumble past and collide straight into the exhibition stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deafening crash followed as a priceless vase toppled with its glass case and shattered across the marble floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, the room froze. Security guards,guests, and staff all stared in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny appeared first, pushing through the crowd with urgency. &#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She shoved me!&#34; Emma wasted no time, pointing at Eleanor. &#34;She kept insulting me, then pushed me straight into the display!&#34; &lt;</p>
