                <p>Lainey was practically glowing with satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, it already felt like the Benton Group&#39;s shares belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Benton couple completely charmed byher,what could Eleanor possibly do to stop her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Buzzing with excitement, she slipped into a chic outfit and headed out for shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she entered a luxury boutique, she didn&#39;t bother sparing the price tags a single glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll take this one, that one... oh, and that too,&#34; she said airily, tilting her chin toward the sales associate who was scurrying after her. &#34;Wrap up those handbags for me. I&#39;m buying them all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bold display quickly drew attention. Shoppers paused mid-step, whispering and stealing glances filled with both envy and awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey basked in it, soaking up every bit of admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the moment she longed for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted everyone to see with their own eyes that she wasn&#39;t the useless Gilbert girl anymore, no longer someone who had to bow and scrape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she was part of the Benton family, standing tall and untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as she was reveling in her moment, a crisp voice broke through the chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m here to pick up the custom bag I ordered earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd parted slightly as Lillian walked in,heading straight toward the counter with her usual confident stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood Lainey, the center of attention,with eyes  glued to her from every side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed head-to-toe in luxury, she was trying so hard to flaunt her wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Lillian, it was gaudy and pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales associate, recognizing Lillian right away,hurried to the counter and pulled out an elegant box from under it. &#34;Ms. Brooks, this is your custom piece.Please check if everything is in order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s gaze locked on the box instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The logo gave it away. It belonged to the brand&#39;s most exclusive line, the kind of product that couldn&#39;t just be bought with money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at Lillian, her eyes lighting up with an idea. Without thinking twice, she grabbed the box from the salesperson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one&#39;s beautiful,&#34; she said smoothly, running her fingers over it as though it already belonged to her.&#34;Add it to my purchases too.&#34; The sales associate was caught off guard and stammered awkwardly, &#34;This item was specially made for Ms. Brooks...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes went cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t surprised. Lainey was trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;First come, first served, Lainey. Haven&#39;t you heard of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey threw back her head and laughed, as if someone had just told the worId&#39;s silliest joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re kidding, right?&#34; She toyed with the box in her hands, her eyes flicking over Lillian with open disdain. &#34;I want it, so I&#39;ll take it. What&#39;s the problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear she was just picking on Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Brooks family was no longer a threat to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she cemented her position as the new branch CEO of the Benton Group, wiping out the Brooks family would be child&#39;s play.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stayed calm, completely ignoring Lainey&#39;s  smug expression, and let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her wrist to glance at her watch,uninterested in wasting her time on someone like Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some people can only show off in boutiques like this,&#34; Lillian said lightly. &#34;No matter how loud she shouts, she still won&#39;t marry into the Stewart family,will she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze softened with quiet condescension. &#34;Look at my friend Eleanor. She doesn&#39;t even have to make an effort, and Nolan&#39;s heart is already hers. Go ahead, take the bag if it pleases you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waved her hand casually, treating the bag like nothing valuable. &#34;I&#39;m feeling generous today, so think of it as a little gift from me out of pity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Lillian turned gracefully and walked away,leaving Lainey fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s face burned red with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared this woman humiliate her in public? Lainey clenched her fists, silently swearing that she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>would one day make the Brooks family pay.</p>
