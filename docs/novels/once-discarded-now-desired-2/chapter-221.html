                <p>Lainey had no clue what was really in that document or what Jeff was scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to ask about the shares when she glanced up and caught Jeff staring at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth that usually softened his eyes was gone,replaced by a sharp, probing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic bubbled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he staring at her like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the document about her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing her nerves into a polite mask, Lainey leaned in slightly,tilting her head with a soft, sweet smnile.&#34;Dad,when are we going to finalize the transfer for the shares? Didn&#39;t you say we&#39;d handle it in a couple of days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s eyes flicked to the document one last time before snapping it shut. His mind was a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The DNA test wouldn&#39;t lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And he hadn&#39;t been there for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mistakes, the neglect, all of it pressed on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had failed to protect her, failed to guide her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite those thoughts, he didn&#39;t act on impulse. He shoved the document into a nearby bag and shook his head at her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No rush,&#34; he said firmly. &#34;Let&#39;s wait until your brothers are back from Breoqua. We&#39;ll do the signing ceremony when the whole family is together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s smile disappeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t this been settled already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why drag it out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton boys&#39; return...how would that help her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger bubbled up inside her as her eyes fell on the document.Jeff&#39;s mood had clearly changed after he saw it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of nonsense had Ryland fed him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her gaze,Jeff softened slightly, as if he could read her thoughts. &#34;You&#39;re my daughter.Everything from your mom and me will eventually be yours. Be patient, okay? I have things to handle in the study now.Make sure you rest well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, he got up, grabbed the document and disappeared into the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes followed him, burning with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get a look at that document.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until then, she couldn&#39;t feel calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor woke to an odd,uncomfortable pressure against her back the next morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something hard was pressing into her, and it immediately put her on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still groggy,she reached behind her to shift whatever it was, then froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers brushed against... something unexpected. Her eyes shot open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep evaporated in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart started racing as she carefully felt again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The texture, the thickness... it all clicked. Panic prickled up her spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to jump up, to put distance between herself and the source of the discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could even twist, Nolan rolled over her,pinning her in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes went wide. &#34;Nolan?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice rumbled low, still lazy with the haze of morning, right in her ear. &#34;You&#39;re awake. About that little move just now, were you trying to tempt me?Because if you were... well, I&#39;m always ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face went red with a mix of shock, anger,and pure embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shoved against his chest with all her might. &#34;Nolan!When did you sneak into my bed? Get off me!&#34;</p>
