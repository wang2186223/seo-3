                <p>Ryland&#39;s smile carried softness, yet his gaze stayed as cold as ice. &#34;Funny, Brice. You didn&#39;t look so meek when you were picking on my friend a moment ago,did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your... your friend?&#34; Brice turned his head toward Eleanor with disbelief before dropping to his knees,pleading, &#34;Mr. Brooks, I was out of line! I swear I had no idea she was close to you. I&#39;d never dare touch her if I had known. It was foolish of me. Please, give me another chance, I swear I&#39;ll never repeat it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept lowering his head over and over, begging like a man desperate to save himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Ryland waved him off with clear contempt.&#34;Fine. You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m in a good mood today, so I&#39;ll let it go. Now get out of my sight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr. Brooks.&#34; Brice stumbled toward the door, nearly falling as he bolted from the club.  Lillian came rushing in just as he disappeared, her face tight with worry. &#34;Eleanor, are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head and replied, &#34;No, I&#39;m alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief swept over Lillian, and she turned toward her brother. &#34;Ryland, thank heavens you showed up. We really owe you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland chuckled softly as he patted her hair. &#34;What matters to you matters to me. You don&#39;t need to thank me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor dipped her head politely. &#34;Thank you, Mr.Brooks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to be formal with me. You spilled plenty of wine. Go wash it off before it dries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Eleanor got up and headed for the restroom,though midway she crossed paths with Jonny, who had Lainey by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey greeted her with a bright smile. &#34;Miss Warren,what a lovely surprise.&#34; Eleanor acknowledged her with the faintest nod,making no effort to continue the exchange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence left Lainey stiff and uneasy. She turned to Jonny with a wounded expression. &#34;Jonny, did I upset Miss Warren somehow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown formed on Jonny&#39;s face. &#34;She&#39;s trying to greet you, and you can&#39;t even respond properly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tilted her head, unimpressed. &#34;Since when were we so close?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t get upset with Miss Warren on my account,&#34;Lainey said quickly, clutching Jonny&#39;s hand with feigned gentleness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What nonsense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor decided it wasn&#39;t worth another word and turned to go, but Jonny&#39;s irritated voice cut through the noise. &#34;If you&#39;re trying to draw me in, you don&#39;t need to humiliate yourself. My heart belongs to Lainey. No matter how much you try, it&#39;s pointless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all she needed to confirm he had  completely lost touch with reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lifted to his, calm but sharp. &#34;I didn&#39;t step foot in this place for your sake. I came to enjoy myself. And let me remind you-we&#39;re divorced.You don&#39;t get to lecture me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chill in her tone left Jonny restless. He couldn&#39;t grasp how the gentle, compliant woman he once married had turned into someone so unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren, how can you speak like that? Jonny only means well,&#34; Lainey interjected quickly, trying to defend Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze swept over them, full of disdain.&#34;Please. You&#39;re just a cheating husband and a shameless homewrecker. Do either of you really have the right to stand before me as ifyou&#39;re proud of it?Step aside. I have no time for nonsense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With heels striking the floor like sharp notes, Eleanor swept past them, her crimson dress flowing around her like a rose in full bloom. Jonny&#39;s fists clenched as he stared after her, his chest burning. How had he lived all this time without realizing she carried such fire on her tongue?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey reached for his hand and said softly, &#34;Don&#39;t let her get under your skin, Jonny. Come back inside with me. Emma is waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression darkened, yet he gave no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she had been overseas, he missed her every day. Yet now, with her right beside him, her presence felt strangely empty. Perhaps Eleanor&#39;s defiance had clouded his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Together they turned and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the private room, Ryland observed it all through the wide glass window. &#34;I never imagined she was Jonny&#39;s wife. That makes things rather amusing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sex-wife,actually,&#34; Nolan corrected firmly.</p>
