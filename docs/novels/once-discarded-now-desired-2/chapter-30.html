                <p>Jonny had no clue about the surprise Eleanor was preparing for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for the suit jacket draped neatly on the chair, then rose to his feet to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his movements, Lainey quickly pushed herself up from the sofa. &#34;Jonny, where are you off to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight pause followed before Jonny spoke with a perfectly straight face. &#34;Something urgent came up at the office. I have to go back and deal with it. You shouldn&#39;t stay up for me tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of an emergency that required him to stay out all night didn&#39;t make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suspicion flickered in Lainey&#39;s eyes, and she was ready to confront him, but he slipped out the door  before she could say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sinking down onto the sofa, she absentmindedly twisted the hem of her shirt between her fingers.A feeling of unease settled over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny never behaved this way. Unless...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as that possibility crept into her mind,Lainey&#39;s fingernails pressed hard into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could not let that be true. If it was, she might just kill him herself. There was no way she was letting go of the Todd legacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes ticked by before Jonny arrived outside Room 888 at the Lumina Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of excitement buzzed through him from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That image of Eleanor from the club, lookingSO inviting, stayed vivid in his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three years had passed, and he had almost lost control more than once. Now, Jonny actually wished  he hadn&#39;t held back all this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, nothing would stop him from finally having what he wanted with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about it, Jonny could hardly keep his cool while pushing open the hotel room door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint shape could be seen on the bed. Curves and bare skin were outlined by the thin, suggestive fabric she wore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny couldn&#39;t help feeling amazed that someone he thought was so boring could turn out to be this bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Missing out for three years really stung now that he saw what she had to offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved closer, only for an unusual, thick perfume to catch him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took less than a minute before his head started spinning and the world around him became a blur.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sounds turned fuzzy, and he barely recognized a voice speaking nearby.  Coherent thought quickly faded, leaving him overwhelmed by instinct and want.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunrise found Jonny waking with a sense of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sheets next to him were cold, and Eleanor was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puzzled, Jonny wondered what kind of stunt she was pulling now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes of last night flickered in his mind, and though everything felt cloudy, he remembered having a great time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this was her new tactic, he figured he might keep her around for a while, at least until he grew tired of her and could toss her aside without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, his phone buzzed unexpectedly with a new message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he tapped the screen, Jonny&#39;s hand shook so badly he almost dropped the phone. Confusion  swept over him. Since when had he ended up in bed with a lifelike doll?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still reeling, he stared at the screen as another message appeared. &#34;How do you like my surprise,dear ex-husband?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He froze in disbelief. Could it be that Eleanor had never been there last night, and he had actually spent the night with a realistic doll?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth hit Jonny, and panic scattered his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lurched out of bed, grabbed the phone, and called the front desk. &#34;Show me last night&#39;s hallway footage from outside Room 888.Right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, Mr. Todd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Authority had its perks. Jonny might not control the whole city, but as CEO, his requests always got top priority at the Lumina Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few minutes passed before the footage arrived in his inbox.  Jonny scrolled quickly, his nerves fraying as he scanned every second. There was no sign of Eleanor anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, what he saw was a cleaner with a covered cart, entering before he ever showed up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That had to be when the doll was delivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment and fury boiled inside Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed Eleanor for tricking him so easily, and the possibility of leaked photos made his skin crawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the CEO of Todd Group, he could never live this down if the story got out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping his phone so tightly his knuckles turned white, Jonny could hardly contain his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hammered out a message. &#34;Eleanor, erase every picture. Come here now, or you&#39;ll regret crossing me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then sent it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An angry red exclamation mark flashed on the screen  a moment later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury almost made him snap his phone in half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she really blocked him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three years, that woman had chased after him,and now she shut him out completely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Admitting the truth to himself, Jonny knew he felt rattled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet what he did not realize was that things could,and would,get even worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing he had experienced so far compared to the humiliation waiting for him next.</p>
