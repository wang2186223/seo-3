                <p>Eleanor had no idea what was brewing behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she and Fannie got back to the villa in Regal Heights, she found Nolan already downstairs,sitting quietly on the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick gesture, Eleanor signaled to Fannie and made her way into the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever Fannie had whispered to Nolan must have worked,because by the time Eleanor reappeared,his mood had noticeably improved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In no time, six dishes were arranged on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them gathered around, laughter and warmth filling the room as they enjoyed their meal together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they had finished eating, Fannie, ever the spark of the group,suggested,&#34;Nolan,Eleanor,tomorrow&#39;s the weekend. Let&#39;s go camping! My friends say the countryside is gorgeous this time of year, and there are fireflies at night!&#34; She had picked up on Nolan&#39;s earlier sadness and wanted to cheer him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and Nolan exchanged uncertain glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not one to give up, Fannie clung to Eleanor&#39;s arm and pleaded, &#34;Please? You hardly ever have time for me!All my friends have been there, but I haven&#39;t gotten to go yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to say no to Fannie&#39;s earnest request,Eleanor gave in and agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Eleanor on board, Nolan saw no reason to object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as their camping plans were settled, Hilda&#39;s call came through. &#34;Eleanor, where are you? I made you a nourishing soup. Hurry home or it&#39;ll get cold!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the phone was on speaker, Nolan could hear Hilda&#39;s familiar, caring voice loud and clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear Hilda was anxious for Eleanor to come home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a quiet sigh, Nolan rose to his feet. &#34;I&#39;ll drive you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon enough, the car pulled up outside the Benton family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor released her seatbelt, but didn&#39;t step out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted her gaze toward the man sitting next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pale streetlight spilled through the window, outlining his sharply defined features in a gentle wash of shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan met her gaze, his eyes warm and steady. &#34;I&#39;ll be here at nine tomorrow morning to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Eleanor replied, finally unbuckling her seatbelt before leaning over to wrap him in a gentle embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say a word, but Nolan understood the comfort behind her touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held her close, letting his chin rest lightly atop her head. &#34;Try to get some sleep,&#34; he murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, Nolan and Fannie were packed up and ready to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they headed toward the door, a taxi pulled up,blocking their path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The taxi door swung open, and a young woman in a white dress stepped out, suitcase in tow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her small face looked drained of color, her eyes puffy  and rimnmed with red; she had clearly been crying, and the sadness on her face made her look especially fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her eyes landed on Nolan, Elora Tyree froze,her gaze flooding with tears. &#34;Nolan, I&#39;ve missed you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan looked at her for a moment, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recognition flickered in his eyes and, almost unconsciously,his features softened. &#34;Elora? When did you get back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora was practically his family, a maid&#39;s daughter,raised by Reyna after her own mother died giving birth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With only a two-year age gap between them, Elora and Nolan had grown up side by side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later,when Reyna was expecting Fannie, the maid&#39;s widower returned and brought Elora overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From that day forward, she and Nolan had gone their separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, despite the years, a piece of Nolan&#39;s heart had always remained with her. To him, she was like a little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity lighting up her face, Fannie studied the newcomer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered Lilah mentioning Nolan&#39;s childhood friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cheerful smile, she stepped forward.&#34;You must be Elora, I&#39;ve heard so much about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora looked pleasantly startled by Fannie&#39;s warm greeting. &#34;And you&#39;re Fannie, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
