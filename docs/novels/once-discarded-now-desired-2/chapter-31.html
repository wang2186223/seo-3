                <p>No one in Elepdon&#39;s high society held as much influence as Nolan. His network of contacts stretched wider than anyone else&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a few minutes after Jonny watched the security video,one of Nolan&#39;s sources brought him the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impressed and amused, Nolan considered how bold the move had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling off such a stunt took real nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny must be out of his mind if he still planned to chase after Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly,Jonny needed to be taught a lesson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a quiet order. &#34;Tell the shareholders to put the squeeze on Jonny. We need to keep him busy.&#34; By doing this, Nolan ensured Jonny would be too occupied to bother Eleanor anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, Mr. Stewart,&#34; Erick repliedright away before stepping out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left by himself, Nolan quickly sent Eleanor a message, curiosity clear in his tone. &#34;That was quite a spectacle. I enjoyed every minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor sat at the bar, staring at the message with mixed feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s reputation for gathering secrets was no exaggeration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he seemed to have far too much time on his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he so invested in her life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this interest personal, or did he have another motive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was inclined to believe the latter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t narcissistic. A handful of encounters with Nolan hardly counted as anything meaningful between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she thought about it, Eleanor saw nothing in herself that would catch Nolan&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing was a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the best of Lillian when she noticed Eleanor staring off into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the screen, Lillian let out a dramatic gasp. &#34;Since when did you and Mr. Stewart getSO close? Girl, you&#39;re playing with fire. That&#39;s not a man you want to get involved with!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wanting to leave her friend confused,Eleanor went ahead and explained what Jonny had pulled off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word made Lillian angrier, her cheeks flushed bright red as she slammed her foot down on the little table in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What a dirtbag! How can people like him keep popping up? Why does he always have to mess up your peace?&#34; Lillian seethed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long sigh followed her outburst, but then Lillian&#39;s eyes grew wide with a new realization. &#34;Hold up. How did Nolan get the scoop so fast? Don&#39;t tell me he&#39;s been tracking your every move!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worry crept into her voice. &#34;That&#39;s a scary thought,Eleanor! Never mind how handsome Nolan is or how everyone calls him the catch of the city. You should keep your distance. People say he can&#39;t... you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reputation for keeping to himself? In Lillian&#39;s mind, it was just his way of hiding his so-called problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the last word left her lips, Lillian gave it an extra flourish,and Eleanor nearly spit out her drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could not believe that rumor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything, Nolan never struck her as someone with that kind of secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian could launch into another rant, Eleanor chimed in, &#34;Calm down. There&#39;s nothing going on between me and him. We&#39;ve hardly talked at all. He probably just stumbled on something and decided to send that message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words finally got Lillian to quiet down, but the more she mulled it over, the weirder the situation seemed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No explanation made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would someone as busy as Nolan, a man at the top of Elepdon&#39;s business world, waste time poking into Eleanor&#39;s affairs?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As questions piled up in her mind, Lillian glanced at Eleanor&#39;s steady face and bit her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Best to let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she kept asking, maybe Eleanor would start thinking about Nolan for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absolutely not!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It would be wiser if nothing was said about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men only caused headaches anyway! Still, Lillian was never one to keep her worries bottled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, once she got home, she let it all out to Ryland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Ryland and Nolan were friends, maybe he could step in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland noticed the frustration written all over Lillian&#39;s face and gave her a gentle pat on the head. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Stop fussing. Nolan&#39;s choices aren&#39;t for us to question. If he does have a crush on your friend,there&#39;s really nothing we can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, &#34;With the difference in their social standing, even if they did like each other, being together would be nearly impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s temper flared. &#34;Hold on, what&#39;s that supposed to mean? You obviously don&#39;t know Eleanor.She&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Enigma!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth snapped shut just before she blurted out too much, determined not to reveal Eleanor&#39;s secret. She pressed her teeth against her lip in defiance.&#34;Regardless of what you think, Eleanor is wonderful,and you have no right to speak of her that way. Tell Nolan he had better forget about entertaining any thoughts of Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan truly ended up with Eleanor, wouldn&#39;t that mean she would be trapped in a lifetime of loneliness beside a man who could never satisfy her? The thought alone felt unbearably cruel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland picked up on his sister&#39;s stubbornness right away and raised his hands in defeat. &#34;Alright, alright,your friend is the best. Satisfied? I&#39;ve got things to take care of, so I&#39;m out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, he hurried off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arguing with women was always a losing game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he couldn&#39;t win the battle, he might as well make a quick retreat!</p>
