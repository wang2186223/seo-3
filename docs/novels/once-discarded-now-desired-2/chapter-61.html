                <p>Once the banquet drew to an end, the city lights gradually shimmered to life outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting a chance when nobody was paying attention, Eleanor approached Fannie and took a quick peek at her not far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie&#39;s face looked bright and healthy, and her whole energy felt vibrant and spirited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As long as Fannie took it easy, there likely wouldn&#39;t be any serious issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, Eleanor turned away and returned to the apartment with Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian barely made it through the door before flopping onto the couch, grinning from ear to ear.&#34;Eleanor, did you see Lainey? She couldn&#39;t even wait for the banquet to end before storming out! She&#39;s definitely hiding something! I swear, I can&#39;t get over it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory of Lainey struggling to look calm while panicking inside made Lillian all the more pleased with herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Lillian so delighted, Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but smile, too. Before she could say a word, her phone started buzzing on the coffee table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s name flashed on the screen. &#34;Sorry to bother you, boss. Here&#39;s the situation. There&#39;s a lady in the shop saying she&#39;s getting married soon. She wants a custom wedding gown done right away and doesn&#39;t care what it costs. She insists we accept her request.I honestly don&#39;t know what to do, so I wanted to ask you first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian overheard Betsy&#39;s call thanks to her sharp ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement danced in her eyes as she chimed in with a sly grin, &#34;Eleanor, you can&#39;t pass this up! Just think about it, your design on that manipulator at her own wedding. That&#39;ll be a sight to see!&#34; If there was drama to be found, Lillian wanted a front-row seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Eleanor found herself intrigued by Lainey&#39;s little scheme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smirk appeared on Eleanor&#39;s face as she responded with ease, &#34;Go ahead and accept the order. Just make sure she knows the fee is $10million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;$10 million?&#34; Besty&#39;s voice shot up in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally,their custom gowns didn&#39;t go for more than five million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That amount sounded outrageous, as if they were demanding a fortune fit for royalty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Eleanor had given her orders, and Besty wasn&#39;t about to argue. &#34;Understood, boss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she ended the call, Besty headed over to where Lainey was waiting and flashed her a cheerful grin.&#34;Miss Gilbert, the main office has approved your request,Because the deadline is so tight, all the designers and craftspeople will need to work extra hours. As for the price-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of excitement showed on Lainey&#39;s face as she interjected, &#34;Whatever it costs, I&#39;ll pay it. Just tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She figured, no matter how fancy a dress could be,the price tag couldn&#39;t possibly be outrageous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty offered a calm smile and raised ten fingers.&#34;$10 million.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s happiness faded on the spot, her eyes going wide with disbelief. &#34;W-what did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, Besty kept her polite expression and repeated, &#34;$10 million, Miss Gilbert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of money could easily snatch up a whole collection of top-tier gowns from other luxury brands!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma&#39;s creations rarely broke the five million mark before, so when did their prices shoot up like this? Was Besty seriously trying to puIl one over on her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey felt the urge to walk out then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her pride held her back. She had already promised everyone her intentions-failing to get the dress now would only make her look ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She feared the thought of becoming the punchline among the socialites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way she would let herself endure that kind of humiliation!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she wasn&#39;t the one paying the bill, anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined not to lose face, she squared her shoulders and forced out a response. &#34;Alright, you&#39;ve got a deal! $10 million!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shook as Lainey filled out the paperwork for the custom gown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, in her mind, it was a fair price to pay for all eyes on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor would never outshine her.</p>
