                <p>Nolan brushed past without a word, his steps halting only when he reached the glinting shards that littered the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland strolled up beside him, smirking as he looked down. &#34;That piece was a real treasure-a rare antique, famous for its craftsmanship. Mr.Gill jumped through hoops to bring it here from overseas. What a shame to see it end up like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a hint of regret, but the amusement in his eyes betrayed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, who had only glimpsed Nolan once before,had secretly built up a fantasy of becoming his bride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with Nolan standing before her again, she wasted no time feigning innocence. &#34;Blame Eleanor for this mess. Anyway, she&#39;s been getting pretty close to the Brooks girl. With their help, replacing one broken vase is nothing-she could probably fill the whole hall with new ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had always found Emma&#39;s shamelessness impressive, but today&#39;s performance was a new record.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without so much as a change in expression, Nolan turned to Eleanor, who had yet to speak a word.&#34;Miss Warren, do you really have nothing to say for yourself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Situations like this called for evidence, not empty words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor held Nolan&#39;s gaze, steady and calm. &#34;The exhibition hall is under surveillance. Checking the security footage will clear everything up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s face drained of color, and she nearly stumbled in panic. Of all things, she had not counted on the security cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland leaned back with a lazy shrug, his tone almost gentle. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be so sure, Miss Warren. This spot&#39;s a blind spot. Odds are the cameras didn&#39;t catch a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of relief washed over Emma. With no video evidence, she could spin any story she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to make Eleanor pay, she put on her most curious expression. &#34;Does anyone here know antiques? I&#39;d love to hear what that vase was really worth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ensemble of collectors stepped forward,their voices ringing with authority. &#34;Word is, Mr. Gill shelled out $1.5 billion at an auction overseas.Honestly, that vase was supposed to worth even more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One point five billion. The number hit like a thunderclap. Even for the Brooks family, that kind of cash wasn&#39;t just lying around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an air of triumph, Emma shot Eleanor a smug look. &#34;Did you catch that? We&#39;re talking $1.5 billion.Hope you&#39;ve got a miracle up your sleeve. If you can&#39;t pay, we&#39;ll let the police handle you-maybe you&#39;ll have better luck behind bars.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While others expected her to crumble, Eleanor stood tall, completely unfazed by the threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan watched her, eyes narrowed, silently wondering how she would manage to get out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, growing more agitated by the second, shifted his weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hated the thought of his ex-wife facing charges,but that sum was outrageous-even for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every eye in the room stayed fixed on Eleanor,waiting for her to break or plead. Instead, she calmly lifted her phone and hit play on a voice recording.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room filled with Emma&#39;s own sneering words.&#34;Three years of marriage, and you couldn&#39;t even give him a child. Just look at yourself-plain,broke, and worthless. Do you honestly think you can measure up to Lainey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flared in Emma&#39;s eyes. She lunged for Eleanor&#39;s phone, but Nolan stepped in front of her,cutting off her attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cold smirk, Nolan turned to Jonny. &#34;Is this how your family raises your sister,Jonny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s jaw tightened as he yanked Emma back and snapped, &#34;Enough, Emma. You&#39;ve gone too far.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never in her life had Emma seen Jonny glare at her with so much anger. She shrank behind him,suddenly small and shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let the recording play on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own voice rang out. &#34;If you&#39;re so worried about children, maybe have Jonny see a doctor. The problem lies with him, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s furious voice followed. &#34;How dare you insult Jonny! I&#39;ll teach you a lesson right here!&#34;</p>
