                <p>The Internet erupted like wildfire, comment threads exploding in every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the noise of nameless netizens, Lillian&#39;s words carried weight-and the evidence she dropped hit harder than anything that came before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her screenshots were crisp, undeniable, nothing like the blurry fabrications from the earlier smear campaign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Netizens might be quick to gossip, but they weren&#39;t idiots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, the crowd realized they had been manipulated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s Twitter page was instantly swarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So we&#39;ve been tricked? Turns out Lainey Todd is the real villain!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable-she even faked charity donations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five million magically shrank to fifty thousand? That&#39;s not charity, that&#39;s daylight robbery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the Todd Group had a hand in this too!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian scrolled through the chaos, satisfaction dancing on her lips-until her expression froze mid-smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as though time itself had stopped, a chill gripping her out of nowhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the very next instant, Lillian&#39;s eyes flewwide, locked on her phone as if she couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face lit with shock, the kind that made her look as though the floor had shifted beneath her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot up from the couch, jammed her feet into her shoes, and dashed into the kitchen, nearly skidding to a stop as she shoved her phone in front of Eleanor, who was calmly stirring a pot on the stove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One name burned on the screen-Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had actually reposted her call-out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And worse, he hadn&#39;t left it at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor Warren treats the world with kindness, yet shows no mercy to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were followed by a sorrowful emoji, dripping with wounded self-pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s hand froze on the spoon, her mind momentarily blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, the comments beneath Nolan&#39;s post were exploding in real time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on-did Nolan Stewart just post?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I hallucinating, or is that really the head of Stewart Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not hallucinating! I&#39;ve stalked his account forever, and he&#39;s finally alive online!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, wait, is he hinting at Eleanor? Is this some kind of confession?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, that came out of nowhere!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the Todd family tossed her aside, and now the head of Stewart Group is the one declaring his love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How reckless could Nolan be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A private confession would have been enough, yet he had to plaster it across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it ever cross his mind what she might feel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor forced herself to look away, feigning composure as the glow of the screen faded from her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the warmth blooming in her cheeks betrayed her attempt at calm. With a sharp snap, Lillian shut her phone and squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! Did you see that? Nolan Stewart actually confessed to you! He&#39;s the man every single woman in Elepdon is dying to marry! Oh my God, this is legendary, and I am living for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her excitement, Lillian&#39;s earlier worries evaporated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, Nolan, the man who always avoided romance, had bared his feelings to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly felt like nothing could stand in the way of what they had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Differences in status? Irrelevant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The swarm of women vying for Nolan&#39;s attention? Meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan and Eleanor seemed like they were made for each other. He carried himself with a cool, refined air,while she burned with independence and fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s squealing grated on Eleanor until she could barely take it anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a light tap on her friend&#39;s head, Eleanor said, &#34;Dinner&#39;s ready. Quit making a fuss and sit down to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Food, however, didn&#39;t hold a candle to the unfolding gossip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eyes sparkling with mischief, Lillian dialed Ryland. &#34;Hey, is Nolan with you? I&#39;ve got questions, and I&#39;m dying to get a quote from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the line, Ryland nearly choked on his coffee. &#34;Are you out of your mind, Lillian? That&#39;s his business with Eleanor. You&#39;ve got no reason to stick your nose in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time ever, he hung up on his sister without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some things were simply too personal to be dragged into her antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately after Nolan&#39;s post went live, Norwood Stewart, his grandfather, was on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan answered and entered the study. Out of curiosity, Ryland approached the study, and pressed his ear against the door,trying to eavesdrop their conversation. Though he couldn&#39;t catch a word of the exchange, Ryland guessed that it wouldn&#39;t be a pleasant conversation.</p>
