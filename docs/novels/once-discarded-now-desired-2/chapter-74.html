                <p>It didn&#39;t take long before Nolan stepped out of the study, with an unreadable expression on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his gaze met Ryland&#39;s, the air grew tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland coughed lightly, trying to ease the mood. &#34;So, did your grandpa lecture you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; Nolan replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland nodded knowingly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Norwood would never approve of a granddaughter-in-law like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Nolan&#39;s family history was a scar etched deep. His father, Colson Stewart, had once been married to Reyna Freeman, a celebrated socialite from Elepdon and Nolan&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their marriage had started in harmony, full of promise, but everything fell apart when Ady Yates, daughter of a maid in the Freeman household, who had grown up alongside Reyna, got involved with Colson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The affair tore the family apart. Reyna&#39;s heartbreak consumed her, and she ultimately ended her own life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lost his mother, and worse, Colson&#39;s affection for him turned into neglect and cruelty once Ady gave birth to a son of her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Norwood who finally intervened, taking Nolan away and raising him under his direct care. Later, when Nolan proved his ability, Norwood even skipped over Colson entirely and handed the Stewart Group straight to his grandson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To see Nolan, so usually reserved, almost indifferent, suddenly speaking of love was enough to rattle Norwood. He feared history repeating itself, feared Nolan losing himself the way Colson once had. That was why he had made the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Colson, his cruelty was beyond doubt. He had been living a carefree life in Zerovia with Ady and their son, completely abandoning Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if there was one thing Nolan despised, it was pity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the weight behind Nolan&#39;s silence, Ryland quickly lowered his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s aura had gone ice-cold in an instant, and Ryland nearly trembled under it. &#34;Sorry, Nolan.I went too far. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cursed himself silently. What had he been thinking, eavesdropping like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Ryland regretted his slip, across town at the Todd family&#39;s villa, Lainey was livid. She smashed her phone to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all times, why would Nolan choose now to confess to Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone as untouchable as Nolan possibly fall for a plain woman like Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t allow it. No, she had to tear them apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor truly ended up with Nolan, everything would be lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey wore a groove in the floor with her pacing, trying to figure out her next move, when the villa door suddenly swung open with a loud bang..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And from the storm on his face, he was anything but calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lainey could slip into her usual act of looking pitiful, Jonny was already towering over her, his shadow swallowing her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed her by the collar, his fury pouring out through gritted teeth.&#34;Look at the mess you&#39;ve caused!Wasn&#39;t the disaster at the wedding enough? Why do you keep stirring things up? Now the whole Internet is dragging our family through the mud. Is that what you wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had done everything possible to avoid clashing with the Stewart and the Brooks families, yet Lainey couldn&#39;t keep herself from stirring the pot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she think the Todd Group was untouchable? That no matter how badly she messed up, nothing would ever happen to it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The anger blazing in his eyes made Lainey want to slap him, but she held herself back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t secured control of the Todd Group yet, and crossing him now would only backfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So instead, she forced tears to her eyes and crumpled into her pitiful routine. &#34;Jonny, I swear it wasn&#39;t me.l didn&#39;t post anything. It was Lillian and Eleanor who set me up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when her tears would have cut right through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, he felt only a cold distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evidence pointed straight to her, and still she refused to admit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he ended up married to someone so manipulative, so reckless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusted, Jonny shoved her away and stormed off toward the study withou a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey dropped onto the sofa, her face twisting with hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, she told herself, Jonny would regret ever treating her this way.</p>
