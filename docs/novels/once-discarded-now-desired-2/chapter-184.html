                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart pounded in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t dare lift her gaze until she was certain Fraser had gone far enough for his figure to vanish from sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words still echoed in her mind that he had probably figured out her little scheme to get him out of the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was hardly a concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With him gone, she could finally handle Jeff and Hilda however she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Fraser returned from Breoqua, she would have everything under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Securing the shares was the priority. Being a Benton by blood was irrelevant; soon enough, she would be living a life of luxury regardless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, though, she had to make sure the paternity test was altered and any suspicion about Eleanor wiped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then could she pressure them into signing over the shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff had claimed Hilda went out for a spa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey knew better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda had gone specifically to get Eleanor&#39;s hair samples. But it didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace had ways to handle the labs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly sent him a text, saying, &#34;Hilda is making her move. Make sure everything&#39;s in place to keep it smooth.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped the phone back into her purse and pressed the elevator button. When she reached the lobby, a loud voice stopped her in her tracks. A woman with a slightly rounded belly was arguing furiously at the Billing Department, hidden behind a mask, sunglasses, and a hat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t treat me like this! I come from a good family! I lost my wallet. I don&#39;t have cash! Just let me go. I&#39;Il pay later!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey/&#39;s eyes narrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That voice belonged to Emma? Pregnant? How had that happened?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had no plan to get involved. She just gave a sarcastic smirk and started walking toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then an idea struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Jonny tied up in his own matters, he probably hadn&#39;t been keeping an eye on his sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, broke and expecting a child, was an easy target.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People in desperation could be manipulated, and with a little nudge, she might not be able to ruin Eleanor entirely, but she could certainly make things difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly grin spread across Lainey&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked over, drew a card from her purse, and handed it to the nurse. &#34;I&#39;ll take care of her bill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma froze, her eyes widening in shock. &#34;Lainey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across her face. If Lainey knew she was pregnant and told Jonny... she didn&#39;t even want to think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mumbling a quick, awkward thanks, she tried to slip away, but Lainey wasn&#39;t done with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught up effortlessly and called in a sweet, concerned tone, &#34;Emma, do you need some help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma stopped and turned back slowly, feeling confused inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brother had warned her that Lainey was cunning, sly, and untrustworthy, but she had never believed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, in this moment of vulnerability, it was Lainey offering help. Could someone so thoughtful really be a bad person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be that Jonny had been misled by false rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Lainey standing there, calm and gentle, Emma felt warmth bloom in her chest. Her eyes glistened,and her voice trembled as she whispered, &#34;Please, don&#39;t tell anyone about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her lip before continuing, &#34;Could you...maybe lend me a bit more money?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey gave a soft, understanding nod, looking calm and harmless. &#34;Emma, there&#39;s no need to be so formal between us. If you need anything, just say so. It&#39;s just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, feigning a small sigh of embarrassment. &#34;I don&#39;t really have much on me at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s been interfering between me and my mom, and my allowance got cut because of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s blood boiled instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That conniving woman had manipulated Jonny and now even tormented Lainey!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was a Benton, the pride of the Todd family!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way was she going to sit by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to take some weight off Lainey&#39;s shoulders and make sure Eleanor never got the chance to hurt her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, when good opportunities came around, Lainey would think of her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making a silent promise to herself, Emma looked at Lainey with determination. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lainey. I&#39;ll make sure Eleanor doesn&#39;t get her way. She won&#39;t be able to cause much trouble for long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey immediately displayed a look of panic and grabbed Emma&#39;s hand. &#34;Emma, don&#39;t do anything reckless,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her caution didn&#39;t stop her from acting. With a quiet motion, she slid her bank card into Emma&#39;s palm.&#34;Take this $100, 000. It&#39;s all I have right now. Use it if you absolutely need it. And promise me you won&#39;t do anything risky. If you need me, I&#39;ll be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma stared at the card, touched by her gesture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she realized just how kind Lainey truly was. Her resentment toward Eleanor flared hotter than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, Eleanor would truly pay for what she had done.</p>
