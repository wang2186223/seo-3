                <p>Nolan had no idea that Norwood was already plotting out his marriage like it was some cold business arrangement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, he was in his study, lounging back with a flashy little romance guidebook in his hands, staring at the pages as if they held the secrets of the universe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Erick walked in carrying a stack of documents,he nearly doubted his own eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe that his sharp, no-nonsense boss was actually reading a book like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to clear his throat to cover the laugh that was threatening to escape. &#34;Mr. Stewart, is there anything | can do for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even bother to look up. &#34;What could a single guy like you possibly know about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jab hit Erick right in the pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood there, silently licking his wounds, when he suddenly heard Nolan mutter under his breath, &#34;How do I make the proposal stand out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick blinked, then pushed aside his bruised ego and started thinking seriously. &#34;Well, Mr. Stewart, what matters most to Ms. Warren?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The answer that almost slipped out of Nolan&#39;s mouth was &#34;me.&#34; But he bit it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he said, &#34;The Hope House.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s eyes lit up as an idea struck him. &#34;Then why not propose there? Let the children join in. It would be meaningful, and she&#39;d never forget it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s entire expression shifted. Energy sparked in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The book was tossed onto the table in an instant, and he was already grabbing his car keys, striding toward the door with purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before leaving, he paused, turned back,and clapped Erick on the shoulder. &#34;This month, your salary&#39;s doubled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick was stunned, then practically glowed with excitement. It felt like he had been struck by fortune itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the next few days, Nolan&#39;s schedule changed.He was in and out constantly, leaving early and coming home late. Eleanor didn&#39;t think twice about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Nolan was probably just caught up in another round of heated clashes with Wray. Being busy was nothing new for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That afternoon, she had just finished sketching out a new design when her phone buzzed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Myah calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, the orphanage just got a huge donation of supplies from a charity. Can you come help me sort and count everything?&#34; Myah said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. I&#39;ll head over right now,&#34; Eleanor answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After ending the call, she picked up her bag and rushed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,she arrived at Hope House and pushed open the rusty iron gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she stepped inside, soft rose petals began to fall from above.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could process it, a little girl ran up to her, holding a single red rose in her tiny hand. She beamed as she held it out. &#34;Eleanor, this is for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor accepted the flower, still in a daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another child appeared. Then another.One after the other, they came running to her, each handing her a rose with the brightest smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms were slowly filled with roses, and her eyes began to sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was starting to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last child had skipped off, leaving her clutching a bouquet of roses, she saw Nolan standing at the far end of the path lined with petals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a perfectly fitted black suit, he was holding a diamond ring that sparkled brilliantly under the sunlight. His steps were solemn as he walked straight toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he stopped, lowered himself onto one knee,and looked up at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For once, the unshakable Nolan seemed nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,&#34; he began, his voice gentle but tinged with emotion, &#34;I love you. Will you marry me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could even respond, Eleanor caught sight of movement in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several familiar faces peeked out from behind a nearby tree-Hilda and Jeff, along with Lillian, Fannie,  Ryland,and Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone important to her was there, quietly witnessing the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart clenched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected Nolan to be this thoughtful, to bring all the people she cared about together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she wasn&#39;t ready to face Hilda and Jeff yet, a part of her still wanted her parents to be present on such an important day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tears spilled over as she nodded. &#34;Yes, I will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joy lit up Nolan&#39;s eyes as he slid the ring onto her finger with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he got up, swept her up into his arms,and carried her forward, the sound of laughter and cheers ringing out behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the villa in Regal Heights, their steps turned into whispers against the floor as Nolan laid Eleanor gently onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their lips found each other, breaths mingling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air grew heavy, almost electric, as if the world around them had disappeared. And just when the moment was about to tip over the edge,Nolan suddenly stopped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his forehead to hers, his voice coming out low and husky. &#34;Not yet. Let&#39;s save that for our wedding night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s chest heaved as she tried to calm her racing heart. Their passion subsided slowly, replaced by a quieter,deeper warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pressed a gentle kiss on Eleanor&#39;s forehead as he murmured, &#34;The Stewart Group is holding its hundredth anniversary next week. Will you come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her foggy thoughts cleared slightly at his words. She blinked, hesitant. &#34;Do you really think your grandfather will accept me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint laugh slipped from Nolan&#39;s lips. His thumb traced the outline of her mouth. &#34;You don&#39;t have to win him over. The only one you need to satisfy is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Eleanor rolled her eyes, though her lips curved despite herself. Somehow he always twisted the conversation to suit his own desires.</p>
