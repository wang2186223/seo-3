                <p>Eleanor hadn&#39;t imagined she would seek her out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of her building, she froze at the sight of a sleek Rolls-Royce idling at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ca door opened, and Hilda stepped out gracefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she reached for Eleanor&#39;s hand. Her own hands trembled as she held on tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My dear, you&#39;ve endured so much these days,&#34; Hilda murmured, her eyes shimmering with unspoken tenderness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp ache tugged at Eleanor&#39;s chest, and her nose stung with a sour burn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this what it felt like to be cared for by a mother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was gentle and warm, like being wrapped in a soft quilt on a cold night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this warmth was never truly meant for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing back her emotions, she gave Hilda&#39;s hand a light pat and steered the moment away. &#34;How have you been holding up lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda noticed theflicker of pain in her expression, and her own heart ached even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after carrying so many burdens, this child still thought of others first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone remain so kind through so much hardship?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a few light remarks about her health before carefully suggesting, &#34;It&#39;s already late, so why don&#39;t we find a place to sit down, have a meal, and talk a little?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s first instinct was to decline, but the hope shining in Hilda&#39;s eyes made her swallow the refusal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, the two of them were sitting insidea restaurant styled after Breoqua. The decor was tasteful, every detail carefully put together. Hilda ordered with ease, picking out several dishes she had once loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wondered if Eleanor might like them as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food was brought out quickly, and for a moment, Eleanor found herself dazed as she stared at the dishes laid out before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something oddly familiar about them, though she couldn&#39;t quite place why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a bite of a piece of sweet and sour spare rib.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The burst of tangy sweetness lit up her taste buds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was never the type to fuss about food or show strong preferences, yet this dish struck a note of comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes turned misty as she watched Eleanor enjoy it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this be a coincidence? Or something more?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, when Hilda was pregnant with her daughter, she could barely eat a thing. The only food she managed to stomach had been these very ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the pull of blood ties revealing itself in the smallest ways?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither woman spoke much as they ate, both lost in their own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just when the plates were nearly empty and the air between them was ready to shift into conversation,Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed against the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the anonymous text on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myah collapsed at the orphanage. Please come back quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breath caught. The moment she read the words, every muscle in her body went taut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no time to wonder who had sent it. She pushed back her chair in haste. &#34;Mrs. Benton, I&#39;m so sorry... something urgent came up. I need to leave now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda, alarmed by her sudden distress, stood up as well. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Myah fainted,&#34; Eleanor called over her shoulder as she hurried toward the door. &#34;I have to check on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, let Denny take you,&#34; Hilda quickly offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too worried to argue, Eleanor nodded and murmured her thanks before rushing out</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny was already moving after her, catching up easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching them go, Hilda finally let out the breath she had been holding. Her eyes moved to Eleanor&#39;s chair,and she felt relieved to see a strand of hair on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good. If it hadn&#39;t been there, she would have had to arrange another excuse to meet again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up carefully with a tissue and put it into her handbag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this, the truth would soon be revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,the Rolls-Royce raced down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the driver&#39;s seat, Denny kept glancing into the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he looked at Eleanor, the more he saw shadows of Hilda&#39;s younger self in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really be the person they had been searching for all this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the earlier DNA results gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had collected that hair sample himself; there had been no mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As his mind wrestled with questions, disaster struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of nowhere, a black truck shot out of a side street, moving far too fast, swerving as if it had no driver at all. It barreied straight toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Watch out!&#34; Denny shouted,pulling the wheel hard. But the truck was already too close, and the crash came with a violent bang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny slumped over the wheel, unresponsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain tore through Eleanor&#39;s body, her surroundings spinning wildly. Her vision blurred, fading fast, until everything slipped into darkness.</p>
