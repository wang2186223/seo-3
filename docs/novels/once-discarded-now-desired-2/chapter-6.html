                <p>Jonny&#39;s stare grew heavier, his silence darker than words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why so cold, gorgeous? Maybe a kiss will warm you up,&#34; the blond man teased, circling Eleanor like a predator who smelled blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s brow creased with disgust. &#34;Leave me alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I like my women with fight in them. The feistier,the better. Come on, let me show you a good time.&#34;His hand lunged brazenly toward her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold laugh slipped from Eleanor&#39;s lips as she snatched up an expensive bottle of red wine and smashed it hard against his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bottle shattered on impact, drenching the blond man&#39;s face in wine. &#34;Are you fucking kidding me!&#34; he yelled, smearing the liquid off his skin. &#34;You crazy bitch! Do you have any idea who I am? I&#39;m from the Murphy family.Tonight you&#39;ll be begging beneath me, I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire club froze, eyes snapping toward the chaos, eager to see how it would end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up on the third floor, behind a wide glass window,Ryland Brooks leaned back with narrowed eyes,amusement flickering across his face.&#34;Look at that-Brice Murphy really loves hearing himself talk,throwing around his family name like it means something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within Elepdon&#39;s upper circles, Brice was a nobody compared to the man seated across from Ryland-Nolan Stewart, heir to the Stewart family and head of Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, you&#39;ve been staring at that woman for a long time. Don&#39;t tell me she caught your interest?&#34; Ryland continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lazily swirling the wine in his glass, Nolan let his gaze linger on the woman draped in bright red.&#34;Yeah, she&#39;s really... interesting.&#34; Ryland&#39;s brow arched in surprise. &#34;That&#39;s unexpected. No woman has ever managed to draw your attention before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recalled faintly that the woman might even be a friend of his sister&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Brice, the blond man downstairs, had lost all composure, his rage threatening to ignite the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s face darkened as he sat brooding, then he suddenly rose to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &#34;Wait, Jonny, are you actually going to step in for Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind, Jonny? That woman brought this on herself by flirting with Brice.Why would you stick your neck out?&#34; Emma said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was my wife for three years. I won&#39;t stand here and pretend I don&#39;t know her,&#34; Jonny retorted, seizing a convenient justification for his actions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34; Emma started, but she faltered as two imposing figures descended the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes immediately shifted toward them, and the noise in the club died in an instant when people realized it was Nolan and Ryland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brice caught sight of them, and all arrogance drained from his face. He scrambled forward, practically bowing. &#34;Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, I had no idea you&#39;d be here tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone fawned as he continued, plastering on a fake smile, &#34;Allow me to cover the bill this evening.Please, enjoy yourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan dismissed him without so much as a glance,his gaze cutting past the crowd to settle firmly on Eleanor.</p>
