                <p>A cool breeze brushed Eleanor as she wandered along the quiet avenue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, her words had struck too sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora had been cautious, so it made sense Nolan hadn&#39;t believed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slowed her pace, waiting for him to catch up with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even after a long stretch, the street behind remained deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had chosen not to follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, ironic smile curved Eleanor&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps that was simply male nature: once desire was satisfied, attention faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had once loved her fiercely, Eleanor could sense it in every shared glance and touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,that devotion seemed to erode gradually, piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was no longer that woman, who would throw away her pride to try to win a man over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions could now flow freely without restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Nolan no longer wished to embrace her heart, she would release him completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Nolan gripped the steering wheel, a sudden ache tightening his chest as if a crucial part of him had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming it involved his grandfather, he pressed the accelerator hard and called Erick, instructing him to send reinforcements to the Stewart family&#39;s estate immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Racing through the city, he reached the aged villa within minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Nolan stepped inside, Colson&#39;s smug tone carried through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, you&#39;re aging. I&#39;m your true heir. Who else deserves your fortune? Just sign the papers. Nolan&#39;s occupied elsewhere. No reason to wait for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arrogance radiated from his words, coupled with an unshakable belief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ady had orchestrated the chaos perfectly, creating enough friction to distract Nolan and strain his bond with Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight belonged to him, a rare opportunity to seize control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson&#39;s confidence evaporated quickly. Nolan&#39;s mocking tone sliced through the room from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stepped forward, his presence sharp and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick flanked him, a line of impassive bodyguards following in precise formation, all dressed in black suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t he supposed to be away camping?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before any reaction formed, Erick motioned calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards immediately moved to encircle the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those bold moments ago-the members of the Stewart family and lawyer-now appeared frozen, dread etched across every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One old man, braver than his peers, wavered slightly, forcing a smile uglier than a grimace. &#34;Nolan, we...we were just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words stumbled as he searched for a justification that never arrived. Nolan&#39;s gaze passed the flustered man, landing on his grandfather, Norwood, who sat trembling with restrained fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A reassuring glance met Norwood s eyes before Nolan drifted to the sofa, sitting with effortless composure,legs crossed elegantly. Cold eyes swept the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should remember I am head of this family. Inheritance matters are serious, yet you didn&#39;t inform me?Who allowed such overreach?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The old man nearly crumpled under the weight of those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat trickled down his temple as he mumbled, &#34;It&#39;s a misunderstanding, Nolan! We heard Norwood was unwell and merely came to check on him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others nodded eagerly, seizing the chance to flee, practically tripping over themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, opposing Nolan directly for Colson&#39;s promised gain was far too dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Colson had assured them he would be absent tonight, which justified their presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now an excuse appeared-when else could they escape if not immediately?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic flashed across Colson&#39;s face as he looked toward Ady for direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gestured sharply to retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh, Dad, you and Nolan should rest,&#34; Colson said awkwardly. &#34;I&#39;ll visit later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed Ady and bolted, terrified Nolan&#39;s men would intercept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing them depart, Erick and the guards withdrew methodically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only grandfather and grandson remained in the silent room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood sank into.his chair, relief mingling with despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had he fathered such an ungrateful boy in this lifetime?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, Nolan stood by him, molded and raised through his guidance. Without the grandson, pride in his lineage would have vanished entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, Norwood focused on Nolan.&#34;You-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkness swept over him before words could finish, and he collapsed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan reacted instantly. He caught him in a rush and yelled toward the doorway. &#34;Hector, call 911!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector, stationed just outside, charged in. The moment he saw the scene, his face paled with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he fumbled for his phone, fingers trembling.</p>
