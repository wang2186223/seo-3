                <p>Jeff strode over to Jonny, his voice cutting through the air. &#34;Do you really think our place is some circus where anyone can barge in and create chaos?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years of being in charge lent his presence a weight that was impossible to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, that hardly mattered to Jonny right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma might have been a handful, but she was his little sister. He had looked out for her all his life.There was no way he could just let her vanish without demanding answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny brushed past Jeff, locking eyes with Lainey.His voice was raw, worn down by worry. &#34;Emma called you all the time before she went missing. You saw her the night she disappeared. She came home a wreck, wouldn&#39;t touch her dinner or even speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, can you honestly say you had nothing to do with her vanishing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stare never wavered, as if he could force the truth out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey,rattled, squirmed under his scrutiny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clung to Jeff&#39;s arm, her voice trembling, the very picture of innocence. &#34;Dad, I swear I don&#39;t know anything about what happened.Emma came to me a few days ago. She was desperate for money. She looked so lost that I gave her $100, 000, just to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his daughter in tears tore at Jeff&#39;s heart,snapping the last thread of his patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He signaled to the security guards by the entrance,his tone sharp and final. &#34;Get him out. I don&#39;t want Jonny Todd setting foot near this house again. If you can&#39;t handle that, you&#39;re out of a job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His order carried real menace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the tension, the head of security motioned for his team to close in on Jonny. But Jonny&#39;s attention never wavered from Lainey. His eyes held a mixture of disbelief and sorrow, as if the person standing in front of him was a complete stranger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two decades had passed with Jonny believing he understood Lainey better than anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A decade spent as her boyfriend had made him confident he knew every side of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Recent events shattered that certainty. The truth hit him hard-he had never truly seen her atall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He now recognized what he had missed. There was nothing but self-interest, cruelty, and lies beneath the surface. All this time, he had chosen to be blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, he realized, was worth ten of her, though she didn&#39;t come from an influential family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As these thoughts burned in his mind, the security team moved to escort him out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny stood his ground and kept his expression cold.He pinned Lainey with a glare sharp enough to cut. &#34;You&#39;ll be answering to the police about Emma. If you had anything to do with her going missing, you&#39;ll regret it more than you can imagine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only those with nothing left were fearless-he would take Lainey down with him if it came to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards led him away, and Jonny left without protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of this played out beneath Hilda&#39;s watchful gaze from upstairs. She pieced things together as she watched the confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That must have been Emma arguing with Lainey before-now Emma had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given that Lainey had hid behind Jeff, looking shaken and guilty, Hilda&#39;s suspicions only grew stronger.Deep down, she was certain-Lainey was involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything Hilda believed about Lainey fell apart in a matter of moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deception and greed were only part of what lay beneath the surface; a cold streak of cruelty was there as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The years of tension between Lainey and Eleanor suddenly seemed more threatening. If Lainey could turn on her so easily, what might she be capable of next?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Directly confronting her would be pointless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hilda wanted to protect Eleanor, she needed to keep up appearances and watch Lainey closely for any signs of danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mind made up, Hilda descended the stairs.As Lainey entered, Hilda wrapped her in an embrace,offering warmth she had never shown before.&#34;Darling, that man was never good enough for you.I&#39;m sorry for all you&#39;ve been through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence blossomed inside Lainey as she believed Hilda finally trusted her after those test results.Victory felt almost sweet enough to taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned into the embrace and played the dutiful daughter. &#34;Mom, having you and Dad back in my life  everything worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone glancing in would have seen nothing but a picture-perfect family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff took in the scene with deep contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, it seemed, Hilda had accepted Lainey completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The prospect of all three sons returning from overseas only added to his satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,their family would feel whole again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor resembled his wife, yes, but blood didn&#39;t lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, once they made it back to Breoqua,he would speak to Hilda&#39;s brother about Eleanor. If there wvas a reunion to be had, it was up to them to decide.</p>
