                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze was soft, filled with unwavering warmth as if he was promising Eleanor,&#34;The tiara will be yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of envy twisted across Lainey&#39;s face,her eyes darkening with disbelief. &#34;No way! How on earth did she come up with that much cash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even knowing Eleanor was Enigma didn&#39;t make sense of it. She couldn&#39;t have managed that kind of money on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Nolan secretly give it to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,that couldn&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan might be rich, but he wasn&#39;t reckless enough to throw a fortune at someone he had just started dating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Lainey didn&#39;t realize wasthat one day soon,Nolan would be willing to give up every cent he owned just to put a smile on Eleanor&#39;s face. That,however, was a Chapter yet to unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For now, Eleanor sat unfazed by the doubters and let a small, confident smile play on her lips. She stood up, handed a card over to the auctioneer,and said in a clear, steady voice, &#34;Feel free to check the balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning widely, the auctioneer accepted the card and motioned for one of the staff members to handle it.&#34;Let&#39;s get this confirmed right away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>WVhile they waited, Lainey&#39;s expression remained glued to Eleanor, her excitement barely contained as if she expected to watch Eleanor&#39;s bank account be exposed for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her arms and scoffed, &#34;Some people just can&#39;t help pretending to have what they don&#39;t! I can&#39;t wait for her to slip up, then we&#39;ll see what happens-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden, icy stare sent a shiver down her spine before she could get the rest of her sentence out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, she turned around and found herself staring into Nolan&#39;s unreadable eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It rattled her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, she clamped her mouth shut and stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a staff member hurried back, waving the card. His voice shook with excitement as he handed it back to Eleanor and announced, &#34;After checking,Miss Warren&#39;s balance exceeds ten billion. She&#39;s fully cleared to pay for the tiara.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten billion-an amount that left everyone stunned!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides Nolan, nobody else in the room seemed to hold that kind of financial firepower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question buzzed in everyone&#39;s mind: Who exactly was Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there more to her than just being Enigma?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the crowd whispered among themselves,Eleanor effortlessly won the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara,placing the opening bid of one hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had braced herself for a bidding war, but to her surprise, no one else joined in to bid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey tried to stir up trouble, but Jonny grabbed her arm and kept her in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of relief washed over Eleanor as she became the new owner of the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, she knew she had honored her mentor&#39;s wish. Another priceless artifact had finally found its way home. Nolan watched the joy on her face and moved a little closer. &#34;If there&#39;s ever anything you want, just say the word. I&#39;ll make sure you get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor carefully set the tiara to the side, then fixed her eyes on him. &#34;Do you really mean that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of worry tugged at her as she wondered if he even realized how much she was asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking on this mission meant pitting her own determination to stand firm against powerful financial interests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Put simply, no amount of money was enough, no matter how much one had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could only push forward with everything she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Nolan chose to support her, doors to treasures she could never reach alone might finally open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was he truly willing to take that step with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in the way Nolan held her gaze told her he understood exactly what she needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t looking for something ordinary, and he knew it. Still, he didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes traced her features, lingering on her lips. &#34;Yes,I meant what I said.&#34; He then leaned in and pressed a soft, fleeting kiss to her lips, as if sealing a vow between them. &#34;Everything I have is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief moment,Eleanor found herself completely swept up by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he always seem to know the right thing to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although their time together had been brief, he had a way of making her feel as if she were the center of his entire world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor found herself at a loss, unwilling to chase the thought any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To hide her flustered state, she sprang to her feet.&#34;I got what I wanted, so we should head out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan could immediately tell that she was being shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing to let her off the hook, he held back any playful remarks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just offered a gentle nod and quietly walked out with her.</p>
