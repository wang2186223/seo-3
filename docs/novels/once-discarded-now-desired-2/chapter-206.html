                <p>Norwood was comfortably seated in the Stewart family&#39;s residence&#39;s living room, chatting animatedly with Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thanks to Lainey&#39;s nonstop scheming, the conversation had once again shifted to Nolan&#39;s marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, driven by a fierce desire to secure the perfect match for his daughter, slid a multi-billion-dollar contract across the table for Norwood to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face lit up. He even leaned forward to pour Jeff a cup of coffee himself. &#34;If our families were united by marriage, it would be a legendary alliance,&#34; he said, beaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contract meant the Stewarts could finally break into the Breoqua market. Not only would they cement their status as the richest family in the country, but they could also set their sights on becoming a global powerhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Lainey? Well, aside from her occasional arrogance and sharp edge, she was hardly a concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Nolan married her, and she would fit neatly into the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, though trying to maintain composure, couldn&#39;t hide his pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised his cup and said with a sincere smile,&#34;You&#39;re right, Mr. Stewart. She would be lucky to have your grandson as her husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she heard that, Lainey pretended to be shy and lowered her eyes, though the smile spreading across her face betrayed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it. She was about to be Nolan&#39;s wife!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, that annoying woman, was probably somewhere suffering right now. Suddenly, the front doors swung open, and Nolan stepped in, radiating a chilling intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s heart skipped a beat. She quickly straightened, plastering on what she thought was her most charming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, you-&#34; she started, but the words died in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dozen bodyguards moved in perfect unison behind him, filling the living room and blocking all possible exits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey froze, her smile locked and lifeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood slammed his coffee cup onto the table, the sound cutting through the tension like a whip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you,Nolan!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s face tightened with concern. &#34;Nolan,what is al this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes swept the room like ice, taking in Lainey, Jeff, and Norwood in a single glance. They were all conveniently together, sparing him the hassle of going to each one separately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pressed his lips together and subtly signaled the bodyguards, who immediately understood, and without a word, half of them fanned out to conduct a thorough search of the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The entire place quickly turned into a coordinated operation, like a full-blown raid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s finger shook as he jabbed toward Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff wore a dark, grim expression, sensing the gravity of the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, the bodyguards came back and bowed to Nolan. &#34;Mr. Stewart, we can&#39;t find Miss Warren,&#34; one reported.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood finally realized what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl had vanished, and his own grandson was convinced he had taken her, storming in ready to exact revenge! The truth hit him like a hammer to the chest, stealing his breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bastard! Get your people and leave now!&#34;Norwood barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan remained unmoved, his gaze sharp and unyielding. Instead of replying, he fired back,&#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t a question but a command, loaded with authority and danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood struggled to contain his anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his disdain for Eleanor, considering her beneath the Stewart name, he would never stoop so low as to kidnap her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such an act would tarnish the family&#39;s honor, and that was something he could never allow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When.he noticed that Norwood&#39;s face showed no trace of lies, Nolan&#39;s gaze shifted to Jeff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intensity in his eyes was enough to send a shiver  down Jeff&#39;s spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My men are on their way to your residence,&#34; Nolan said calmly, as if he were discussing the weather.&#34;Let me make this clear. If this has anything to do with the Benton family-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice dropped, and his eyes flashed toward Lainey, whose face had turned ghostly pale. &#34;I will make sure you pay for it. Endlessly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s blood ran cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t anticipated that Nolan would go to such extremes for Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deadly intent in his eyes was terrifyingly real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would not hesitate to act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how scared his daughter appeared, Jeff was ready to explode with anger, but a strange worry about Eleanor&#39;s disappearance gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the tension reached its peak, a panicked voice called out as someone hurried in. &#34;Nolan! Take it easy!&#34;</p>
