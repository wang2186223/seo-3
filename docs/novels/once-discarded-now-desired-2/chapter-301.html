                <p>Eleanor froze the moment she saw the scene before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on that familiar face, and for a moment,her mind went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had told her he was busy with something urgent.Was this what he had meant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to question his loyalty, yet her fingers tightened around Lillian&#39;s hand, as if clinging to it could steady her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan met her gaze without flinching. His voice was calm, not a trace of hesitation. &#34;Eleanor, this is Elora Guyton.My mother adopted her years ago. She&#39;s like a sister to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora stepped forward cheerfully, her smile soft and harmless, her tone sweet. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you,Eleanor. I&#39;m Elora. I&#39;ve heard so much about you, and you&#39;re even more beautiful than I imagined! Nolan kept you hidden from me all this time.Finally,I get to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them showed no unease, as though nothing was out of place. Still, Eleanor couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that Elora wasn&#39;t as simple as she appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing down her doubts, she reached out and shook Elora&#39;s hand. &#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too,Elora.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s eyes lit up as she gave a warm invitation.&#34;Are you here for dinner as well? Why don&#39;t you join us?The more, the merrier. I&#39;ve been with Nolan and Fannie these days, and honestly, I&#39;m getting a little bored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s chest tightened at those words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was Nolan&#39;s urgent matter-keeping Elora company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jumble of emotions weighed her down, leaving her breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,looking at Elora&#39;s innocent smile, she wondered if she was simply imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She steadied herself, masking her feelings behind her usual coolness. &#34;No, thank you. My friend is drunk.I need to take her home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she helped Lillian up and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in Nolan panicked as he watched her go.He hurried after her. &#34;Let me help you.&#34; He took the drunken Lillian from Eleanor&#39;s arms and supported her firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing back at Elora with apology in his eyes, he said, &#34;Elora, I&#39;m sorry to leave you alone. I&#39;ll have a driver pick you up later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora waved it off with a knowing smile. &#34;It&#39;s fine.Home isn&#39;t far. I&#39;ll just grab a taxi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a short nod,then left with Eleanor,guiding Lillian out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They dropped Lillian at her house, and soon only the two of them remained in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence filled the ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor leaned against the window, watching the world outside, unwilling to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hated feeling that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if her man no longer belonged to her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s grip tightened on the steering wheel. He wanted to explain,but each time the words rose to his lips, he didn&#39;t know how to begin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time he stopped at the Benton family&#39;s villa,Eleanor felt a twinge of disappointment. She unfastened her seatbelt, her face unreadable &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was flat, stripped of warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the door, ready to leave, when Nolan suddenly caught her wrist and pulled her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, wrapping her firmly in his arms</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin rested on her head, his voice low and rough.&#34;Are you upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze, his clean scent softening her heart,though she forced herself to answer, &#34;I&#39;m not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sighed and tightened his embrace. His hand stroked her hair gently. &#34;Eleanor, I&#39;m sorry for making you feel neglected. Elora is just like a sister. Once things settle, I&#39;ll make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nestled in his arms, Eleanor gave him a light pinch in playful punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The couple stayed wrapped in each other, their closeness pulling them toward something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as their lips were about to meet, Elora&#39;s call shattered the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, help! He&#39;s back in the country.He&#39;s following me! I&#39;m terrified-&#34; Her voice cut off with sudden chaos on the other end,followed by silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression darkened in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear for Elora left him no choice. After giving Eleanor a brief explanation, he said, &#34;Eleanor, I&#39;m sorry,but have to find her.&#34;</p>
