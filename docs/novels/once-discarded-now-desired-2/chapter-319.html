                <p>After leaving the hospital, Eleanor returned home just long enough to pack a few essentials before heading straight to join the temporary project team Dyer had put together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped out of a taxi, Dyer nearly froze in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The location was pretty isolated. Nolan hadn&#39;t come to escort her, nor had he arranged a driver. This felt like too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors of a falling out between them had been circulating, and now seeing her arrive unaccompanied made him wonder if the gossip was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Dyer didn&#39;t have time to linger on speculation. The auction was just around the corner, and with so much to do and little time left, their focus had to be on getting everything ready for tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing histhroat, he called the team together. &#34;The artifacts returning from overseas are arriving soon.I want every one of you focused-no excuses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned his gaze toward Eleanor, pride and trust mixed in his expression. &#34;Eleanor, you&#39;ll lead the documentation team. Make sure everyone has the reference materials they need, and double-check every detail. Nothing should be overlooked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded promptly, standing tall and confident before her team. She made sure everyone understood their responsibilities and got straight to work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team threw themselves into the tasks, working tirelessly through the day and far into the night. Most of them even stayed overnight at the project site, determined to finish preparations for the artifacts before the auction began.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stayed alongside them, completely immersed in her work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, her phone lay abandoned in the locker room, ringing endlessly untiI its battery finally gave out. At Nightfall, Nolan sat alone in a dimly lit room on the top floor, staring at his phone as if willing it to connect.He tugged at his tie and downed the whiskey in front of him in one hard gulp, frustration pressing down on him like a weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had made nearly a hundred calls over the course of the day, each one going straight to voicemail or failing to connect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like yelling into an empty void, powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really about to lose Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t done anything wrong. So why had everything gone off course?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Ryland appeared beside him, swirling his own glass lazily. &#34;Still haven&#39;t patched things up with Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t answer and simply poured himself another drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland clicked his tongue and shook his head. &#34;Have you even thought about why it got this bad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Nolan set down his glass, his gaze sharpening into steel as he looked up. &#34;Cut the nonsense, Ryland.Just tell me what you&#39;re getting at.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland set his drink down, adopting a serious tone that was rare for him. &#34;I just can&#39;t ignore how suspicious it is... Ever since Eloracame back, things between you and Eleanor started going downhill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan opened his mouth to respond, but Ryland continued, analyzing the situation. &#34;I get it. Elora&#39;s been through a lot, she&#39;s vulnerable and needs support. But don&#39;t you see? The timing of her showing up lines up almost perfectly with when you upset Eleanor. It&#39;s hard to ignore the connection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s jaw tightened, understanding where Ryland&#39;s suspicion was coming from, but he wasn&#39;t willing to accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve known Elora since we were kids,&#34; Nolan said firmly. &#34;I know her better than you ever will. She&#39;s just come out of a rough patch and nearly lost everything. Don&#39;t jump to conclusions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could still see it all. The fear in her eyes, the trembling in her voice, the heartbreak she carried. That pain was real. He had witnessed it firsthand. It couldn&#39;t be false.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, suspicion wasn&#39;t just coming from his grandfather, but now Ryland was also overanalyzing everything,adding fuel to a fire that didn&#39;t exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s circumstances were pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her life had been filled with struggle and loss. As her childhood friend, he owed her his support and protection. If he doubted her, how could she ever feel safe moving forward?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland exhaled and raised his hands in surrender. &#34;Alright, alright. I get it. My bad. I shouldn&#39;t have doubted your innocent little Elora. I was wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to convince this stubborn man of reason was like talking to a brick wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Love really could make a man blind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland leaned closer, changing the subject with a mischievous &#39;glint in his eye. &#34;Forget arguing now. Your real priority now is winning Eleanor back. You&#39;re going to the auction tomorrow, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave Nolan a cheeky wink. &#34;Be thoughtful, pay attention, and maybe pick up a few pieces she&#39;d like.With her personality, a little gesture like that could melt her defenses in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s fingers drummed against the rim of his glass, tracing its edges absentmindedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland&#39;s advice made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arguing about who was right or wrong wasn&#39;t going to fix anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had to show Eleanor, in every way he could, that she was the only one who mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drained the rest of his drink, set the glass down with quiet resolve, and finally spoke. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll go tomorrow.&#34;</p>
