                <p>Wray was fuming with anger, and Trudy wasn&#39;t in a much better mood herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt tense and uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s stance wasn&#39;t as steady as it had been before. He could pull the plug on the engagement at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t just sit there and wait for it to happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to prove herself-not just to the Stewart family, but to everyone watching. She needed to show that her worth went far beyond the White Group. Marrying her would be the smartest move the Stewarts could make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting her lip in thought, she stared ahead for a moment before her expression hardened. Finally, she gave the driver a sharp order. &#34;Turn the car around.  Head to my grandparents&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile,Eleanor had no idea any of this was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Enigma store&#39;s grand opening stretched late into the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the day ended, sales had astonishingly surpassed ten million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every penny would soon be donated to Elepdon Welfare Center under the names of the customers,promising a brighter future for countless children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plans were already taking shape to establish multiple orphanages, reaching even more homeless kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s eyes sparkled with excitement. She grabbed Eleanor&#39;s hand and practically pulled her along.&#34;Eleanor, come on! We have to celebrate. I know the perfect spot. The Crown Club has tons of good-looking guys lately. Trust me, it&#39;ll be amazing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help smiling at Lillian&#39;s excitement.  Just as she was about to respond, a familiar figure caught her attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was leaning casually against a black Bentley, his tailored suit emphasizing his tall, commanding presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streetlight cast a long shadow behind him,and he watched her silently, like a loyal companion patiently waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian followed Eleanor&#39;s eyes and saw him, and her smile immediately faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he heard everything she just said?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic overtook her. She quickly raised a hand to her forehead,faking dizziness. &#34;Eleanor, I feel a little faint all of a sudden. Maybe I overdid it today. I should head home.Have fun,okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could answer, Lillian bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor chuckled softly, shaking her head. Typical  Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the way, wasn&#39;t Erick supposed to pick herup?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, Nolan had taken his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over smoothly, opened the car door for her with quiet courtesy, and Eleanor leaned in gracefully to get inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was calm, the only sound their soft breaths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was about to start talking about the day&#39;s amazing opening when Nolan suddenly leaned close,capturing her in a firm, possessive kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their lips met, and the small space around them seemed to hum with heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Nolan finally pulled away, Eleanor was nearly breathless. He lingered, reluctant to let go, his fingertips brushing her swollen, red lips.His gaze burned into hers. &#34;Eleanor, where did Lillian say she wanted to take you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy radiated from him in every word. Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but laugh inwardly but kept her expression sweet and innocent. &#34;Oh, we didn&#39;t go anywhere. You&#39;re the only one I care about. I like you the most. Let&#39;s go back to my apartment. I&#39;m starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached out and gently ruffled his hair,a tender gesture that calmed him instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lips curved into a satisfied smile. He settled back into his seat and started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a red light, he pulled out his phone and sent a quick message to Ryland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Keep an eye on your sister. Don&#39;t let her lead Eleanor astray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far away, Ryland stared at the message, utterly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had Lillian done this time to earn Nolan&#39;s wrath?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked up at the sky and let out a long,resigned sigh. Ever since Nolan and Eleanor had gotten together,life for him and his sister had been anything but easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why had they done to deserve this?</p>
