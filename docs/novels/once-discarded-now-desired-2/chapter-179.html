                <p>Someone was dragged out in a hurry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser narrowed his eyes and recognized the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jonny, the head of Todd Group. He used to be married to Eleanor. Now, he was Lainey&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser had already heard whispers about him while he was staying in Breoqua. Lainey planned to leave Jonny because he mistreated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wondered if Eleanor had gone through the same thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The possibility chilled Fraser. His gaze hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jonny had no idea he was not welcome there. He fought against the head of security and shouted threats at him. &#34;You idiot better let me go! Do you even know who you&#39;re dealing with? I&#39;m Lainey&#39;s husband, and I run the Todd Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The head of security did not even flinch at his outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser made his way down the steps, pausing right in front of Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression was cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses. &#34;Is it true you hit Lainey?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny lifted his eyes and caught sight of a man whose features carried a trace of Hilda&#39;s likeness. At.once,he realized it was Fraser. Hlis resistance faded, and his face lit up with joy. &#34;You&#39;re Lainey&#39;s brother, right?Fraser, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m Jonny Todd!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eager to clear his name, he rushed to explain, eyes wide and voice pleading. &#34;No, you have to believe me.1never laid a hand on her. You can ask my ex-wife; we were married for three years, and I never laid a hand on her. I haven&#39;t even been with Lainey that long. There&#39;s no way I would have hit her. Lainey just got mad at me and twisted the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting any time, Jonny blurted out what he wanted. &#34;Fraser, I want to see Lainey.I need to talk to her, even if it&#39;s just for a minute. Please. I won&#39;t cause any trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hearing Jonny&#39;s request, Fraser could not be bothered to keep talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned icy, cutting the conversation short with a look at security. &#34;Get him out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, Mr. Benton.&#34; The head of security stepped forward, pulling Jonny away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The harshness caught Jonny off guard. He shot Fraser a bitter glare, his words turning venomous. &#34;Your family really is heartless! None of you understands Lainey at all!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser paused for just a second as he started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing an.opening, Jonny yelled louder, voice cracking with desperation, &#34;Lainey&#39;s the problem, not me! l wouldn&#39;t be in this mess if it weren&#39;t for her! Let me in and I&#39;Il tell you everything about what she&#39;s done!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Fraser would let Jonny in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t about defending Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton family never welcomed just anyone ito their home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a simple gesture, Fraser signaled for the head of security to keep going, and the latter tightened his grip,hauling Jonny toward the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he realized Fraser would not budge, Jonny&#39;s frustration boiled over. &#34;You&#39;ll regret this! Every one of you will!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rant faded into the distance as the heavy iron gate closed with a final, echoing thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A haze of smoke curled around Fraser as he settled into the old gazebo and lit a cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with all he knew about Lainey&#39;s sharp edges, Jonny&#39;s accusations suggested there was a hidden side to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed Lainey was a hell of a lot more than mnet the eye. He pulled out his phone and dialed his assistant, voice steady but urgent. &#34;Dig into everything about Lainey&#39;s time overseas. I want a full report, down to the smallest detail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, Mr. Benton.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had already looked into her life here. Other than the possibility she was impersonating his sister and an attitude that bordered on arrogant, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was that stretch of time she spent abroad. She didn&#39;t seem to be the type to devote herself to her studies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had gotten into something she shouldn&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed proof.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more dirt he had on Lainey, the easier it would be to convince his father that she wasn&#39;t their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, as long as his father felt anything for her, he might always keep her close, even if it turned out she was never really his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would never allow that.</p>
