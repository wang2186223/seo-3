                <p>Eleanor lingered in the warm embrace of the hot spring,her anticipation for Nolan&#39;s return growing with each passing minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brisk mountain breeze swept through, its chill biting at her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shivered, caught in the night&#39;s icy grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was Nolan delayed for so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A creeping unease stirred within her, swelling with every moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she couldn&#39;t wait any longer. She had to find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from the steaming waters, Eleanor wrapped herself in a plush towel and hastened toward their room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she neared the door, she froze at the sight of Trudy,disheveled and frantic, pounding desperately on the wood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Trudy doing here? A jolt of dread surged through Eleanor, a sinking feeling that something terrible had befallen Nolan. Trudy&#39;s eyes locked onto Eleanor&#39;s, and she lunged forward like a woman possessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, you&#39;ve ruined everything!&#34; she shrieked,her voice raw with venom. &#34;If it weren&#39;t for you, I would have had my way by now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s words painted a grim picture, and Eleanor&#39;s gaze hardened, her heart icing over with resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring Trudy&#39;s tirade, she strode to the door and hammered on it with urgency. &#34;Nolan, it&#39;s me!&#34; she called, her voice steady but pleading. &#34;Eleanor! Nolan,please,open the door!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, only an oppressive silence answered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, a cloying, seductive scent drifted from beneath the door, curling into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s senses sharpened as she recognized the dangerous scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was an aphrodisiac, potent and intoxicating,capable of dire consequences if not countered swiftly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Eleanor dialed the hotel reception,her voice sharp with urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hotel manager, upon learning the situation,seized the master key and hurried toward the room, panic quickening his steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door swung open, Eleanor darted inside, slamming it shut and locking it from the inside before the manager or Trudy could follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside,the manager stood perplexed in the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should he stick around... or just get the hell out of there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Trudy, now slumped on the floor,hurling curses with the ferocity of a cornered animal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clear she wasn&#39;t a registered guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a furrowed brow, he summoned security guards.&#34;Remove this disruptor,&#34; he ordered firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the room was thick with the sickly-sweet scent,so overpowering it turned Eleanor&#39;s stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes fell on a shattered scented candle, dried bloodstains on the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Nolan injured?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart constricted with fear. The sound of rushing water drew her to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a moment&#39;s pause, Eleanor rushed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, Nolan sat slumped against the cold tiled wall,the shower&#39;s icy cascade drenching him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His skin bore an unnatural flush, veins pulsing at his temples, muscles taut with the effort of resisting the drug&#39;s grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most arresting of all was the ghastly gash on Nolan&#39;s arm, a deep wound exposing bone beneath torn flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood swirled with the water, a relentless crimson stream spiraling down the drain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as before, he had chosen to wound himself rather than betray her with another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears, her vision blurring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to his side and knelt beside him, her heart pounding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, are you all right?&#34; Her voice quivered as she reached out, her fingers trembling as they assessed his state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, eyes clenched shut in a battle for control,stirred at the sound of her voice. His lids fluttered open, revealing irises ablaze with a feverish, chaotic hunger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that fleeting moment, Nolan&#39;s restraint shattered With a desperate surge, he drew Eleanor into his arms,his lips, searing with unspoken longing, capturing hers in a fierce, consuming kiss.</p>
