                <p>With Horace stepping in and covering things up,Eleanor didn&#39;t manage to pin down any hard proof against Lainey, even after wrapping up her work in Otrad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not that it mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew in her gut Lainey was behind it,and that was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evidence could wait. She had all the time in the world to deal with her when the moment was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the last artifact sealed and handed over,Eleanor finally straightened her back, groaning at the stiffness that came from days of near-constant work underground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been pushing herself without rest just to make the deadline. Her phone had been shut off that whole time too, her own doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally powered it back on, a flood of notifications nearly overwhelmed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of them were from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant his familiar profile picture popped up, her heart gave a little jolt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened the chat and started scrolling through the messages, one after another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t forget to reply when you get this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your signal acting up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last one was from late last night. It read, &#34;I miss you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened. She could almost still feel the warmth of his kiss on her forehead, and those words hit her like a slow burn searing into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt settled in heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t the type to reach out easily,yet here he was, sending her message after message, waiting in silence for a reply that never came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could imagine the letdown he must have felt every time her silence greeted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s grip on the phone tightened as she started typing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I just saw this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the words, then backspaced. Too flat.Too dismissive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then typed another reply. &#34;I didn&#39;t have signal here. I wasn&#39;t avoiding you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Delete. That sounded like an excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rewrote and erased again. Nothing sounded right; everything came out too light, too shallow,never close to what she truly wanted to say. In the end, she settled on something short but certain. &#34;I&#39;m coming back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding the phone back into her pocket, she headed straight for her tent, packed up her things, and made her way to the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, when she finally stepped off the plane in Elepdon, the first thing she spotted was Nolan&#39;s ridiculously handsome face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her footsteps faltered without her meaning to, and before she could even collect herself, Nolan was already striding over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without saying a word, he caught her wrist and steered her straight toward the Bentley parked outside the terminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second the door shut behind them, he pulled her into a kiss that left her breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tried to shove at his chest, muttering against his lips, &#34;Someone might see...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when her eyes flicked forward, she noticed the partition had been raised, sealing them off from the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the sudden suspicion this whole thing was no spur-of-the-moment act-he had thought it through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ever since their first kiss, it was like Nolan had flipped a switch inside himself-unstoppable,relentless, like he had been holding back for far too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he knew just when to ease off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After stealing a few deep kisses, he finally let her go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sat up quickly, smoothing her hair and forcing a calm expression. &#34;From now on, no kissing me in public.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t look the least bit sorry; instead, his lips curved in a slow smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned in, pressing his forehead lightly to hers, his breath warm as he murmured, &#34;So what you&#39;re saying is that I&#39;m allowed to kiss you at home?&#34; Without thinking, she blurted, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own answer hit her a second later. She had walked right into that one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered, she clenched her teeth and shot him a glare. &#34;Either way, you still need my permission first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan only chuckled softly, watching her sulky expression with clear amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed his fingers across her lips and whispered in a tone that promised more, &#34;Okay. Whatever you say.&#34;</p>
