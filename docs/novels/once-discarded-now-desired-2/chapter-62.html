                <p>Thirty minutes later, Lainey breezed into the Todd family&#39;s home, the signed contract clutched in her hand, and her mood soaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was eager to tell Jonny the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she dazzled everyone at the wedding, it would make him look good,too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surely, he would be thrilled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the moment she entered the living room, a completely different scene awaited her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp crash echoed as a glass shattered right at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey! Where did all that money go?&#34; Jonny&#39;s eyes burned with fury, and for a moment, he looked ready to explode. Lainey instinctively backed away, shock and hurt flickering across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really lashing out at her over ten million?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the time came to turn her back on the Todd Group, she wouldn&#39;t hesitate because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But until then, she would play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she regained her composure, she lifted her head,tears rolling down her cheeks. &#34;Jonny, all I did was order a wedding gown from Enigma. I just wanted us to have a perfect wedding. You know how long I&#39;ve dreamed of marrying you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Jonny would always give in whenever she decided to turn on the charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But ten million wasn&#39;t a small sum! That was a massive amount!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jumped through hoops, begged contacts, and scraped together investments. Even with the help of  several smaller firms, he hadn&#39;t managed to raise that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she spent it in the blink of an eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she be so reckless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each passing second, Jonny&#39;s frustration grew.His words came out colder than ever. &#34;Lainey, do you have any idea what kind of mess the Todd Group is in right now? You&#39;re well aware we&#39;re struggling to keep the company afloat, and yet you chose to blow a fortune on a wvedding gown?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor was still around, she never wasted money like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her wardrobe was simple, her lifestyle modest, and she rarely splurged on expensive jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used to mock her for not fitting in with high society.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he was starting to see that Eleanor had always managed the household wisely and genuinely cared about the Todd family&#39;s well-being! Unlike Lainey, who only knew how to spend!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Jonny fume, Lainey felt her nerves panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never expected him to lose his temper so completely over ten million, especially after everything they had been through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, if this plan didn&#39;t work, she would just have to try something else. Unlike Eleanor, who lacked elegance and education, she knew exactly how to get her way whenever she needed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on an anxious act, she reached out and gripped Jonny&#39;s hand tightly. &#34;Jonny, please forgive me. I didn&#39;t mean to mess up. Please don&#39;t be mad at me...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down her face again, as though she had been deeply wronged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a moment, then pressed on, &#34;But everything I did was for you and your family! You have no idea what happened at the banquet. The moment I mnentioned that I&#39;d ordered a dress from Enigma, all those usually arrogant socialites suddenly warmed up to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She locked eyes with Jonny. &#34;You know how much everyone in Elepdon&#39;s upper class adores Enigma.Every socialite and aristocrat in town craves elegance, and none of them would pass up the chance to be linked with Enigma. Once I walk down the aisle in that gown, they&#39;ll all want to connect with me! These relationships could end up being a huge advantage for the Todd Group down the line!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck a chord with Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd Group never had a shortage of promising projects-what they lacked were reliable investors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Should Lainey&#39;s new contacts turn into financial backers, the Todd Group would finally be safe from the Stewart Group&#39;s looming threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That realization softened Jonny&#39;s features. He reached out and drew her into his arms, all traces of anger gone. &#34;Lainey, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t have snapped at you like tat. Please forgive me.&#34; Of course, Lainey still felt wounded, but she kept it hidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned into his chest, speaking softly and sweetly. &#34;It&#39;s fine, Jonny. As long as you know how much I care about us, that&#39;s all I need.&#34;</p>
