                <p>Out of nowhere, Nolan appeared, his fist landing squarely on Jonny&#39;s jaw. Jonny stumbled and hit the floor hard,caught completely off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan turned immediately to Eleanor, his eyes softening.&#34;Are you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still stunned, she nodded. &#34;I... I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her thoughts were a mess. Lillian had told her Nolan was abroad, so why was he here now? Had Lillian lied?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could sort through it, Jonny pushed himself back up, blood smearing at the corner of his mouth.His glare was venomous. &#34;Mr. Stewart, I was only dealing with my ex-wife. Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re overstepping?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan gave a short, icy laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched down until he was eye-to-eye with Jonny, his voice low and deliberate. &#34;You&#39;re her ex-husband. And I&#39;m her current...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped there, leaving the final word unspoken, though his meaning was clear. Eleanor would be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s bravado collapsed under Nolan&#39;s suffocating presence. He bit back any retort, swallowing his anger, though hatred simmered in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swore silently that one day, he would make Nolan pay for this humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan wouldn&#39;t have cared, even if he knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Todd Group could never match Stewart Group&#39;s power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor, flustered by the tension, used the chance to quietly slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found Lillian just as the party wound down. Sallie never showed her face all evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was supposed to be her birthday ended up feeling like Lainey&#39;s stage instead, giving the guess plenty to whisper about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guests murmured that Sallie clearly despised Lainey if she couldn&#39;t even fake civility for her birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had no interest in the chatter. She tugged Lillian toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing she wanted was another run-in with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer she stayed, the riskier it felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But fate had other plans. Nolan was already waiting by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, quick to sense an opportunity, excused herself at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick also drifted aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was left alone with Nolan, unsure of what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a stiff smile. &#34;Nolan, thanks for earlier. I have something to take care of, so I&#39;ll be going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,Nolan didn&#39;t budge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he leaned in, eyes locked on hers, his tone low and persuasive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a permanent solution for your ex-husband problem.Do you want to hear it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instincts screamed to refuse, but before she could get a word out, he closed the gap further, his breath grazing her ear as he murmured, &#34;Be my girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart lurched.What kind of outrageous proposal was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blurted out immediately, &#34;Thank you, but I&#39;m not looking for a relationship.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, unfazed, gave a calm reply. &#34;Then I&#39;ll just move to Plan B.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A chill prickled down her spine. Almost on cue, her phone buzzed. Heart sinking, she glanced at the screen, and there it was, on her WhatsApp, in bold letters: &#34;Daily question: When will Eleanor agree to be my girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face flushed with horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he seriously putting her on the spot like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept staring at the screen, utterly mortified.</p>
