                <p>At the villa in Regal Heights, Eleanor was sitting on the soft wool carpet, carefully selecting her engagement dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had initially wanted to design it herself, but Nolan had put his foot down, insisting she leave it to the designer he had paid so she wouldn&#39;t wear herself out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lingered on a mermaid-style gown dotted with tiny diamonds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elegant,understated, exactly her taste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded in satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to try it on when Lillian burst in like a whirlwind, dressed in a fiery red outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tossed her limited-edition handbag onto the sofa and marched straight toward Eleanor, hands planted firmly on her hips, glaring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; she barked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An engagement this big, and you didn&#39;t even bother to clue me in! If my brother hadn&#39;t spilled the beans, I  would still be in the dark.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help but laugh at her friend&#39;s dramatic entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood, strolled over to the bar, and poured a cup of coffee, offering it to Lillian with a small smile.&#34;My bad. I planned to tell everyone once things were settled,&#34; she said, handing over the cup. &#34;Consider this my peace offering.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian huffed but accepted the coffee,taking a long sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, midway through, her eyes lit up with realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, and Nolan, he&#39;s something elsel The perfect future husband! He literally gave up the entire Stewart Group for you. Can you believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor tightened her grip on the cup, her brow furrowing slightly. &#34;Wait, what do you mean? He gave up the company?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s jaw practically dropped. &#34;You don&#39;t know?Seriously! Nolan didn&#39;t tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward and began recounting the hospital showdown between Nolan and Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How Norwood had faked a faint, only for Nolan  to see  through it, and then how Norwood had tried to force Nolan to give up Eleanor in exchange for the Stewart Group&#39;s shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wouldn&#39;t believe it! Erick said Nolan didn&#39;t even hesitate before choosing you over the Stewart Group.Norwood was so angry he almost fainted for real.Right after, he sent the butler to bring Wray.You know him, right? The one who&#39;s always scheming to take Nolan&#39;s spot. Looks like Norwood&#39;s planning to change who inherits everything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor listened quietly, feeling a tight ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a mix of bitterness and a little sweetness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected Nolan to go so far for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always protected her from life&#39;s storms, quietly,without ever asking for recognition or letting her know the full extent of his efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Lillian&#39;s phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced down, and saw it was a message from Rylan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It read, &#34;Don&#39;t spill anything to Eleanor. Nolan said so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian froze, realizing she had just given Eleanor the full play-by-play. In vivid detail. She then looked up at Eleanor and forced out a nervous laugh. &#34;Uh, Eleanor, I just remembered I haven&#39;t fed my cat yet. I should get going. Let&#39;s catch up another time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And with that, she snatched her handbag and bolted,like the devil himself was after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked, shaking her head as she watched Lillian disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even bother thinking too much about it.The hospital drama replayed in her mind anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, she walked over to the picture window and gazed at the night sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest felt warm, and a soft smile appeared on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the late hour on the clock,she looked over at Lilah, who was busy in the kitchen getting dinner ready. &#34;Lilah, you&#39;ve done enough today. Go on and take the evening off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah paused, frowning. &#34;But dinner&#39;s not ready yet,ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor chuckled softly. &#34;No worries. I got this tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lilah&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. In all her years working here, she had never seen Eleanor step foot in the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, madam. Be careful and call me if you need anything,&#34; she said, bowing slightly before leaving.</p>
