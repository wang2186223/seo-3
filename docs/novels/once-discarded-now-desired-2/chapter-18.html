                <p>While Eleanor struggled to find the right words, a neatly dressed staff member approached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Brooks, Mr. Brooks is waiting for you just ahead.Please come with me,&#34; the staff member said as he bowed to Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian clicked her tongue in irritation, muttering under her breath, &#34;Out of all moments, Ryland chooses now to appear. He really knows how to ruin the fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her complaints aside, she trailed after the staff member without further fuss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor exhaled deeply, a wave of relief washing over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mind settling, she turned her full attention to the gallery, taking the time to study the pieces carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her steps slowed as her gaze fell upon a painting titled Roses in Bloom by Rafael Turner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rafael, the most celebrated court painter of the last century, was known for works so rare they were deemed priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The painting&#39;s composition certainly held alure,yet something about the canvas didn&#39;t sit right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s brows knitted as she flagged down a nearby staff member. &#34;This piece seems suspicious.You should notify Mr. Gill immediately and have it taken down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t allow David&#39;s exhibition to be tarnished by even a hint of forgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member&#39;s expression darkened at her words. &#34;Madam, that kind of accusation is reckless.Every itemdisplayed here has been authenticated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he recognized her connection to Nolan, that didn&#39;t mean he would tolerate anyone questioning David&#39;s collection-or worse, making trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor parted her lips to explain, but a derisive voice cut her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An orphan like you dares to question an ancient masterpiece? Please. You&#39;re only here to cause a scene!&#34; The voice, dripping with venom, belonged to Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had slipped away the moment Jonny&#39;s attention faltered, and by chance, she stumbled straight into this confrontation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sneer, she shifted her glare to the staff member. &#34;And you call this security? How can you let someone like her even set foot inside? What kind of standards does this gallery have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Eleanor had made a fool of her. Now, Emma saw her chance to return the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The staff member, already leaning against Eleanor,found courage in Emma&#39;s words. His hand shot out,aiming to seize her arm. Eleanor&#39;s gaze turned icy as she slid back a step,cool and measured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip caught nothing but air. Overreaching, the man stumbled forward, nearly losing his balance in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s expression twisted in disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t even handle one woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma wasn&#39;t about to waste the chance handed to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her chin and raised her voice so the crowd could hear. &#34;Look at you-living off my brother-and now you dare to disrupt Mr. Gill&#39;s exhibition? Do you even realize who Mr. Gill is? And yet you&#39;ve got the nerve to call his painting a forgery!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sharp tone drew immediate attention, heads turning from every direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That lady can&#39;t be serious. She&#39;s far too young to make such bold accusations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a joint show hosted by David Gill and Dyer Curtis. Everything here has been verified-there&#39;s no way an error slipped through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Pretty face, sure... but probably just some bored socialite desperate for attention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices reached Eleanor, her brow twitching with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma really was hopeless. To spar with someone that foolish would only drag her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor decided she wasn&#39;t worth the breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd was already watching, so backing down wasn&#39;t an option. If this was a stage, then Eleanor would decide how the play unfolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned cold as she fixed them on Emma&#39;s smug expression. &#34;Emma, since you&#39;re so certain of yourself, why don&#39;t we settle this with a bet?&#34; The sudden challenge made Emma falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What game was this woman playing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did she find such nerve?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really know something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An orphan with no pedigree couldn&#39;t possibly understand antiques, much less paintings of this caliber.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had to be a bluff-some desperate trick to scare her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And besides, this was David and Dyer&#39;s exhibition.No chance anything here was fake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convinced of her own reasoning, Emma lifted her chin proudly. &#34;A bet it is! Do you think I&#39;m scared? If you lose, you&#39;ll apologize publicly-three times-and leave this gallery for good!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted nothing more than to see Eleanor humiliated, driven out with her reputation in ruins. But Eleanor&#39;s composure didn&#39;t crack. Her voice was cool and steady as she retorted, &#34;And if you lose?&#34;</p>
