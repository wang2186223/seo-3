                <p>Eleanor had no idea about Jonny&#39;s determination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, she was fully absorbed in her duties at the Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah had already seen the trending news online, but for a while, she kept it to herself, unsure whether to bring it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she gathered her courage and went over to Eleanor, speaking with quiet sincerity. &#34;Eleanor, you should start thinking about your own future. You can&#39;t spend your whole life here It&#39;s time you found someone to share your days with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The &#34;someone&#34; she hinted at was none other than Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s words caught her off guard, though she knew they came from a place of genuine care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning,she gave a soft smile. &#34;Myah, if I leave, who will be here to help you?&#34; she asked gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Myah could answer, a figure stepped into the doorway,his tall frame blocking the sunlight. Both women looked up, startled to see Nolan standing there. Neither of them had noticed when he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Why was he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah, however, recovered quickly. She nudged Eleanor forward with a knowing smile. &#34;Go keep Mr.Stewart company. Don&#39;t worry about the rest. He&#39;s been such a generous supporter of the orphanage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words sounded casual, but it was clear she was deliberately giving them space</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had read enough online to know that Nolan had feelings for Eleanor</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Myah practically pushing her, Eleanor had no choice but to lead Nolan around as though he were an honored guest</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They strolled along, talking off and on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a while, Nolan was the one to stop first</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Eleanor, a teasing smile in his eyes.&#34;What&#39;s the matter, my dear girlfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s cheeks burned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Girlfriend?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did that happen? She was about to snap back when he suddenly reached for her wrist,his touch warm and firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle tug, he drew her closer, and his voice dropped low. &#34;If you&#39;re going to find a partner,&#34; he murmured,&#34;it can only be me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,just as quickly, he released her. He slid his hands into his pockets, his whole demeanor shifting-now relaxed, almost smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since I&#39;ll be the one in the end,&#34; he added with a faint smirk, &#34;I might as well start the role early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could only stare at him, torn between exasperation and helplessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t argue with him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the entire city of Elepdon, there really wasn&#39;t a man who could compare to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And though she hated to admit it, their recent interactions had changed her heart. Slowly, bit by bit,she had started to feel something for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t just easy on the eyes. He was dependable, kind, and the kind of man who gave his all, and not only to her but also to the Hope House she poured her heart into. By all accounts, he really was the right choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor thought to herself that if she were ever to settle down with someone in this lifetime, Nolan wouldn&#39;t be a bad pick at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her quietness made Nolan&#39;s heart race. He realized he had gambled, and for once, luck was on his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been terrified that pushing her might scare her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she shone too brightly for him to stay still. He had been haunted by the thought that someone else could sweep her away if he didn&#39;t act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now,relief washed over him. The risk had been worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, he reached for her hand and snapped a picture of their fingers interlaced. W/ithout hesitation.he posted it on Twitter and tagged her account. &#34;My dear girlfriend, looking forward to our future.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his delight, Eleanor didn&#39;t stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he was the one she would end up with anyway,she figured she might as well start getting used to it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shared his post, tagged him, and wrote, &#34;My dear boyfriend,looking forward to our future.&#34; After hitting repost, she slipped her fingers into Nolan&#39;s hand,feeling the warmth of his palm. &#34;I&#39;m starving. Take me out to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s smile softened even more, his tone carrying nothing but affection. &#34;Whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them happily flaunted their relationship online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But while they enjoyed themselves, the Twitter staff were the ones paying the price</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their announcement hit the platform like a storm,crashing the server.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The operations team scrambled around trying to fix the mess, and when they finally got things under control, they left a helpless comment under the couple&#39;s posts. &#34;Next time, maybe warn us before dropping a bomb like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of couse, their plea was completely ignored</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Ryland and Lillian were equally floored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since no one could get through to Nolan or Eleanor directly,all the calls landed on them instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a bar, Lillian slammed her glass against the counter.  grinding her teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a few days ago, Eleanor swore she was too busy to bother with love, and now here she was, publicly declaring her romance with Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian refused to swallow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dead set on tracking Eleanor down and getting answers.</p>
