                <p>News of the Todd Group&#39;s collapse exploded across the media, plastered on every headline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot on its heels came the announcement that the Stewart Group had taken full control of the Usepsall project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Propped up against the hospital bed, Eleanor let her gaze drift from the flashing television to the man beside her, who was carefully carving neat strips of apple skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved with mischief as she remarked,&#34;Nolan, you make it look effortless. Toppling a company in the stock market as if it were child&#39;s play.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s lashes lowered as he trimmed the last curl of peel, then brought the fruit to her lips with calm  precision. &#34;It doesn&#39;t amount to much,&#34; he replied smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, the Todd Group had been nothing more than a small obstacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Usepsall project, however, carried weight-because it was where he had first crossed paths with her,impressed by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife clinked softly against the tray as he set it aside, and then he leaned in close enough for his breath to stir her hair. &#34;Tell me something.Watching Jonny fall this far-don&#39;t you feel even a trace of pity?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t bother lifting her eyes, though amusement sparked inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, could he be any more transparent?Jealousy fit him like a second skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deciding to messing with him, she let out a languid sigh and tipped her head back dramatically. &#34;How could I not? I&#39;ll admit it-there&#39;s still a corner of my heart that remembers him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan only chuckled, easily recognizing her mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of bristling, he wrapped an arm around her shoulders and pressed a kiss against her forehead.&#34;That&#39;s fine. Because at the end of the day, I&#39;m the one who gets to stay by your side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushed to her cheeks, painting them a betraying shade of red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could fire back, the hospital door creaked open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick slipped inside, his eyes landing instantly on the couple nestled together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face froze in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, why did he always walk in at the worst possible moment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just his luck-another paycheck deduction was practically guaranteed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden silence shattered when Nolan&#39;s voice cut through, cold and unyielding. &#34;Well? Spit it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted back to himself, Erick straightened and blurted out, &#34;Boss, your grandfather insists you come see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reply came from Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nudged his arm with quiet insistence. &#34;You should go. If you keep Norwood waiting, it won&#39;t end well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already knew from Erick that Norwood had shown up in person earlier, only for Nolan to send him away without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the old man had sent someone again, she understood it would only damage Nolan&#39;s standing if he refused a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing she wanted was for him to argue with his family because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After weighing it for a moment, Nolan finally inclined his head, loosened his hold on her, and rose to his feet. He adjusted his collar with a precise motion, slipping back into his composed and authoritative demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before turning away, he pressed her hand firmly. &#34;Get some rest. The guards are stationed outside-call them if you need anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor offered a small nod, giving him reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he really treating her as though she couldn&#39;t fend for herself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the Soul Surgeon, for heaven&#39;s sake. Taking care of her own injuries was the least of her skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut behind him, she scanned the room to ensure no one lingered.Satisfied she was alone, she began administering her own treatment without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting for her body to recover naturally would take far too long. With her methods, the healing process would be swift and decisive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of this was seen by Nolan, who by then had already entered the study at the Stewart family&#39;s residence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Norwood&#39;s side stood a young man whose face was unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He appeared a touch younger than Nolan, his features polished and his bearing confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood wasted no time on pleasantries. As soon as Nolan entered, his voice rang out. &#34;This is Wray Stewart-one of our distant relatives. He graduated from Kingswell University, and his abilities are exceptional.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray rose quckly, extending his hand with smooth composure. &#34;Nolan, it&#39;s an honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes lingered on him, sharp and unreadable.Instead of reaching out, he gave a slight nod in acknowledgment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood ignored the tension, his cloudy eyes flashing with authority as he dropped his verdict.&#34;From this day forward, Wray will oversee the Usepsall project.&#34;</p>
