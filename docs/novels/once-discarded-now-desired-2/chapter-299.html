                <p>With a bright smile, Fannie hooked her armn through Elora&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Elora, it&#39;s me, Fannie. We&#39;re about to go camping with Nolan&#39;s fiancée. Want to come along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Nolan&#39;s fiancée sent a fleeting shadow of jealousy across Elora&#39;s eyes, but it disappeared so quickly that neither Fannie nor Nolan caught it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a soft sigh, her tone carrying a hint of sadness. &#34;You all go ahead. I... I&#39;m not feeling well today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she subtly drew her hand behind her back, almost as if she didn&#39;t want anyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s attention sharpened at her pallor, a frown creasing his brow. He gently reached for her hand,and when he saw it, his face darkened with concern.&#34;Who did this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s hand was mottled with bruises, some fresh and others already fading, the sight startling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a rush, she yanked her hand away and shook her  head. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, really. I just took a bad fall. Aren&#39;t you about to head out? Don&#39;t let me hold you up. I only stopped by to say hello before checking into the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t buy her excuse for a second. His expression stern, he ushered her inside and settled her onto the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lilah, get my doctor here right away,&#34; Nolan instructed firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s hands flew up in protest, panic in her voice.&#34;No, Nolan, it&#39;s really not necessary. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan refused to budge, standing silently by until the doctor arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a careful examination, the doctor&#39;s expression turned grim. The verdict was clear: Elora had been enduring physical abuse for months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie clapped a hand to her mouth, horrified. &#34;That&#39;s horrible.Who could do something like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s jaw tightened as he demanded answers. &#34;Elora,are you still going to hide who did this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting as if she were cornered, Elora spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three years ago,I got a boyfriend. He was kind to me at first, but after my father died, and I had no one left  he changed. Whenever he got upset, he&#39;d take it out on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice quivered as she continued, &#34;Recently, I tried to break it off for good. But he started stalking me,threatening me, hurting me whenever he could.couldn&#39;t take it anymore, so I ran... I had nowhere else to go but here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Elora confessed, tears spilled down her cheeks, and she began to sob, her shoulders shaking with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie squeezed Elora&#39;s hand tightly, reassuring her,&#34;Don&#39;t be scared. He can&#39;t hurt you here. You&#39;re safe.Nolan won&#39;t let anything happen to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s tear-filled eyes flickered to Nolan, worry etched on her face, as if she were afraid to burden him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly tried to reassure him, &#34;Nolan, I never wanted to cause any trouble. I just wanted to see you If it&#39;s too much, I can always stay at a hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan thought it over for a moment before giving a firm nod. &#34;For now, you can stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always thought of Elora like a sister. There was no way he could leave her to fend for herself.Making room for one more at home was the least he could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie let out a visible sigh of relief, happy with his  choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s eyes filled with gratitude, and she thanked them over and over, tugging at Fannie&#39;s heartstrings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With arrangements in place, Nolan turned to Fannie.&#34;Stay here with Elora for a bit, Fannie. I&#39;m going to find Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie had hoped to spend time with Eleanor herself,but thinking of all Elora had endured, she agreed without complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By ten o&#39;clock, Nolan slipped out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had barely made it to the intersection when Fannie&#39;s urgent call came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan,Elora passed out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan hesitated only a moment before pulling out his phone to text Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something came up. We&#39;ll have to postpone our camping trip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the message sent, he turned the car around and headed straight back to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For his mother&#39;s sake, he was determined to make sure Elora had everything she needed.</p>
