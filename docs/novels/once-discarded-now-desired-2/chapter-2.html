                <p>&#34;Hmm?&#34; Jonny lifted his brows with mild surprise,studying Lainey curiously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly ever did Lainey ask anything of him. She had always carried herself as though she were above the material concerns, distant and untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his reaction, Lainey raised her eyes with a faint, shy look. &#34;Didn&#39;t you once tell me that the villa had the perfect surroundings and could serve as our future home after marriage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of their past sweetness softened him,and without much thought, Jonny nodded.that&#39;s what you want, then consider it yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor observed their sickening harmony,her lips curling into a mocking smirk. &#34;Jonny, only moments ago you promised me that house. Now you hand it over to her. Doesn&#39;t that strike you as shameless?&#34;  Her words caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During their three years together, she had always been quiet and yielding, never daring to speak to him in such a tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forehead creased, his voice edged with irritation.&#34;It&#39;s only one villa. I own plenty of properties. Pick whichever you want, and I&#39;ll transfer it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, sensing his displeasure, quickly added, &#34;Mrs.Todd, if you&#39;ll let me take the villa, I&#39;ll add another $10 million to your compensation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze swept over her with contempt. &#34;Miss Gilbert, are you joking? That villa alone is worth at least $60 million on the market. Do you really think $10 million can buy it from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from Lainey&#39;s face, and she turned toward Jonny with wounded eyes. &#34;Jonny, that&#39;s not what I meant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved by her performance, Eleanor interjected sharply, &#34;If you want that villa so badly, I won&#39;t refuse outright. But the price is this-Jonny must exchange it for ten percent of the Todd Group&#39;s shares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Lainey&#39;s voice rose in disbelief. &#34;Mrs. Todd,are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd Group was publicly listed, and ten percent of its stock was worth over one hundred million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s demand was outrageous, and everyone in the room knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s face turned grim at once. &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t test my patience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed,Eleanor met his glare. &#34;Either give me the shares or the villa, Jonny. The decision is yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air thickened with sudden tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the hostility mounting,Lainey tightened her hold on Jonny&#39;s arm and begged softly, &#34;Jonny forget it. I don&#39;t need that villa anymore. Wherever we live, as long as I&#39;m beside you, I&#39;ll be content.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words calmed Jonny, and the severity in his face eased somewhat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to Eleanor with a cold look. &#34;The villa is yours then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing she had secured her rightful claim, Eleanor lost interest in further argument and started to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey&#39;s voice rang out behind her. &#34;Mrs. Todd!&#34;When Eleanor turned, she found Lainey smiling sweetly. &#34;Thank you for looking after Jonny during these years. From now on, I&#39;ll make sure to learn how to be his wife properly,&#34; Lainey said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the tone sounded gentle, every syllable carried a challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor regarded her quietly, then burst out with sudden laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Striding back to the desk, she grabbed Jonny&#39;s untouched cup of coffee and flung it straight over both of them. &#34;Ah!&#34; Lainey screamed as the hot liquid splattered across her white dress, staining it badly and leaving her disheveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s tailored suit was soaked as well, and fury twisted his face. &#34;Eleanor! Are you out of your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She set the empty cup back onto the table with deliberate calm, her smile sharp. &#34;My mistake. I just caught sight of something repulsive and couldn&#39;t hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing them another glance, she walked out with steady steps, leaving the two of them in their disgrace.</p>
