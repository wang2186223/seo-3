                <p>By the evening of the following day, Nolan&#39;s sleek car glided to a stop precisely on time outside the Benton family&#39;s stately villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had just slipped into fresh attire and descended the grand staircase when she glimpsed her mother, Hilda, clinging to Nolan&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face was filled with maternal concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Norwood was known for his stern demeanor and traditional ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lived and breathed rules, clinging to status as though it were his lifeblood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Nolan had assured her that Norwood no longer disapproved of their union, Hilda&#39;s unease lingered like a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan, Eleanor has always been her own woman,speaking her heart freely. If her words ruffle your grandfather&#39;s feathers, please stand by her. Let any grievances fall on you, not her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s gaze met Hilda&#39;s anxious eyes with unwavering  resolve. &#34;Mrs. Benton, you have my solemn promise.No harm will come to Eleanor under my care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His steady words carried a quiet strength, soothing Hilda&#39;s frayed nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda observed that beneath Nolan&#39;s composed exterior lay a man of steadfast dependability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tender pat on Eleanor&#39;s hand, she reluctantly released her daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car pulled away from the villa, Eleanor caught a fleeting glimpse of Hilda in the rearview mirror,standing rooted to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of warmth flooded Eleanor&#39;s heart, the unspoken bond of family tying her to home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car soon arrived at the Stewart family&#39;s resident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Nolan and Eleanor stepped into the elegantly arranged living room, where Norwood sat regally in a high-backed chair, savoring a cup of coffee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Norwood&#39;s eyes fell on Eleanor, the usual austerity in his demeanor softened, replaced by a gentle, welcoming glow. &#34;Eleanor, it&#39;s a pleasure to see you. Please, make yourself at home,&#34; he said,gesturing with a gracious wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The long dining table was adorned with an array of  dishes, each one carefully chosen to suit Eleanor&#39;s tastes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t just happen by coincidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood had,with evident care, acquainted himself with her every preference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breaking the comfortable silence, Norwood deftly placed a piece of sweet and sour spare rib on Eleanor&#39;s plate. &#34;Tell me, have you two settled on a date for the engagement?&#34; he inquired, his tone warm with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint, knowing smile curved Nolan&#39;s lips. &#34;Not yet,Grandpa. But when we do, Eleanor and I would be deeply honored if you would officiate the occasion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face lit up with a broad, heartfelt smile, his eyes crinkling with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Splendid! Truly splendid!&#34; he declared, the word &#34;splendid&#34; escaping his lips twice, as though savoring its sound. The lines etched around his eyes seemed to soften with his delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eat heartily, everyone,&#34; he urged, his voice unusually tender as he turned to Eleanor. &#34;Come by whenever you can,Eleanor. Your presence would brighten this old house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor responded with a soft hum, her last traces of  wariness melting away like morning mist under the warmth of Norwood&#39;s kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Norwood gazed at the well-matched pair, a quiet reflection stirred within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been wrong before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Stewart family didn&#39;t need a polished but shallow figure to stand beside Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They needed Eleanor-capable, astute, and fiercely devoted, a woman who could weather any storm by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, with the wisdom of age, Norwood realized that many things lay beyond his control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of fretting over family quarrels, it was wiser to let the younger generation carve their own path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What he wanted most was to bask in the uncomplicated joy of being with family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner unfolded in a symphony of warmth and laughter, the air alive with shared stories and clinking glasses</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as the evening reached its crescendo, Hector,the butler, burst into the room, his face ashen with urgency.′′Sir, your son has returned!&#34;</p>
