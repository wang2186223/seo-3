                <p>The Bentons&#39; funeral was held at the most famous church in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests in attendance were all from powerful families, every face set in solemn respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To those who didn&#39;t know, it could have been mistaken for a state funeral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the crowd of mourners draped in black, Lainey was impossible to miss. She wore an elegant black designer gown, with sparkling jewelry on her neck and wrists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her makeup was flawless, not a trace of grief on her face. Instead, her expression carried a quiet smugness,as though the day belonged to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in a way, it did. Jeff and his wife&#39;s assets had fallen neatly into her hands. She had been waiting for this moment, and now it was finally hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her silent gloating was interrupted when someone exclaimed, &#34;The Stewvart family has arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smug smile vanished in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried forward, her tone soft, almost timid, as she greeted the man at the lead.&#34;Norwood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her eyes shifted, locking onto the figure just behind him. &#34;Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood took in her timid, lonely appearance and couldn&#39;t help but feel a wave of sympathy for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached out, gently patting her hand. &#34;You&#39;ve been through a great deal, my dear. These days must have been hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey offered a few weak nods, murmuring her thanks, but her attention had already slipped past him. Erick held a small box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart gave a leap. Was it a ring box?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought alone sent a thrill through her, her pulse quickening with greed. Around them, guests whispered among themselves, their voices a low hum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey&#39;s fortune is unbelievable. Losing her parents and now set to marry into the Stewarts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right? She&#39;ll be the president of the Benton Group and Nolan&#39;s wife. What more could anyone ask for?&#34;&#34;Some people are just born lucky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The jealous stares from the crowd fed Lainey&#39;s ego, making her feel untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it-her moment of victory. She had finally beaten them all, even Eleanor, who was no longer around to compete with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood cleared his throat, and the murmurs around the hall died instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t just come to mourn. He was here to seal the alliance before the public eye. &#34;Give Nolan the engagement ring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick approached Nolan, presenting the ring box with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s pulse raced as her eyes fell on the box.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she accepted Nolan&#39;s proposal of marriage, she would be his fiancée.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey tilted her head shyly, sneaking a glance at Nolan, waiting for him to accept the ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fingers tapped lightly on the edge of the box, his face giving away nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s brows knit together. Could his grandson be hesitating now, at such a crucial moment?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s chest tightened. A ripple of unease.spread through her, smothering the joy she had worn just moments ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t he taking it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he having second thoughts? The silence thickened until Nolan suddenly let out a low chuckle. The sound was soft, almost playful,but his smile didn&#39;t reach his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we move forward,&#34; he said, his gaze locking onto Lainey&#39;s anxious face, &#34;there&#39;s somethingl′dlike to give you. Consider it a &#39;gift!.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gift?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey blinked in surprise before the meaning sank in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, an engagement gift. He must be planning to present her with something special,in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe a piece of priceless jewelry, or a share transfer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her worries melted away, replaced by a flush of excitement. Whatever it was, it would only add to her glory.</p>
