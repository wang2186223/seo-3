                <p>Every head in the hall turned toward the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor walked in, a trail of maids at her side,moving slowly but steadily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finally looked up, her gaze cut straight through the crowd like a blade and locked on a single figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sat there, cool and distant, his whole presence out of place with the noisy hall-crisp suit, sharper eyes,watching her like he saw right through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face heated instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those eyes on her made her feel like she had just walked into a circus, the main act with no way off stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could already imagine Nolan&#39;s smug grin later,teasing her until she wanted to crawl under a table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lowered her lashes, her cheeks burning in a way she couldn&#39;t control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Horace? He read it all wrong. To him, that blush wasn&#39;t embarrassment, but it was shyness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest swelled with pride, and he grinned wide,throwing his arms out to his men. &#34;Eat, drink, and enjoy yourselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted in cheers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss her! Kiss her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,Horace, don&#39;t keep the girl waiting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s smirk grew as he leaned in, his eyes roaming over Eleanor&#39;s face like she was already his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But across the room, Nolan&#39;s expression snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw tightened, his eyes went black with fury, and the weight of his rage settled over the place like a storm about to break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he pulled a pistol from his waistband, and a gunshot ripped through the chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that very instant, Eleanor moved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if she had seen this moment coming.Her hand flashed, a dagger appearing, and she slashed down hard toward Horace&#39;s arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace wasn&#39;t some street fool. He had lived his life dodging blades and bullets.The instant he sensed the danger, he jerked his head aside just in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bullet still scraped past him, tearing his ear and drawing a hot line of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dodged the bullet, barely. But Eleanor? He couldn&#39;t dodge her. In the same heartbeat, her dagger sliced across his arm with brutal force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace staggered, holding his bleeding arm. He felt something hauntingly familiar about that attack... the speed, the force, and the way it was aimned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dripped between his fingers as he stared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those eyes, cold and unforgiving...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A memory he thought he had buried ripped its way back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago. That day... the woman who came out of nowhere and left him broken and humiliated.His eyes widened as recognition struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s her!&#34; His voice cracked into a roar.&#34;Damn it,it&#39;s her! That cursed woman! Somebody get her! Take her down!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his command fell into silence. Around him, the hall was filled with drunken men slumped over the tables, snoring loud and heavy.His men weren&#39;t ignoring him; they were out cold,drugged by McCollum&#39;s spiked liquor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s gut sank. For the first time, he realized he was completely alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then, Nolan stood up. He didn&#39;t rush. He walked forward,slow and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every step closer, Horace&#39;s heart plunged deeper into despair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suffocating weight pressed against his chest until he could hardly breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was over. He knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not only would he lose the woman, but his ownlife might very well be the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic shoved aside bravado. Without thinking twice,he spun on his heel and bolted for the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaiden, sharp as ever, caught on immediately and motioned his men to give chase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan stopped. His steps halted right in front of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, there was no one else in his world. Only her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled her into his arms, holding her as if he would never let go again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said, his voice thick with regret.&#34;It&#39;s my fault they even got the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had crushed them earlier, she wouldn&#39;t have had to face this mess at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face softened as she nestled into his chest.His familiar scent washed over her, chasing away the tension that had been clawing at her nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s meant to happen will happen sooner or later.Don&#39;t blame yourself,&#34; she whispered, giving his back a light pat. &#34;Besides, look at me. I&#39;m standing right here,perfectly fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan cupped her hand, his eyes searching every inch of her as though to make absolutely sure. Only when he was certain she was safe did a small wave of relief pass through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand was cold as he held hers. &#34;Let&#39;s go home.&#34;</p>
