                <p>How could that even be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be some sort of mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was an orphan, and not only that, she had always been such a kind and admirable person. How could she possibly have parents like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that thought, Lillian&#39;s temper flared. Her spine straightened, and with both hands planted on her waist like an angry lioness ready to pounce, she snapped, &#34;What are you all glaring at me for? Let me make this clear! I didn&#39;t lay a single finger on your precious daughter. She&#39;s the one who crossed the line,trying to flirt with my friend&#39;s boyfriend. When she couldn&#39;t succeed, she tripped on her own! If you don&#39;t take my word for it, ask anyone who was standing nearby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey already had a husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The accusation was so absurd that Jeff could hardly believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face grew dark, his presence suddenly sharp and commanding, making those around him feel small.&#34;Nonsense! Out of respect for the old ties between our families, I&#39;ll overlook this matter today. But if anything like this happens again...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment before continuing,&#34;Don&#39;t expect us to be polite! Our family may not be based here, but we won&#39;t be stepped on by just anyone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Benton family? Big deal!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had never been humiliated like this before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to argue again when Ryland quickly covered her mouth. Holding her close, he spoke softly.&#34;Lillian, calm down. The Benton family isn&#39;t easy to deal with. We can&#39;t create problems for Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Bentons turned against the Brooks family, Nolan would be forced to step in, and he didn&#39;t want things to reach that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s fire faded all at once. Her shoulders slumped, and her eyes stung with frustrated tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, on the other hand, caught the scene from the corner of her eye and smirked proudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Look at Lillian now... so powerless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for the need to act innocent in front of the Bentons, Lillian would havebeen finished today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lucky her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation seemed ready to settle when suddenly, a calm and clear voice cut through the air.&#34;What if|said I can prove it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff blinked, thinking he misheard. But then Nolan raised his eyes, calm and cold, and said with complete seriousness, &#34;Mr. Benton, please keep your daughter away from me. I already have a girlfriend, and I don&#39;t want her to get the wrong idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, he gave Ryland a meaningful glance before walking away with his usual composed grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland caught on right away and hurriedly pulled the still-fuming Lillian along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff,however,stood frozen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had watched Nolan grow up, and Nolan wasn&#39;t the type to throw accusations around recklessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Lainey really have a crush on him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was already married...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought only deepened Jeff&#39;s confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing his wavering, Lainey wasted no time: She collapsed into his arms, with tears streaming down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, you have to believe me. I never did anything wrong. I only admired Nolan and wanted to learn from him. I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d twist things like this. But I should&#39;ve known... he&#39;s close with the Brooks siblings. They&#39;ve always hated me because of their family&#39;s power. They used to pick on me constantly. How could Nolan ever see me kindly? I&#39;m sorry, Dad. I didn&#39;t mean to bring shame on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word was carefully chosen, and it hit its mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s chest tightened, and sternness melted away as he held her tighter.&#34;Don&#39;t cry, sweetheart. I&#39;ll protect you.Iwon&#39;t let anyone wrong you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Hilda watched silently, her gaze cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was no ordinary girl; she knew exactly how to twist emotions, how to win Jeff&#39;s trust with just a few tears. And it was working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Hilda didn&#39;t speak up for the time being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone in the Benton family needed to play along, to let Lainey think she was safe. That was the only way not to scare her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when the time was right, Hilda would finally uncover the truth. She would find her real daughter.</p>
