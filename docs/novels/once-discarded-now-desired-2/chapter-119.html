                <p>Two days after settling into the Benton family&#39;s estate, Lainey draped herself in a crisp Atelier Veyron suit and strutted into the Enigma store as though she owned the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heels clicked with sharp rhythm as she marched straight to Besty&#39;s office and knocked at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Besty sat behind her desk, eyes locked on the stack of reports in front of her. Without glancing up,she called out, &#34;Come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and the air was instantly saturated with Lainey&#39;s overpowering perfume.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty&#39;s brow twitched as she finally raised her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There stood Lainey, smiling that polished smile that looked pleasant at first glance but carried nothing but disdain beneath it. Having seen Lainey&#39;s manipulative tricks before,Besty already held her in contempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Todd, what business do you have with us today?&#34; Her tone stayed even and professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t flinch. She strolled in, dropped her designer bag on the sofa like it belonged there, and made herself comfortable in the chair opposite.Crossing one leg over the other, she announced, &#34;I&#39;m here for your boss, Enigma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty laid her pen aside, her face impassive.&#34;Unfortunately, she doesn&#39;t have time to meet with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft laugh slipped from Lainey, low and mocking,as though she had just heard an absurd joke. &#34;No time for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her bag, she produced a check and slid it across the desk with casual flair. &#34;Here&#39;s $20 million.Have her design a mother-daughter ensemble for me and my mother.&#34; Besty&#39;s gaze slid to the check, but her expression stayed cold. &#34;MMoney isn&#39;t the issue. Our boss has a standing rule-she doesn&#39;t accept private requests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered, Lainey reached once more into her bag,scribbled on her checkbook, and pushed forward a fresh slip of paper. Her voice carried a sharper edge now. &#34;$60 million. That should do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The figure made Besty&#39;s chest tighten. She wanted to spit out her disgust, furious that Lainey thought Enigma could be bought like any common designer.Yet sixty million was no small sum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That memory of Eleanor&#39;s tendency to prize money tugged at her mind. If anyone could be swayed,maybe it would be her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Besty pressed down her irritation, pasting on a thin smile. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll bring it up to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her politeness was forced, but Lainey couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had her sights set on Eleanor, not on someone like Besty, who didn&#39;t deserve her time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty&#39;s position wasn&#39;t random-Eleanor had picked her personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her taste matched what Eleanor valued most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the offer of sixty million reached her, Eleanor let out a dry laugh. &#34;Take the offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Money was still money, and it could be turned into meals for children who went to bed hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lainey wanted to flaunt her wealth,then so be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying out the instructions, Besty turned back with a firm reply. &#34;Our boss has agreed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s smug smile said she had seen this coming.She grabbed her bag and strolled toward the door with lazy confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the threshold, she paused and looked over her shoulder. &#34;One more thing-make sure your boss knows I expect the gowns finished by Sunday night.On Monday, my parents are holding a reunion banquet in my honor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bother to wait for acknowledgment.Instead, she flicked a golden-edged invitation onto the desk as if it were nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give this to her. As for you...&#34; Her gaze swept Besty from head to toe before she added with a dismissive smirk, &#34;Well, your presence isn&#39;t required.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heels clicked away as she departed, radiating the kind of elegance only she believed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she was out of sight, curious staff clustered together in hushed chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see that? Besty, she&#39;s unbearable with that attitude!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait, isn&#39;t she supposed to be the Benton family&#39;s long-lost daughter? How could she behave like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Benton family is as influential as the Stewart family. Families like that pride themselves on class.And that&#39;s what they raised?&#34; Sliding the invitation into her bag without the slightest change in expression, Besty replied casually, &#34;Let her act however she wants. We have our boss on our side, and she&#39;s not someone who can be pushed around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others had no clue, but Besty did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s influence reached much deeper than the surface ever showed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a flick of her wrist, she dismissed their whispers. &#34;Enough gossip. Everyone, back to work.I&#39;ve got a client contract to wrap up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering the necessary file, she left the office without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she stepped into the client&#39;s office, she was met with uneasy faces. &#34;Ms. Juarez, I&#39;m afraid have to apologize. Word has been going around that you&#39;ve somehow upset the Benton family&#39;s newly acknowledged daughter. Because of that, it may be best if we call off this partnership. Unless, of course,Enigma is willing to come in person to finalize the agreement, and in that case, we might be open to changing our decision.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty didn&#39;t spare him the courtesy of a reply. She turned on her heel and walked out, her disdain sharp and unshaken. If he thought he could cozy up to Lainey by disrespecting Eleanor, then he was nothing more than a fool chasing fantasies.</p>
