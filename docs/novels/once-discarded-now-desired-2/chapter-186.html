                <p>Nolan found out almost right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raced to the hospital, but the entrance was already crawling with reporters who caught wind of the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A team of bodyguards had to shove their way through the crowd just so he could reach the emergency room doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bright,almost harsh lights filled the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not tear his eyes away from the red light above the door. His eyes were starting to turn red, but he said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was his usual poise and confidence. In its place was a storm of anger that threatened to spill over at any second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew he had let his guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have kept Eleanor safe and never allowed anyone to get close enough to hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything happened to her, he would make sure every single person responsible paid for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had gotten there just before him, and the second she spotted him, she ran over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rimmed her eyes as she grabbed his arm and started hitting him in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your fault, Nolan! Every bit of it! If you had done your job and kept her safe, Eleanor wouldn&#39;t be in there fighting for her life! None of this would have happened!&#34; she said in between sobs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland hurried to pull his shaken sister into his arms, holding her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Nolan, who seemed completely lost, and spoke in a softer voice. &#34;Nolan, don&#39;t mind her.Lillian&#39;s just scared out of her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To everyone else, Nolan was untouchable. He was the head of the Stewart family, someone people respected and even feared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he looked completely defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland understood better than anyone that nobody took Eleanor&#39;s car crash harder than Nolan did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan did not react to Lillian&#39;s anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would not look at her. His focus never left the closed door in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A broken whisper left his lips. &#34;I know. It&#39;s all because of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t let things slide so many times, the people hiding in the dark would never have dared to go after Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really believed he could keep her safe, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he made careful plans, he still failed. She stil ended up hurt, and it crushed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spun around and fixed his bloodshot eyes on Erick, who had been following close behind. There was no hiding the anger burning in his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you track down the truck driver yet?&#34; he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick looked like he might shrink under the pressure of that glare. He struggled to breathe as he answered,&#34;We&#39;re still looking, boss. I&#39;ll bring in more people and find the driver as quickly as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, the emergency room doors swung open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A doctor stepped out, white coat crisp, and his eyes were serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan hurried over, anxiety clear in every movement. &#34;Is she going to be alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor pulled down his mask. His face softened a little, but he didn&#39;t look hopeful. &#34;The man in the crash got lucky. The airbags protected him, so his injuries are minor. Just a mild concussion. The woman took the worst of it. She broke two ribs and suffered a serious concussion. Right now, the biggest danger is how much blood she&#39;s lost.&#34; He let out a tired sigh before adding, &#34;Her blood type is AB, and while it&#39;s not especially uncommon, we&#39;ve completely run out of it in our supply. We just used the last of it on a pregnant woman who suffered an amniotic fluid embolism.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned. &#34;If we try to get more from the city&#39;s blood bank, it&#39;ll take no less than two hours. Even if we start collecting on-site donations now, we&#39;d need at least twenty people willing to give blood, and that&#39;s almost impossible to manage in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the hope Nolan felt slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not let Eleanor lie on that operating table for two hours without help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic set in. He grabbed the doctor&#39;s arm, his eyes turning red. &#34;Where can I find the hospital&#39;s broadcast room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor froze for a moment, caught off guard by the sudden question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a second, he pointed down the hall. &#34;Go that way and turn left at the end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan did not waste a second. He took off running, leaving everyone else staring in confusion, wondering what he planned to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the sound of his voice filled the hospital as the intercom crackled to life.</p>
