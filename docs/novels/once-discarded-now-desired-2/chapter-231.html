                <p>Nolan jolted awake from a terrifying nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his dream, Eleanor had been trapped in a wall of flames.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; he yelled, springing upright on the massive bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick and Norwood were right there at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room felt heavy, like grief itself was pressing down on him. It was almost suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan grabbed Erick&#39;s arm, his voice shaking. &#34;Where is Eleanor? Did anyone get her out? Tell me, where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kicked the covers aside and scrambled out of bed barefoot, not caring about anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood watched him with a complicated look. After a long sigh, he finally said, &#34;She&#39;s gone. The fire...after it was put out, the police found three bodies in the wreckage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Erick. &#34;Show him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick hesitated but finally picked up the tablet and handed it to Nolan. His fingers trembled as he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The glow of the screen lit up Nolan&#39;s pale, anxious face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline read, &#34;Breaking News-Fire at the Benton family villa. Jeff and Hilda Benton were confirmed dead. Will reveals younger daughter Lainey inherits most of the estate. Three bodies recovered, another presumed to be Enigma,Fans gather at the scene to pay respects.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dead...everyone? Eleanor was... gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stumbled back, his mind refusing to accept it. &#34;No, this isn&#39;t real. Eleanor... she can&#39;t be dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood sighed again, unable to watch Nolan fall apart. &#34;This has been confirmned by the police. What do you have to say now?&#34; Nolan&#39;s lips trembled as he looked at Erick for some kind of reassurance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick swallowed hard. &#34;Boss, I checked the surveillance. Miss Warren did go inside. We&#39;re just waiting on DNA results...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could say more, Nolan collapsed back onto the bed,completely drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stayed there for what felt like forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, suddenly, he snatched the tablet and hurled it to the floor. &#34;No. She&#39;s smart. She can&#39;t just be gone!Find her, now! And track down Lainey. I want answers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; Norwood barked, slamming his cane on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was the heiress of the Benton family now. Any reckless move would trigger a scandal, especially with her parents just passing away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet seeing Nolan so pale and frantic, Norwood softened slightly. &#34;The police will get to the bottom of this,whether it was some tragic mistake or someone&#39;s dirty work. Either way, Eleanor&#39;s gone. That means your engagement with her&#39;ends here. In three days, I&#39;ll send someone to propose to Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw Erick a sharp glare. &#34;Watch him. If he dares to make a move without my say-so, consider yourself unemployed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he walked off, the door shutting hard behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, silence hung thick. Erick glanced at Nolan, unsure of what to say. Finally, he muttered,&#34;Boss, I&#39;m sorry for your loss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan lifted his head slowly, eyes burning with stubborn rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Loss?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor was really gone, what reason did he have to keep breathing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan moved like a ghost, not eating, not drinking, lost in a haze of despair. Then, his phone buzzed, and a short message lit up the screen. &#34;I&#39;m alive. Just hurt, nothing serious. Since Lainey tried to kill me, why don&#39;t we flip her little game against her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor. It was her. Of course. With her aboilities, death could never claim her so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief crashed over him, and laughter burst out of him, raw and broken, until tears blurred his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s scalp prickled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where he stood, it looked like Nolan had finally lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was dead, and his boss had gone mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then Nolan&#39;s cold voice cut through the room. &#34;Erick, watch Lainey&#39;s every step. Also spread the word that I&#39;m devastated... that I can&#39;t accept reality, and I&#39;m drowning in despair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had Eleanor even found out about the fire at the Benton family&#39;s villa? And why would she throw herself into the flames without a second thought?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There could only be one answer-Lainey. She must have told Eleanor everything, using the truth about her bloodline to push her over the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a twisted little setup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick had no clue what had brought Nolan back to his senses so suddenly, but he didn&#39;t dare question it. He only straightened up and replied quickly, &#34;Got it, boss.&#34;</p>
