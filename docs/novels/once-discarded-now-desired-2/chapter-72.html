                <p>The morning of the ribbon-cutting ceremony dawned clear, sunlight pouring down like a blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything unfolded without a hitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah beamed as she and the children stepped into their new home, their laughter filling the air with warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, while joy spread in one place, bitterness brewed elsewhere. Inside the Todd family&#39;s vila, Lainey&#39;s mood soured with every passing minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glare fixed on the television, teeth grinding as Eleanor&#39;s face filled the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There she was-standing among children, her smile poised, her presence effortlessly radiant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What gave Eleanor the right to stand there looking so polished, so untouchable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes narrowed at the dress draped elegantly over Eleanor&#39;s figure. Wasn&#39;t that an Enigma design?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by suspicion, she pulled up Enigma&#39;s website on her tablet, scrolling through the latest collection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t expected much-certainly not confirmation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there it was. The very same dress, listed as this season&#39;s release, carried a price tag of no less than five million.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had been cast out of the Todd family. Where in the world had she found the means to afford something like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey racked her brain, circling the question again and again, but no matter how long she stewed, no answer came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One conclusion settled firmly in Lainey&#39;s mind-Eleanor&#39;s wealth couldn&#39;t be clean. Her gaze lingered on the television screen, and a twisted idea began to sprout, spreading like wildfire in her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor insisted on making life difficult for her, then she would return the favor tenfold. Eleanor would know no peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By that afternoon, her scheme was already in motion. An anonymous post exploded onto the trending charts, its headline crafted to ignite fury.&#34;Hope House ribbon-cutting? Orphans&#39; donations funneled into private pockets?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The post featured a glossy photo of Eleanor at the ceremony, her designer dress front and center as if it were Exhibit A.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Attached beneath were a string of grainy screenshots, allegedly showing Hope House&#39;s expense records,with a suspiciously large amount of money unaccounted for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reaction was immediate. The Internet boiled over with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is this woman? How shameless must she be to steal from an orphanage?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Absolutely disgusting-this is evil, plain and simnple!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;People like her shouldn&#39;t just be exposed; they should be thrown straight into prison!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Many netizens wasted no time digging into Eleanor&#39;s background, piecing together fragments until her past stood exposed for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait-she grew up in the orphanage herself? She, of all people, should understand how vital those donations are. For her to take from the children is beyond cruel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No wonder Jonny Todd got rid of her! If he&#39;d stayed married, the entire Todd Group would&#39;ve been dragged straight into scandal.&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The comments piled on endlessly, each more vicious than the last, drowning the feeds in venom. Lillian&#39;s blood boiled as she scrolled. Every word felt like a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did these people seriously believe Eleanor would stoop so low as to steal scraps from the very place she supported with her own money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t contain herself any longer. Her fingers flew over the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Utter lies! Eleanor donates tothe orphanage-she doesn&#39;t take from it! Why would she bother embezzling when she gives her own money? Stop spreading garbage!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her defense barely made a ripple. Within minutes, her comment was buried under a wave of fresh attacks, the trolls multiplying like someone had deliberately thrown fuel on the fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, this wasn&#39;t just gossip spiraling-it was orchestrated. Someone was pulling strings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian didn&#39;t waste a second before firing off a message to Ryland&#39;s assistant. &#34;Trace the IP of whoever posted this filth. I want to know exactly who&#39;s behind it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw tightened. Whoever dared to smear Eleanor like this wouldn&#39;t get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While waiting for a response, she kept refreshing the thread, scrolling furiously through the comments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not a single person defended Eleanor. Not one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with these people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they all blind-or just plain stupid?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was seconds away from unleashing her own tirade when a new notification appeared. Someone had finally spoken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name stopped her cold-Besty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From Enigma&#39;s verified account, a bold statement appeared. &#34;The gown worn by Miss Warren at the ribbon-cutting was an exclusive sponsorship from Enigma Group. Miss Warren has dedicated herself to Hope House for years, volunteering weekly and donating substantial funds. She is an example-to be admired,not slandered.&#34; Attached to the post were detailed records-receipts of Eleanor&#39;s donations, logs of her volunteer hours,proof stacked neatly for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Netizens might scoff at rumors, but no one dared question the authority of Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their word carried weight, and their brand left no room for doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, the storm of insults flipped on its head. The comment section overflowed with praise, the hate drowned out by admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief finally loosened Lillian&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Eleanor&#39;s name dragged through the mud had felt worse than being attacked herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had been right to trust Besty-when the situation turned dire, Besty knew exactly how to strike back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Lillian allowed herself a brief breath, a new message pinged on her screen. &#34;Miss Brooks, we&#39;ve traced the source. The IP behind the original post-and several troll accounts stirring the comments-all lead back to the Todd family&#39;s villa. Also, you&#39;ll want to see this. Attachments included.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian tapped the files open. Her lips curled into a sly grin as the images came into focus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect ammunition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she uploaded the screenshots and crafted her own post, each word aimed like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Funny how some people love preaching about charity. Remember that wedding pledge-$5 million promised for poor children, but only $3, 000 delivered? Was that just sloppy bookkeeping... or a deliberate scam? Lainey Gilbert, would you like to clear this up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian wasn&#39;t done. Her fingers flew over the keyboard as she fired off another comment beneath the post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A little advice for whoever&#39;s been hiding behind screens and buying trolls-maybe clean up your own dirty laundry before smearing someone else. By the way, the legal notice is already on its way. Do check your mailbox.&#34; For good measure, she attached the traced IP address, leaving no room for denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Lainey could defend herself.</p>
