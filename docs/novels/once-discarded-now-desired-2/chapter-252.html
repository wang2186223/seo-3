                <p>When Eleanor left Lillian behind and returned to Regal Heights, darkness had already settled over the estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the villa&#39;s entrance, a familiar silhouette emerged from the shadows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Hector.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed hurried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved quickly to intercept him, her eyes locked on the container. &#34;Hector, what&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Eleanor, Hector inclined his head politely.&#34;Good evening, Miss Warren.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled and began recounting the events candidly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m here to pass a message to Nolan. Starting tomorrow, Wray will step into the CEO role.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze darkened as she absorbed the news. Nolan ended up losing everything because of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although she bore no blame, her presence had inadvertently strained his grandfather and his bond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hector studied her quietly. After a brief pause,he added, &#34;Miss Warren, if possible, please speak with Nolan. His grandfather holds enormous expectations for him and truly cares. He shouldn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped momentarily and sighed wearily. &#34;Forget it. Old people rarely comprehend youthful matters.Still, I hope you won&#39;t resent Mr. Stewart. His actions stem solely from deep affection for his grandson.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,he departed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lingered in silence for a moment,then stepped into the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The living room welcomed her with the faint scent of cooked food drifting from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity piqued, she approached cautiously, her steps quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, the man destined to dominate Elepdon&#39;s corporate world now wore an incongruous apron,absorbed in preparing a meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The domestic sight made her pause, catching her  breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed unobtrusive, leaning against the doorway as she observed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Nolan turned, meeting her gaze. &#34;Baby,you&#39;re back. Wash your hands; dinner&#39;s ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft &#34;hmm&#34; escaped her lips, her thoughts swirling with mixed emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan Stewart, a titan in business circles, was personally cooking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And this came right after losing his authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was his calm genuine, or merely a mask?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused for a moment, then asked, &#34;Are you all right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying a dish to the dining room, Nolan returned to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze held steady, eyes glowing with the familiar warmth she remembered. &#34;I&#39;m fine, as you can see.Wash your hands and taste my cooking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sidestepped the subject effortlessly, ignoring the recent dismissal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor studied him silently, choosing not to probe  further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the phone Nolan had left on the counter lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instinctively, Eleanor glanced at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message from Erick appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, we&#39;ve contacted people in Zerovia, and the company&#39;s operations are fully arranged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything remained under Nolan&#39;s control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt a small relief, casually looking away as if she hadn&#39;t noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll be right there,&#34; she said with a gentle smile, then moved to wash her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During dinner, Eleanor&#39;s thoughts remained tangled with concerns about the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray,the incompetent fool,posed no real threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan confronted a furious Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One error could have irreversible consequences.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her mind wandered, a warm hand rested over hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, she met Nolan&#39;s deep, steady eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Besides, letting Grandpa release his frustration helps. We don&#39;t want him getting worked up and ending up in a hospital,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His composed assurance finally eased her tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,if you need assistance, I&#39;ll help however I can,&#34;she responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her own empire, though smaller than the Stewart Group,was still substantial enough to provide support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan laughed softly, patting her head affectionately.&#34;Fine,my girl is the best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned slightly, a mix of amusement and exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he handling her like a child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, she shouldn&#39;t have felt sorry for him-her sympathy only encouraged him to playfully exaggerate.</p>
