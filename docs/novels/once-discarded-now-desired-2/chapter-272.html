                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes sharpened instantly, a frosty edge cutting through the tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the notebook against her chest, she stepped forward, positioning herself in front of Nolan. Her gaze pierced the heavily made-up woman standing arrogantly before them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mind your words,&#34; Eleanor said icily. &#34;This used to be an orphanage. We&#39;re simply retrieving what belongs here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s face mirrored Eleanor&#39;s frost; his stare hardened like frozen steel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could Wray,barely a distant relative of his, dare to sully Eleanor&#39;s reputation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was practically inviting disaster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver ran down Wray&#39;s spine under Nolan&#39;s relentless glare, yet he forced calm over his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s backing had fortified his position, while Nolan had lost everything.Why tremble before him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moreover, with a beautiful companion around, he couldn&#39;t let Nolan have the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steeling himself, Wray lifted his chin and projected confidence, though it rang hollow. &#34;This site is now part of Stewart Group&#39;s major Usepsall development.Forget that tattered notebook; you won&#39;t touch a single page!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He motioned to the bodyguards behind him,signaling an escalation. &#34;Grab the notebook from them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tension crackled immediately across the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a piercing ringtone shattered the standoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritated, Wray yanked out his phone and answered without glancing at the caller ID. &#34;Who is this? Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m busy?&#34; The voice on the line stopped him cold. Arrogance drained from his features, replaced by stark shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beads of chilly sweat formed on his forehead, his skin grew ghostly pale, and his voice quivered with panic. &#34;What? This can&#39;t be... Fine, fine, I&#39;m on my way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking violently, Wray ended the call. When he turned toward Nolan, the prior smugness had vanished entirely, leaving sheer terror in its place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even panicked, he tried to assert dominance,blurting out a threat to mask his fear. &#34;I&#39;ll let this slide now!Next time, I&#39;ll settle scores with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He bolted, abandoning the stunning woman entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Move! Let&#39;s go!&#34; he shouted as he urged his men forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The group scattered chaotically, leaving the glamorous woman frozen, dumbfounded by their abrupt departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor observed the spectacle, eyebrows drawn in  confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could have frightened an arrogant Wray so completely?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s brow furrowed. He was equally perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could the company be facing trouble?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the moment, those worries took a back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ensuring Eleanor completed her task mattered more than speculative concerns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently brushing dust from her shoulder, he murmured, &#34;Ignore him. Let&#39;s get this to Myah first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had only just arrived at the Hope House when Nolan got a call from Erick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor wasn&#39;t able to catch the details, yet she noticed Nolan&#39;s face grow darker with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he ended the call, Eleanor pressed, &#34;What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a tight line, voice low and  steady. &#34;The Perry family has intervened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy&#39;s grandfather wielded immense influence,capable of covertly undermining the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, they had seized an entire quarter of overseas shipments, citing customs irregularities,striking at Stewart Group&#39;s financial lifeline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder Wray had been terrified earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he no longer led the Stewart Group,standing idle was impossible. The empire represented his grandfather&#39;s lifetime of toil and the family&#39;s enduring foundation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Eleanor didn&#39;t need the full story; he couldn&#39;t bear to burden her with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting her gaze with regret, he said, &#34;I&#39;m sorry,Eleanor, I can&#39;t accompany you inside. A driver will pick you up afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sensed the weight of the crisis in his tense demeanor.  He offered no details, so she didn&#39;t push any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded softly. &#34;Understood. You handle your matters first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she opened the car door and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan watched until she entered the Hope House,then drove away silently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor carried the heavy notebook into the courtyard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah sat on a small stool, glasses perched on her nose,darning a child&#39;s worn clothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spotting Eleanor, she set aside her tools, her expression brightening. &#34;Eleanor, you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded, extending the notebook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| found it, Myah. Here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s hands remained folded; instead, her gaze softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open it. See for yourself.&#34;  Curious, Eleanor obeyed, opening the fragile notebook carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pages were yellowed and delicate, each carrying decades of memories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned slowly, scanning the names, admission dates, and brief notes for every child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers froze on one entry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right there, written in bold letters, stood her name-Eleanor Warren.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, faded photo was attached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The infant in the photograph lay swaddled in a soft blanket, appearing only a few months old. Her face was angelic, and her large, round eyes glimmered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intricate clothing hinted she had not come from ordinary circumstances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside her rested a finely carved wooden rabbit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photograph radiated love, care, and protection.  Eleanor&#39;s heart pounded as unfamiliar emotions swelled inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah, standing beside her, spoke gently, a faint sigh accompanying her words. &#34;When parents lose a child, the suffering is theirs alone. The child grows up and moves forward, but parents endure the torment continuously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand rested lightly on Eleanor&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Try to understand them, Eleanor. These years have weighed on them too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Myah stepped away, leaving Eleanor in quiet reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lingered over the photograph, lost in thought, emotions swirling silently.</p>
