                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Eleanor and Nolan vanished completely from the venue that Lainey finally returned to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could hardly believe her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, acting as though Eleanor were the most precious person alive, was eager to hand over money?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly did Eleanor possess that made her worthy of such devotion?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her first instinct was to chase after them,but Jonny&#39;s hand held her back firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton family might wield incredible power in Breoqua,but here in Elepdon, the Stewart family ruled.Offending Nolan in his own territory would be a mistake even the Bentons couldn&#39;t rectify.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being restrained by Jonny only made Lainey look down on him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was utterly useless, always holding her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seeing Nolan&#39;s generosity sparked an idea. Once she was acknowledged by the Bentons, she would push them to extend their influence domestically and arrange a strategic alliance with the Stewart family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way, Nolan would eventually be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could have taken Jonny from Eleanor once,surely she could take Nolan too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her mind made up, Lainey stopped her protests and obediently followed Jonny back to the villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her compliance, however, was only skin-deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, her mind was a storm of anger and jealousy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking about Eleanor&#39;s bank balance churned her stomach with envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She assumed the money had come from Nolan and knew it would ultimately be hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scheming smile crept onto her face as she formed a plan to investigate Eleanor further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed, but she found nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she refused to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, just as she was about to shut down her computer, she stumbled upon a critical detail. The Queen&#39;s diamond tiara, the same one Eleanor had auctioned tonight, was an exhibit from overseas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to the rules, the auction winner had to pay customs duties. But Eleanor hadn&#39;t done so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes lit up with mischief. &#34;Eleanor, you&#39;ve brought this upon yourself,&#34; she whispered under her breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given her prestige in the design world, any post about Enigma would go viral instantly, and especially the one hinting at a legal misstep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So within a day, Lainey&#39;s anonymous tweet exploded online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The headline blared, &#34;Shocking news! Famous designer Enigma caught evading taxes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had even included a link to the official auction page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick click revealed the words &#34;tax unpaid&#34; listed under the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was indisputable evidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could almost guess who was behind this, but she had no way to defend herself. Technically, she hadn&#39;t paid the customs fee, but in reality, since the auction was for charity, no tax was required. Even if  she wanted to pay, the museum wouldn&#39;t accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Eleanor couldn&#39;t reveal this reason,or her identity would be blown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If that happened, she would end up spending far more than necessary on future auctions for national treasures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fans, unaware of these details, saw only the headline that their idol had broken the law.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment swept through the fandom, and many abandoned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the operation of Enigma&#39;s store in Elepdon was affected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After receiving a panicked call from Besty, Eleanor headed to the store immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped out of the car, she was swarmed by media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Warren! Is it true you evaded taxes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You spent $100 million on the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara;was that money legitimate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will Enigma brand suffer because of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty quickly appeared with her bodyguards, skillfully  creating a human shield around Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they reached the lounge, she handed Eleanor the report detailing the losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, I&#39;m sorry. My poor management...&#34; Besty&#39;s voice was full of guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had lost one hundred million in just one day, and she felt she had let Eleanor down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor took the document, gave it a quick look, and set it on the table. &#34;It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s not your fault.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could handle this loss, and if needed, she could make more under the name of the Soul Surgeon through the Underground Network, a move that would also protect her from constant scrutiny there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Besty felt responsible. &#34;There are fans willing to defend you, but they&#39;re afraid to speak out because of legal issues. Should we post something on Twitter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head. She would rather take the criticism than risk exposing her identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a few instructions to Besty and headed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, the persistent reporters hadn&#39;t gone anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paying them no mind, Eleanor walked directly to a  taxi at the curb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her calm, indifferent demeanor, completely ignoring the commotion, was once again photographed by onlookers, and within moments, the footage spread across social media.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The public reacted strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who does she think she is? She&#39;s so cocky!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at her! She&#39;s probably scared and staying quiet to dodge the problem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not responding is the same as admitting it.Investigate her thoroughly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, Enigma&#39;s once-spotless reputation began to tumble, the whispers growing louder with each passing hour.</p>
