                <p>Nolan had barely collapsed onto the sofa when his phone buzzed. Erick was calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart, we&#39;ve got something,&#34; came Erick&#39;s tense voice. &#34;The hospital cameras caught a suspicious guy wearing a hat and mask sneaking around Elora&#39;s room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Elora wasn&#39;t a liar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor&#39;s words had been right all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, why couldn&#39;t Eleanor try to see things from his side just a little?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tugged at his tie, frustration coiling in his chest. &#34;Double the security at the hospital. No one steps near Elora&#39;s room without my clearance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, boss. I&#39;ll handle it immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to his word, Erick moved quickly, not wasting a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as though recalling another detail, he added, &#34;Also, I&#39;ve taken care of the auction issue, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright.&#34; Nolan set the phone down and slumped onto the sofa, massaging his temples in exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Quiet steps sounded from the stairs, and Fannie appeared in her pajamas, still rubbing her eyes. &#34;Nolan,you&#39;re home? How&#39;s Elora?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His features softened at the sight of his little sister. &#34;She&#39;s fine. Everything&#39;s under control. Go get some sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie, holding her water glass, muttered under her breath, but loud enough for him to catch.&#34;It&#39;s been a while since Eleanor was here.Is she mad at you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confusion made Nolan&#39;s jaw tighten. &#34;Elora hasn&#39;t done anything wrong. So why&#39;s Eleanor making such a fuss over nothing?&#34; The moment she spoke, Nolan&#39;s features stiffened. &#34;Careful,&#34; he barked sharply. &#34;Don&#39;t ever talk about Eleanor like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie flinched, her glass tilting dangerously in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had always admired Eleanor, so Nolan&#39;s sudden harshness took her by surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small huff, she set the glass down and stomped back up to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sank further into the sofa, thoughts spinning like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe some distance was exactly what he and Eleanor needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, she would see his side of things,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor, the one who occupied every corner of his mind, had decided to step back from romance for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Warren Foundation still needed her attention, and she was determined to focus on growing her business and saving every bit she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, she arrived at her store, full of energy and purpose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Betsy was already in full boss mode, barking orders at the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Eleanor asked casually, glancing around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy spun around immediately and hurried over. &#34;Boss, a major client&#39;s coming. They say she&#39;s extremely picky, so we&#39;re cleaning the entire place from top to bottom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded quickly and went on her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she headed up the stairs, the glass door swung open once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland appeared, stepping in with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Wasn&#39;t it supposed to be a lady arriving?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland caught her look and chuckled.′′Mymom got tied up last minute. What, not happy to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s brow knitted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to get caught up with anyone associated with Nolan, not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a short nod and walked straight upstairs without stopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland froze, taken aback by Eleanor&#39;s cold reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before, even before her relationship wvith Nolan, she would have said something, anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy noticed the change too. With a knowing glance at Ryland, she muttered, &#34;Men. They&#39;re alI the same.Not worth a second thought.&#34;</p>
