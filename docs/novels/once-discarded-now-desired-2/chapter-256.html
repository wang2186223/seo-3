                <p>Eleanor had seen the news as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at the phone screen as it dimmed,her mind lost in a haze, her feelings tangled and restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Nolan came downstairs, he found her sitting in that daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked over, slipped his arms around her from behind,and rested his chin on her shoulder. His lips brushed close to her ear as he whispered softly, &#34;If it feels hard to accept, then thank them face-to-face.Hmm?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried a gentle, coaxing warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan knew her too well. Eleanor longed for family more than she dared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that her family was right before her, she simply didn&#39;t know how to reach out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His warm breath brushed her ear, making her shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted slightly, then turned to face him and gave a small nod. When Jeff and Hilda received the invitation,joy nearly lifted them off their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda tried on more than ten outfits in her walk-in closet,none feeling good enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff busied himself, wanting to bring every valuable painting from home,trying to win Eleanor over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda finally stopped him with a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting was set at Verdant Crest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jeff and Hilda arrived, nerves buzzing,they found Eleanor sitting alone by the window,her figure bathed in quiet solitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s chest tightened. She rushed forward, clutching Eleanor&#39;s hand as her voice trembled. &#34;Sweetie,how have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, a little uneasy, gently pulled her hand back.With a polite smile, she replied, &#34;I&#39;m fine. Thank you for your concern. I invited you today mainly to thank you for standing up for me against Wray.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda felt wounded by the gesture, but she didn&#39;t hold it against Eleanor. She knew they owed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Eleanor&#39;s distance, she dared not show too much affection. She feared her love would only weigh heavier on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Jeff stepped in, pulling Hilda closer.With a cheerful smile, he said, &#34;This is nothing. Don&#39;t feel burdened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t know what to say, the Bentons wwere afraid of being too eager. As a result, silence lingered until the meal ended, leaving the air awkward and heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stood politely, said her goodbye, and turned to leave the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda watched her walk away, tears spilling at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff wrapped his arms around her, wordlessly comforting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew they had once hurt Eleanor deeply.Healing her heart would take time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the restaurant, Eleanor didn&#39;t head straight for Regal Heights. She asked the driver to take her to the Hope House instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only there could her restless heart find a sliver of peace. Myah was handing out snacks to the children when she saw Eleanor. She waved her over. &#34;Come,sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor walked up and took the basket from her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The children quickly gathered around, calling her name sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they ran off to play in the courtyard, Myah led Eleanor to a bench. Her voice was soft. &#34;Got something on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t answer. She only rested her head on Myah&#39;s shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, she fnally whispered, &#34;Myah,when children here were found by their parents,how did they feel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s wrinkled hand stroked her back gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t press, but instead spoke slowly. &#34;Some cried and rushed into their parents&#39; arms, as if all the waiting had been for that one moment. Some were bitter, certain their parents had abandoned them, and refused to forgive. Others felt lost, unsure of how to face the sudden return of family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her voice warm and steady. &#34;Family ties are never simple. There&#39;s no fixed answer. Their  stories belong to them. Yours belongs to you.Only your heart can tell you the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Myah stood and quietly left her to her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sat alone on the bench for a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening breeze brushed past as the sky slowly deepened into night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Nolan called that she rose and returned to Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, Eleanor couldn&#39;t find sleep.</p>
