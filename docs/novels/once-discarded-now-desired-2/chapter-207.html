                <p>Ryland burst into the room, and the scene before him immediately sent a shiver down his spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hurried over to Nolan, lowering his voice to a tense whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On my way here, Erick sent a message. A private jet left for Zerovia last night, and someone at the airport reported seeing a woman who looked exactly like Eleanor on board.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in a while, Nolan&#39;s icy intensity softened just slightly at the news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sharp eyes swept over the three people in the room, noting their mixed reactions. He turned to the bodyguards, his tone was sharp. &#34;Nobody goes anywhere. Not a single person leaves without my say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was basically a house arrest with luxury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among those trapped inside were the former leader of the Stewart family and one of Breoqua&#39;s most influential elites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The absurdity of it all wasn&#39;t lost on Ryland. He opened his mouth to protest, but Nolan had already pivoted and was storming toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland swallowed and fell in step behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the airport. And broadcast this globally-anyone who locates Eleanor and keeps her safe gets a hundred million reward,&#34; Nolan instructed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bodyguards nodded and practically sprinted to carry out the orders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood stayed frozen, clutching his chest as if Nolan&#39;s very presence had knocked the wind out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The butler&#39;s face went pale. He darted forwad to steady Norwood, barking at the other staff. &#34;Hurry!Call the doctor now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood sat back down, his eyes burning with disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had he done to deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His once-proud grandson had confronted him over a woman of unknown background more than once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was outrageous!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it was all his own fault. He shouldn&#39;t have handed too much power to Nolan just because of Colson&#39;s  incompetence,.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with Nolan in command, the boy had the nerve to defy him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew in a shaky breath and casta quick,apologetic glance at Jeff. &#34;Sorry you had to witness this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff waved him off calmly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry about it,Mr.Stewart. Right now, we need to focus on finding Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, standing nearby, watched the scene unfold,her shock evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had treated him like that, yet Jeff stayed calm,almost unnervingly so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he worried about that insufferable Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made a flicker of jealousy flare in Lainey&#39;s eyes, but she quickly straightened up and spoke in a composed, concerned tone. &#34;I think everyone&#39;s overreacting a little. I heard Miss Warren has been seeing several men on the side, so maybe she ran off with one of them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Norwood, she added smoothly, &#34;Norwood,Nolan&#39;s obsessed with her. That&#39;s why he&#39;s acting so rashly. You shouldn&#39;t be upset with him.&#34; Lainey&#39;s words were smooth, almost sweet, but they  were carefully calculated-throwing shade at Eleanor while giving Nolan an excuse for acting like a maniac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s face relaxed as he listened, a hint of respect appearing in his eyes. He regarded Lainey with genuine approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip about her was clearly baseless. Her grace,her calm confidence, and her eloquence all made her look leagues above that scheming Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff,however,barely registered Lainey&#39;s performance.His mind was on Hilda back at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had already deployed people to their home...was she alright?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Norwood temporarily settled, the conversation shifted back to less volatile topics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey saw her opening and slipped away into a quiet corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled out her phone, dialing fast, and whispered as soon as someone picked up. &#34;How&#39;s it going? Has that... problem been taken care of yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s voice on the other end was slow and teasing,as if he had all the time in the world. &#34;What&#39;s the hurry?When do I get my shares?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyebrows shot up. That greedy moron! Despite her anger, she kept her cool. &#34;You&#39;ll get everything promised as soon as it&#39;s handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace snorted skeptically. &#34;I want half the shares now,or don&#39;t expect it to be done right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s hands tightened around the phone. She could almost crush it in frustration, but she needed him for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting her teeth, she replied, &#34;Fine. Half now, but the shares aren&#39;t in my hands yet. I&#39;lL give you $100 million as a deposit first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace was silent for a moment before hanging up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey stared at her phone, annoyed to the max.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even gotten the chance to check on Eleanor&#39;s status, and he hung up like it was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bastard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she wasn&#39;t sweating it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace was hooked now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t bail. He had no choice but to follow through.</p>
