                <p>While Emma and Lainey spoke, footsteps echoed from the foyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny walked in, shoulders heavy with fatigue, his tie loosened and expression drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Emma caught sight of him, she gave a loud, indignant huff, spun on her heel, and stormed upstairs without so much as a glance back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey forced her envy down, smoothing her features into softness as she stepped toward him. &#34;Jonny...you&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lifted, hazy and distracted, and for a fleeting moment, Eleanor&#39;s smile seemed to flash across Lainey&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. He clenched his jaw, shaking his head sharply. Was he losing his mind, imagining that woman in front of him? &#34;Lainey.&#34; His voice was clipped, dismissive. &#34;It&#39;s late.I&#39;ll have the driver take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words cut clean, leaving no room for argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her practiced smile faltered, the corners trembling before she forced them back into place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her nails dug into her palms. Since when had Jonny ever turned her away like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s accusation earlier rang in her ears-was Jonny really falling for Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible. That woman had nothing-no pedigree,no power,no status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet...what if he was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She couldn&#39;t sit idly by and risk losing everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men&#39;s affections were fickle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What lasted was control-wealth, power, security.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what she had to seize, now more than ever. Tears suddenly wwelled in Lainey&#39;s eyes as she slipped her hand from his. Her voice trembled,though her words were measured. &#34;Jonny... it&#39;s alright. I don&#39;t need the driver. I only came tonight to say goodbye.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on her heel, she let her shoulders quiver faintly, the image of a woman too choked with grief to explain herself any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The haze in Jonny&#39;s mind shattered instantly. Panic cut through his exhaustion, and he stepped forward,his chest tightening. &#34;Lainey, what&#39;s going on? Tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, she pivoted back, catching his gaze at the precise moment his worry peaked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes clung to him with deliberate sorrow, heavy with reluctant affection. &#34;Jonny... we should end this.My family can&#39;t afford to wait any longer. Our business has been struggling, and my father&#39;s alreadly speaking with a foreign partner. He wants me to marry into their family.&#34; Her voice broke at the edges, yet her delivery was flawless. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t disobey my father... or turn my back on my family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze, then unraveled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seized her with both arms, clutching her as though sheer force could bind her to him forever.&#34;No, Lainey. Don&#39;t say that. We&#39;ve fought too hard to be together. I won&#39;t lose you now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, she was perfection itself-the woman he had longed for, the one he believed he couldn&#39;t live without. Letting her go felt impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that desperation, a reckless promise burst from him. &#34;The Usepsall project is vast, Lainey. Tomorrow,I&#39;ll transfer forty percent of the distribution rights directly into your hands. Once you control that share,your father won&#39;t dare pressure you again. For the Todd Group&#39;s sake, he&#39;ll have no choice but to support us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of triumph sparked in her eyes before she quickly dimmed it, replacing victory with feigned doubt. &#34;Jonny...are you sure you can do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gripped her hand with fierce conviction. &#34;I&#39;d give you everything if it meant keeping you by my side.Nothing-no one-will come between us this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression melted into relief, a delicate smile breaking through her tears. She buried herself against his chest, voice trembling with delight.&#34;Jonny...I knew you wouldn&#39;t fail me. I knew you were the only one who truly cared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had wasted three long years wearing the title of Jonny&#39;s wife, and what did she walk away with?Nothing but scraps and humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey smirked to herself. She wouldn&#39;t be that foolish. A little sweetness here, a touch of vulnerability there, and Jonny was already placing the world at her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The desired seat of Jonny&#39;s wife? That was hers for the taking. And when the time was right, the entire Todd Group would follow.</p>
