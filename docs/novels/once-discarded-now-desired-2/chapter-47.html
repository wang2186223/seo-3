                <p>After spending some intimate time with Jonny, Lainey finally left, though reluctantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jonny watched her back fade into the distance,Eleanor&#39;s face suddenly came to mind, bright and vivid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she deliberately trying to provoke Lainey? Was that why she sent the recording? To make Lainey doubt him? Could it be jealousy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, why would she bother doing something so petty?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman was infuriating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he had been willing to give her a graceful way to back down, she rejected it. And now that he had cut her off, she was pulling every cheap trick to stir up trouble between him and Lainey. Forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Grandma&#39;s sake, he would give Eleanor one last chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed his suit jacket from the chair and made his way downstairs, sliding into the black sedan waiting by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he pulled the door shut, his eyes flicked briefly to the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was new, an unfamiliar face, but Jonny didn&#39;t give it much thought. &#34;To the Podium Apartments,&#34; he ordered flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Todd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor got back to her apartment building she instantly saw Jonny hanging around, like an unwelcome shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted slightly, and instead of heading toward the main entrance, she turned toward a side entrance to avoid him. She couldn&#39;t understand him at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was still married to him, Jonny couldn&#39;t keep his distance fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now, he kept showing up on his own, uninvited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he trying to play at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny saw her and quickly stepped forward, blocking her way. &#34;What&#39;s the meaning of this? I&#39;m right here.Didn&#39;t you notice me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stopped and lifted her eyes to meet his with calm confidence.&#34;Oh, I saw. Just happened to notice a scumbag standing there. What a terrible day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s teeth clicked together in anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she really just call him a scumbag to get his attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to speak again, ready to throw her another chance to patch things up, when a clear,low voice rang out. &#34;Erick, find out who this scumbag is that keeps pestering Miss Warren, and get rid of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Nolan stood tall, posture straight,his expression cool and unreadable. &#34;Miss Warren, what a coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick nearly laughed aloud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t even bothering to hide his reason for being here anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had received word earlier that Jonny&#39;s car was headed for the Podium Apartments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had told his staff he was inspecting a new property development nearby, but now here he was,exactly where Eleanor lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obvious enough. He wasn&#39;t here for business. He was here for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Always saying one thing while meaning another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Erick&#39;s eyes flicked between Nolan and the unfamiliar driver in Jonny&#39;s car. The two exchanged a subtle, knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Jonny was completely oblivious. Forcing a strained smile, he greeted stiffly, &#34;Mr. Stewart,what brings you here today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t even glance at him. Instead,he walked straight up to Eleanor. &#34;It&#39;s late. Since we&#39;ve run into each other, how about joining me for a meal? I still owe you a proper thank-you for saving Fannie last time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was taken aback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes instinctively darted to Jonny, whose expression was thunderous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she quickly made her choice. Better to spend her time with Nolan than waste it dealing with Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least Nolan was easier to bear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she said calmly. &#34;Then I&#39;ll accept.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining her poise, she walked beside Nolan and slid gracefully into the waiting black Bentley.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny stood frozen, seething inside. His anger was ready to erupt, but he forced it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Stewart Group&#39;s reinvestment into the Todd Group, he couldn&#39;t afford to offend Nolan now. He would just have to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, Nolan couldn&#39;t really have feelings for Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the novelty wore off, he would have plenty of ways to deal with her.</p>
