                <p>Lillian made her way towards the bar&#39;s exit but stopped short when she saw Jonny sprawled drunkenly on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His suit was rumpled, his hair was sticking up like a bird&#39;s nest, and he was nothing like the polished president image he usually tried so hard to maintain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his arms, he held a crudely carved wooden rabbit,clutching it tightly as he muttered in a slur, &#34;Eleanor.sweetheart...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her friend&#39;s name, Lillian&#39;s fury spiked.She almost smacked him right there</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This scumbag!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was all this so-called affection back when it actually mattered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scowling in disgust,she turned sharply and made for the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right at the doorway, she nearly collided with Lainey. Lillian couldn&#39;t be bothered. Without a word, she sidestepped and swept past her, as if Lainey weren&#39;t even worth a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, on the other hand, seethed inside at the blatant dismissal. Still, she bit her tongue and pressed forward, only to see Jonny slumped on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her stomach sank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was what he had been doing? Did he have no shame left at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Eleanor&#39;s bombshell post, Jonny had stormed out without explanation. Now here he was, humiliating himself in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the bartender hadn&#39;t called, she wouldn&#39;t even have bothered showing up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She jabbed him with the tip of her shoe &#34;Jonny, get up. We&#39;re going home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment he realized it wasn&#39;t the woman he wanted, his drunken fury flared. &#34;Who the hell are you?Get lost! You&#39;re not my wife. Eleanor is my wife! She&#39;s my only wife!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bar instantly buzzed with whispers and side glances. The crowd, who already recognized Jonny,were clearly enjoying the spectacle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was how the so-called golden couple ended up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s face burned. Jonny could afford to be a drunken fool, but her pride wouldn&#39;t allow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a fit of rage, she snatched the rabbit from his arms and hurled it to the floor. &#34;Jonny, look at me properly!I&#39;m your wife. Not Eleanor! Me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for his reply, she dragged him up with brute force and hauled him toward the door, ignoring the murmurs and mocking stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of them noticed the tall man who stepped forward once they stumbled away. His bespoke suit was sharp,his presence commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,he walked over to the wooden rabbit left behind, crouched down, and picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he studied it, his sharp eyes widened in disbelief.Wasn&#39;t this the very same rabbit his boss&#39;s daughter had held in her arms when she disappeared twenty years ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He straightened, his voice dropping low and cold as he addressed the bodyguard at his side. &#34;I want  everything there is to know about that woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days later, at the Gilbert family&#39;s estate, Kurt and his wife sat nervously in the drawing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man across from them radiated authority with nothing more than his posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt rubbed his palms against his knees, finally mustering the courage to speak.. Perkins,regarding the Homecoming Support Foundation you mentioned, we&#39;re more than willing to provide full support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truthfully, he couldn&#39;t believe their luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny Perkins was a man of mystery and immense influence, yet here he was, offering a partnership that came with nothing but benefits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why him? What had he done to earn this stroke of fortune?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Denny lifted his teacup and spoke without looking up.&#34;No need for pleasantries, Mr. Gilbert, I didn&#39;t come here solely because of your family&#39;s influence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally raised his eyes, sharp and deliberate. &#34;It&#39;s also because I heard that your daughter was adopted.&#34;</p>
