                <p>Eleanor sensed someone was watching her, though she didn&#39;t bother to look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stayed focused on Nolan&#39;s hand, taking in the lines of his knuckles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Redness spread across his skin, and a few scrapes still oozed blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must have hurt himself when he broke through that door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the car&#39;s emergency k&lt;it, she grabbed some antiseptic swabs and drew his hand toward her. &#34;Are you in pain?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan glanced down, taking in how careful and gentle she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, he flipped his hand so he could hold hers, brushed his lips over her knuckles, then lifted his eyes. They were full of quiet hurt. &#34;It does,but nothing compares to the ache I feel inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t defended herself back there, and he could tell she was about to let go of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blamed himself for mishandling everything,making her suffer because of his family.He couldn&#39;t really blame her if she wanted to give up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words, and the memory of what she had been thinking earlier, made Eleanor&#39;s heart twist with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While dabbing at his wound, she kept her eyes elsewhere, careful not to meet his stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, she finally tried to explain, &#34;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea.I just...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Ryland&#39;s urgent voice cut in from outside the car. &#34;Nolan, something&#39;s happened.Your grandpa collapsed, and they took him to the hospital!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hand closed tighter around hers. She caught the worry on his face, so she gave his hand a gentle pat. &#34;Don&#39;t stress. We&#39;ll go check on him together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at her then, emotion flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what happened, he couldn&#39;t bring himself to resent Norwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few seconds passed before he finally spoke, his voice low and deliberate.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the hospitall, Norwood still hadn&#39;t woken up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A team of doctors crowded the bed, their faces grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Nolan stepped inside, the doctors ushered him out of the room for a quiet conversation in the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back in the hospital room, only Eleanor and Norwood remained. He lay there, silent and unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor moved closer to the bed and checked the monitor before studying Norwood&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked weak, with pale lips and an angry flush across his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body had clearly reacted badly to the shock of all the emotional turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If nobody stepped in quickly, theconsequences could be dire, even fatal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still Nolan&#39;s grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bring herself to just stand by and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Eleanor quietly reached into her bag for a compact medical kit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked out the needles and started working without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bit by bit, the erratic lines on the screen started to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s eyelids fluttered before he finally opened his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he caught sight of Eleanor by his bedside, he erupted at once. &#34;Get out! Our family will never  accept someone like you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan heard the uproar and entered in a rush, the doctors right on his heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The medical team stared at the monitor, then at Norwood, shocked to see him conscious and yelling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is truly a medical miracle! By all accounts, the patient shouldn&#39;t have woken up this easily. He shouldn&#39;t be talking right now, let alone shouting.Can anyone explain what just happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s attention shifted from the stable readings to his grandfather&#39;s face, then landed on Eleanor. He understood immediately what she had done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor barely reacted. She gave Norwood a calm look and, in an even voice, said, &#34;He&#39;s out of danger now, so l&#39;ll go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her only reason for being there was Nolan. Now that his grandfather was safe, her job was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever insults Norwood hurled at her didn&#39;t bother her anymore. Without another word, she left the hospital room.</p>
