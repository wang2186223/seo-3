                <p>After enjoying several more days at the seaside retreat, Eleanor and Nolan eventually made their wNay back to Elepdon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word somehow traveled fast, as Hilda and Jeff had already caught wind of their return and were waiting eagerly at the arrivals gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sleek, understated Rolls-Royce was parked in the most prominent spot, drawing subtle attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the doors swung open, Hilda and Jeff hurried over, faces alight with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their warm welcome impossible to resist,Eleanor ended up being swept away and taken straight back to the Benton family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan could do nothing but watch as her parents whisked her away, never giving him the chance to ask if he could come along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before long, the Benton family&#39;s car vanished down the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left alone in his own car, Nolan couldn&#39;t ignore the creeping sense of emptiness that settled over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was truly glad for Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were, after all, the parents she had dreamed of finding, a family she had always wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, a sharp stab of jealousy caught him off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian,her ever-present best friend, always seemed to come first in Eleanor&#39;s world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, with her parents finally back in her life, they clung to her as though they never wanted to let her out of their sight again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Winning her hand felt like an endless uphill climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought left Nolan letting out a heavy, resigned sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over at the Benton family&#39;s villa, a joyous atmosphere filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following Hilda&#39;s instructions, the chef had outdone herself, dish after dish gracing the table, each one tailored to the local favorites.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda could hardly tear her gaze away from Eleanor,holding her hand tightly and taking in every detail as if trying to make up for lost time. Nolan had initially promised Eleanor a brief getaway that was meant to last just two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brief escape had stretched into nearly a week.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever they called to check in, their only excuse was that they were having too much fun to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one point, Hilda nearly marched straight to the resort herself to bring Eleanor home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every moment with her daughter felt precious, and Hilda longed to make up for the decades they had spent apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During dinner,Hilda piled food onto Eleanor&#39;s plate at every opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sweetheart, try some of this. The shrimp came in fresh this morning. And have some of the soup, too.I asked the chef to simmer it all afternoon. It&#39;s good for you,&#34; she said,her voice full of motherly concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff mostly stayed quiet, but his gentle smile and affectionate eyes said more than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the meal went on, Hilda suddenly remembered something important. With a sly, knowing smile, she slipped a hand into her pocket and pulled out a velvet box. She flipped it open, revealing a diamond bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the same bracelet she had clung to during that terrible fire years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I want you to have this,&#34; Hilda said as she slid the box across the table towards Eleanor. &#34;My mother gave it to me, and now it&#39;s yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gazed at the diamond bracelet, instinctively wanting to decline, as it felt far too valuable to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having only recently rejoined the Benton family, she felt she hadn&#39;t earned the right to accept something so precious. The thought of taking such a meaningful gift made her uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her reluctance,Hilda squeezed Eleanor&#39;s hand,her own eyes brimming with emotion. &#34;Oh,sweetheart, you don&#39;t have to be so formal. I&#39;m your mother. This has always belonged to you. I was just holding onto it until you came back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gave an encouraging nod. &#34;Go on, Eleanor.Take it. It&#39;s your mother&#39;s way of showing you how much she cares.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With both her parents looking at her so expectantly,Eleanor found she couldn&#39;t say no. In a gentle voice, she whispered, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s whole face brightened, her joy unmistakable.With utmost care, she fastened the bracelet around Eleanor&#39;s wrist herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bracelet was fitting as though it had been made just for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes lingered on her daughter&#39;s wrist, glistening with happy tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, a deep and genuine happiness filled her heart now that her daughter was finally back where she belonged.</p>
