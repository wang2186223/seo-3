                <p>Nolan genuinely hadn&#39;t noticed Eleanor&#39;s message because his phone had completely died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was ICU, and the nurse had insisted that no electronic devices be plugged in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when a doctor entered to check on Elora could he head toward the nurse&#39;s station to recharge his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he powered it on, Eleanor&#39;s message appeared, timestamped two hours prior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Eleanor feel upset?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiously, Nolan tapped out a response. &#34;Baby, I&#39;m sorry-my phone died earlier. Since Elora hasn&#39;t woken yet, I can&#39;t go anywhere. When she&#39;s better, l&#39;ll set things right with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange unease lingered for a moment, though he convinced himself he might be imagining it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In reality, Nolan&#39;s instinct had been correct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reading his text, Eleanor deleted it immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t blaming him; nor was anger present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather, she felt the need to reconsider their relationship.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slipped her phone into her bag and walked outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever confusion struck, she sought solace at the Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This situation proved no different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet just as she left the Benton family&#39;s villa, an ordinary sedan stopped abruptly in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window rolled down slowly, revealing a face she despised. It was Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor frowned, pivoting to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, however, refused to retreat. He stepped out swiftly, clutching an ostentatious bouquet of red roses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor!&#34; He blocked her route, wearing a smile he presumed charming and affectionate. &#34;Where are you headed? Let me drive you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes chilled with disdain as she replied, &#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her rejection, Jonny advanced. &#34;I heard you ended things with Nolan. If you allow it, I&#39;ll always wait for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the trending post disappeared quickly, Jonny had seen it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, it signaled a rare chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explained why he had rushed to linger outside the Benton family&#39;s villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor finally lifted her gaze, scanning him with icy contempt as if confronting something revolting. &#34;Are you worthy of me?&#34; she spat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her frigid stare, Jonny recalled past missteps and swallowed the words he almost uttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mocking smirk played across Eleanor&#39;s lips as she strode away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny went back to his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly had he opened the door when Vickie&#39;s sharp voice erupted from inside.&#34;What did you say? The trending poost I purchased got removed? Who did it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Jonny shut the door with a loud thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie jumped, almost dropping her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurriedly ended the call, forcing a tight smile. &#34;Jonny, welcome back. What would you like to eat? I can prepare it now!&#34; Jonny&#39;s gaze bore into her, closing the distance with every word. &#34;What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear gripped Vickie, and she stumbled back, too terrified to respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s patience snapped completely, and he barked, &#34;Speak!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body quivered violently under hiscommand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Vickie admitted she had hired trolls to circulate rumors online, claiming Eleanor was abandoned by Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The posts had barely spread before disappearing without a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury consumed Jonny, shaking him as his chest heaved. &#34;Mom, what have you been doing throughout the day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor now held the Benton family&#39;s affection as their prized daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could his mother dare target her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she deliberately trying to destroy them faster? Jonny couldn&#39;t comprehend it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie, realizing her plot was uncovered, felt partly justified. &#34;I... I did it for you! That woman caused so much trouble. I only wanted to vent and get revenge!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, she had committed no wrongdoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had disrupted Jonny&#39;s promising path, not the other way around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny nearly lost his mind at her foolishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sneered, &#34;Vent and get revenge? For what? Do you even understand that neither the Benton family,nor the Stewarts, nor Eleanor herself, are people we can afford to antagonize? And buying that post must have cost a fortune! Are you aware of our family&#39;s situation now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed impossible that they had struggled for so long, yet she behaved as though nothing had changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie couldn&#39;t tolerate the shame after her son shouted at her. She collapsed onto the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, &#34;Why are you yelling at me? Do you still care about that woman? Even if I die, I won&#39;t let you near her again! That woman is trouble!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny observed her tantrum with rising disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Continuing the argument seemed pointless; every syllable felt wasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Therefore, he opened the door and slammed it shut before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was alone in the empty corridor, Eleanor&#39;s frosty expression resurfaced in Jonny&#39;s mind, along with her dismissive words. &#34;Are you worthy of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Truly, he wasn&#39;t. From the moment he trusted Lainey and misjudged Eleanor three years ago, he had forfeited that right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization hit him-he would never regain her favor.</p>
