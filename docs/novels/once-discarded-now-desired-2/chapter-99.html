                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t guess what strategy Elepdon Museum would use to restore her reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What mattered most was that once their official statement went public, Myah would no longer be in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before that could happen, Eleanor knew she had to visit the Hope House and reassure Myah, sparing her from unnecessary anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined,Eleanor set out right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped up to the entrance of the Hope House, she was taken aback to see a fence now enclosing the once-vacant lot across the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the fenced area, construction workers were already hard at work, piecing together the frame of a new building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What really took her by surprise was spotting Vickie and Emma overseeing the whole project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was about to quietly slip past, but Emma intercepted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp click of Emma&#39;s heels echoed as she strode  up to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if it isn&#39;t the famous Enigma!&#34; Emma taunted.&#34;After all the mess you&#39;ve made for the Hope House,you still have the guts to show your face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waving her hand toward the construction site, Emma looked smug. &#34;Take a good look. The Todd Group is putting up a brand-new orphanage. Our family actually cares about these kids, unlike you. Once it&#39;s done, they&#39;ll have a real home and everything they need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd family was using charity as leverage, turning it into a weapon for personal gain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was taken aback by just how brazen the Todd family could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greed and self-interest seemed to be woven into everything the Todds did; genuine charity had never been part of their story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Eleanor saw no point in getting dragged into a pointless argument with Emma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to walk away, but Emma caught her,by the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay right there!&#34; Emma yelled, her voice ringing out.&#34;Everyone, look! It&#39;s Enigma herself! She evaded taxes and embezzled money from the Hope House!&#34; Emma&#39;s outburst was enough to make all the workers stop and stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paused, her gaze full of biting sarcasm as she faced them. &#34;Maybe try fixing your own family&#39;s scandals before pointing fingers. The Todd family have been pocketing funds from charity projects for a long time, and both you and your mother are fully aware of it,Emma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words cut with unmistakable force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when Vickie hurried over, pulling Emma away before things could escalate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie chimed in, her tone sharp. &#34;Emma, that&#39;s enough.Why bother getting into it with her right now?The Internet&#39;s already torn her apart-she&#39;s already being dragged through the mud. There&#39;s no point in arguing any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then added, &#34;Jonny believes that with Lainey backing us, our family is on the verge of making a name for itself. We should be polishing our reputation,not stirring up conflict. Do what your brother suggested and put your energy into building the orphanage instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Emma was itching to argue, she finally bit back her words. She shot Eleanor one last, venomous glare, then stalked off with her head held high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had no idea what plans the Todds wvere plotting, but she was certain their intentions weren&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, whatever it was didn&#39;t concern her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered herself and walked into the Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside, she delivered her prepared message to Myah.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Eleanor&#39;s reassurance, Myah finally let out a long sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She squeezed Eleanor&#39;s hand, her voice trembling with sadness. &#34;Eleanor, I&#39;m not worried about myself.What hurts is seeing everything you&#39;ve done for these children twisted by strangers. It&#39;s not fair to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor offered a gentle comfort. &#34;Don&#39;t worry,Myah.The museum will clear things up soon. I promise you,everything will work out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But until the truth was out, Myah knew peace would be hard to find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t want to make things harder for Eleanor,knowing how much she had already endured. Determined to put on a brave front, Myah straightened her shoulders and replied, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll trust you.&#34;</p>
