                <p>The crowd had already drifted inside the boutique,leaving the entrance quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stepped down from the stage, ready to follow them in, when a familiar presence stopped her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Trudy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a pale pink Atelier Veyron suit, she approached with her usual calm grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations on your opening, Eleanor,&#34; she said with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes swept over the boutique&#39;s glittering display of gowns before she added, &#34;The timing is perfect,actually. I&#39;ll be attending some important events with Nolan in the next few days, and I&#39;ll need a few formal gowns. Your designs are one of a kind, so l was hoping you could give me some recommendations.&#34; Betsy stood off to the side, her face tightening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy wasn&#39;t here to shop-she was here to stir trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to step forward and guide her out politely, but a clear, teasing voice interrupted from behind. &#34;Well, we can&#39;t have Enigma wasting her time on something so trivial, can we?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian appeared, striding forward in a striking red dress paired with sky-high heels, exuding self-assurance with every step.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked over Trudy, and she allowed herself a small,disdainful smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had just returned from Breoqua, already seething after hearing rumors about Fraser being set up on a blind date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not finding him there had left her on edge, and now seeing Eleanor cornered by Trudy only added fuel to her temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did this woman think she was, putting on air in front of Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to shut her down, Lillian stepped between the two women and introduced herself.&#34;Ms.White, I&#39;m Lillian Brooks, shareholder of Enigma Group. Dresses are my specialty, so if you need help,I&#39;ll be glad to assist you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy didn&#39;t flinch. Her smile remained as polished as ever. &#34;Ah; Ms. Brooks. I&#39;ve heard quite a bit about you. In that case, I&#39;d be grateful for your advice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor observed Lillian&#39;s eager approach with a flicker of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy had been calculating, while Lillian tended to act with fiery impulsiveness, traits that didn&#39;t blend well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly, Eleanor leaned toward Betsy and murmured, &#34;Keep an eye on them. Make sure Lillian doesn&#39;t get outmaneuvered.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, boss,&#34; Betsy said with a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But trouble wasn&#39;t far off. In her usual blunt fashion, Lillian steered the conversation toward Trudy and Nolan&#39;s arranged marriage, pointedly warning her not to meddle where she didn&#39;t belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trudy, however, wasn&#39;t about to back down. She raised her voice, clear enough for anyone nearby to hear. &#34;Ms. Brooks, I&#39;m just here to shop, nothing more. No need to treat me likean enemy. Besides,I&#39;ve already promised Nolan that after we marry, I&#39;ll make sure Eleanor is treated kindly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unspoken message was clear that she was the &#34;rightful&#34; partner, magnanimnous and above petty jealousy, leaving Eleanor, the supposed mistress,untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People around them exchanged uneasy glances.Wait, was Enigma, the celebrated designer, suddenly Nolan&#39;s mistress?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had just witnessed Eleanor and Nolan openly showing their affection not long ago, and now here came Trudy, claiming to be the legitimate fiancée. The timing felt almost comically cruel, like fate was having a laugh at everyone&#39;s expense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s anger flared at Trudy&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and Nolan had history; they were the original pair. And Trudy, an intruder, had the audacity to act so generous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to snap, but Eleanor gently tugged at her to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping in front of Lillian, Eleanor faced Trudy calmly. &#34;Ms. White, I don&#39;t know why you agreed to marry Nolan, but the fact is, Nolan and I announced our engagement before you. Lillian isn&#39;t wrong. By every measure, you&#39;re the intruder here. Just because you have Norwood in your corner doesn&#39;t mean you can distort the facts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor rarely went into such detail, but today was different. She had to call out Trudy&#39;s hypocrisy, and quickly, before Lillian got caught in the crossfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Lillian was standing up for her, and she fail her friend.</p>
