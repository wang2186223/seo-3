                <p>Jonny&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on the officer&#39;s back until he disappeared, his jaw aching from how tightly he ground his teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forget it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company came first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t risk creating another storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slamming his fists against his thighs, he flagged down a cab and rode straight to the Todd family&#39;s estate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had always shown deference to Sallie-maybe his grandmother could convince her to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his shock, the second he voiced his plan, Sallie&#39;s palm cracked hard across his face. &#34;This entire mess is your doing. How dare you bring it up again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow landed with all the force of her conviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman who had built her life on principle could not stomach a grandson incapable of telling right from wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her, it was nothing short of disgrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reeling from the slap, Jonny bit back any defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead,he dropped to his knees and clung desperately to her legs. &#34;Grandma, please! Eleanor is already close to Mr. Stewart, and because of that, he&#39;s pulled his investment from us. I&#39;m terrified that once I marry Lainey, Eleanor will lash out again and drag the Todd Group down even further. If she doesn&#39;t return to me,our company will collapse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s voice dropped to a pleading softness. &#34;Grandma, please think of the company&#39;s future!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he didn&#39;t truly believe Eleanor had caused the Stewart Group to pull out. But he knew Sallie wouldn&#39;t budge unless he painted her as the reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He doubted a man like Nolan would ever seriously want a divorced woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie&#39;s chest tightened as fury rose. &#34;Shut up! The Stewart Group left because of your mistakes. Eleanor had nothing to do with it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had lived long enough to see through people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandson&#39;s intentions were as clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny simply couldn&#39;t stand watching Eleanor live well, and he wanted to keep both women at his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That selfishness would ruin their family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaustion crept over her as she pressed her fingers to her temples. With a tired wave toward the servant,she murmured, &#34;Take me back to my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after she retreated to her room, Sallie&#39;s thoughts refused to settle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rumors about the Todd Group&#39;s troubles had already reached her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The investment from the Stewart Group had been vital to keeping the company afloat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without it, the Todd Group truly risked collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her heart, Sallie knew Eleanor wasn&#39;t the kind of woman to strike from the shadows-she was too straightforward, too decent for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Jonny&#39;s words lingered. If Eleanor really had drawn close to Nolan, perhaps that connection wasn&#39;t without meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, just maybe, there was still a thread of hope to grasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea of watching the Todd family&#39;s legacy crumble after decades was unbearable. Pride might have to be sacrificed for the sake of survival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, Sallie turned to the servant and gave her instructions. &#34;Reach out to Eleanor. Tell herI&#39;d like to see her for a meal-that I miss her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor received the call, she was caught off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie was no ordinary woman. With Eleanor&#39;s ties to Jonny strained beyond repair, it seemed unlikely the invitation was out of simple affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Sallie truly trying to speak for Jonny?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t fit her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie wasn&#39;t the type to meddle in such a way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying her doubts with her, Eleanor still went to the meeting the following day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the head of the table sat Sallie, already waiting, her face softened by a welcoming smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her eyes fell on Eleanor, her expression grew even warmer, and she gestured gently. &#34;Eleanor,come closer. Let me really see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obeying,Eleanor took the seat beside her and wrapped her hands around Sallie&#39;s slightly frail ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sallie, I...&#34; She faltered, her voice laced with guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The divorce from Jonny had surely hurt Sallie most of all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading her look without difficulty, Sallie let out a quiet sigh and patted her hand. &#34;All I care about is whether you&#39;ve been treated fairly. Jonny was the one in the wrong, not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of gratitude washed through Eleanor at those words. Even among family,such fairness was rare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest warmed as she gave Sallie&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze. &#34;Thank you for thinking of me, Sallie.&#34;</p>
