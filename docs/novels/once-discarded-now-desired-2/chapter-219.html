                <p>On the flight home,Eleanor slipped away to freshen up,eager to wash off the exhaustion from the trip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned a few minutes later,settling comfortably into her seat before turning her attention to the man beside her. &#34;So, how did things play out with the Fist Guild?&#34; she asked, curiosity flickering in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes drifted open, and he gently enclosed her cool hand within the warmth of his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A touch of drowsiness lingered in his voice. &#34;The Fist Guild carries great influence in Zerovia. If it were to fall apart, the gangs would splinter into factions,and the disorder that followed would stir up even greater trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued, &#34;The woman who runs the Fist Guild actually has her head on straight. She handed back all their ill-gotten gains, trying to make peace before things could turn ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, then pulled a file from his bag and handed it over. &#34;We even ended up with a bonus out of all this.&#34; With a puzzled look, Eleanor opened the folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, a bank statement showed a sea of transactions,but one transfer from the Benton Group jumped out: one hundred million, clear as day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s expression iced over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t need to ask. Lainey&#39;s fingerprints were all over this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embezzling funds on this scale was unbelievable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shutting the file with a quiet snap,Eleanor leveled her gaze at Nolan, a hint of a smirk curling her lips.&#34;Funny,you mention unexpected bonuses. I&#39;ve got one of my own,&#34; she said, waving her phone. &#34;I found a stash of photos from Lainey&#39;s wild days in Horace&#39;s lounge.Let&#39;s just say she won&#39;t want anyone seeing these.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plane touched down at Elepdon Airport before sunrise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had they stepped off the jet than someone rushed toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian threw her arms around Eleanor, clutching her tightly. &#34;Eleanor! I thought I&#39;d lost you for good,&#34; she cried, her voice thick with emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland dragged himself along at the rear, exhaustion  written all over his face and dark shadows under his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about the last few days had been easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Nolan gone to Zerovia to rescue Eleanor, every responsibility for the Stewart Group had fallen on his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Endless paperwork kept him busy from dawn to dusk,and to make matters worse, Besty kept storming the Stewart family&#39;s manor, demanding Eleanor&#39;s return and turning every day into a circus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland fixed Nolan with a look that mixed relief and exasperation. &#34;You&#39;re finally/ back. I thought I&#39;d never see the end of this mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Ryland vented his frustration, Nolan&#39;s gaze moved to Lillian, who clung to Eleanor like she might never let go. His eyes narrowed ever so slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having just pulled Eleanor out of real danger,Nolan wasn&#39;t about to let anyone else keep her out of his reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasted no time. Reaching out, he disentangled Eleanor from Lillian&#39;s grasp and pulled her firmly into his own arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor needs to rest. I&#39;lI be taking her home now,&#34;he said, tone brooking no argument and leaving no  room for protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Nolan tossed a folder straight at Ryland. &#34;Take this to the Benton family&#39;s estate. Give it to Jeff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland accepted his fate with a heavy sense of inevitability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the document still in his hand, he watched the couple leave and felt a sinking certainty that his long days of exhaustion were far from ending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He carried the name of the Brooks family, and he could not understand how Nolan could treat him as if he were of so little worth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian watched in confusion, still processing the abrupt handoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she had wanted was to check on Eleanor. What did Nolan have against her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon returning to the villa in Regal Heights, Nolan held his pillow and stubbornly trailed Eleanor all the way to the third floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He claimed he had missed her so much, the thought of being apart again left him uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of annoyance flickered in Eleanor&#39;s eyes before her expression softened. &#34;Alright, but I&#39;m sleeping in  my own bed. The guest room&#39;s all yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t having it. &#34;If you&#39;re in the bed, I&#39;m at least sleeping on your floor. I&#39;m not leaving you alone tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the needles near her bedside and considered how much he had been through.Reluctantly, she gave in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When night fell, Nolan went all out, pulling out every card he had, all the car keys, even offering up the deeds to his properties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spreading the documents across the bed, he gave her a hopeful, almost sheepish look. &#34;Eleanor,everything I have is yours if you just let me sleep next to you tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t so much as flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one glance at his display, Eleanor slid under the covers and turned away. &#34;Goodnight. I&#39;m exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing she wouldn&#39;t budge, Nolan took the hint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed a blanket and settled down on the floor beside her bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was, a billionaire sprawled on the floor,sighing. Winning Eleanor&#39;s heart would never be simple, no matter how much he offered.</p>
