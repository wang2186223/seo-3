                <p>Darleen made her way to pick up the contract,keeping herself disguised from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Lainey knew her too well. The minute the receptionist sent over a clip from the lobby cameras,Lainey recognized Darleen with barely a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So it was Darleen. That bitch. If she wanted trouble,she had found it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred boiled in Lainey&#39;s chest as she snapped her phone shut and wasted no time dialing Horace. &#34;I want Darleen Faulkner handled. She&#39;s in Elepdon right now. Take care of her for me, and I&#39;ll add 2% to your cut when it&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace lived outside the law. Jobos like this were just another day for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He saw the upside, so he didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;Alright,&#34;he  responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Darleen had no clue what was brewing behind her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the law firm with a spring in her step, feeling like the world had just handed her a crown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the authentic share transfer papers, she could hardly believe her luck. She had just secured a fortune, and nobody in the Faulkner family could look down on her now. The future was hers-she would be the one calling the shots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her triumph, Darleen never saw the danger coming. A coarse sack landed over her head out of nowhere,cutting off her vision in a blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within seconds, she was shoved into a waiting van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the timne the sack was removed, she was choking on the smell of dust and decay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around and realized she had been dumped in a derelict factory. Rough ropes dug into her wrists and ankles, leaving her completely at the  mercy of her captors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Footsteps echoed through the emptiness as a burly man stalked toward her, a wicked-looking knife catching the light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Terror took over, making her voice shake. &#34;Who are you? What do you want from me? I&#39;m from the Faulkner family! If you lay a finger on me, you&#39;ll regret it-my family won&#39;t let this slide!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man only laughed, flashing a mouth full of stained teeth. His eyes glinted with cruel amusement. &#34;Faulkner, huh? That&#39;s exactly why you&#39;re here. You crossed the wrong person,sweetheart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind raced as she tried to make sense of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only one name came to mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be that snake. So she was willing to go this far? That two-faced bitch had betrayed her without a second thought!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Darleen stayed quiet, the man smirked -he could tell she had pieced everything together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without warning, he tossed a notepad and pen at her feet. &#34;Go on, write a confession. Say Eleanor Warren kidnappedyou and planned to kill you for money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen recoiled in horror. &#34;No, absolutely not!Eleanor is with Nolan. If he hears about this, I&#39;m finished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clearly had no interest in hearing her protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dark chuckle, he slashed through the rope around her wrists and pressed the cold blade against her neck. &#34;You&#39;ve got two options. Write what I told you,or you won&#39;t leave this place alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knife dug into her skin, and warm blood trickled down her neck, sending a jolt of pain straight through her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having lived a sheltered life, Darleen had never faced  anything so terrifying. Fear took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice shook as she surrendered. &#34;I-I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands barely stopped trembling as she gripped the pen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each word took everything out of her, and it was a long,agonizing few minutes before she managed to scrawl the forced confession across the page.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Darleen finished scribbling, the man yanked the notepad from her grasp with barely contained impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scanned her shaky handwriting, lips curling into a satisfied grin once he saw everything was in order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw that, Darleen&#39;s voice broke as she tried to bargain. &#34;I did what you asked. Can I leave now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response was a mocking snicker. &#34;Do you think I&#39;ll let you off so easily?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Darleen stammered,  confusion clouding her features. Panic surged as realization dawned in her wide, terrified eyes. &#34;Wait,you&#39;re not-no, don&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She never got to plead for mercy. The man&#39;s blade flashed,striking before she could react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bound and helpless, she had no way to run. Agony ripped through her, hot and sharp, as the blood drained from her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her vision blurred. Somewhere in the haze, she heard the man&#39;s voice, low and businesslike, making a call to Horace to confirm the job was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that,everything faded into black.</p>
