                <p>The situation was spinning completely out of control, and Besty could only watch in stunned silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t begin to understand how things had escalated so far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from the second floor, Eleanor had a clear view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her boss wasn&#39;t moving a finger, Besty knew she couldn&#39;t either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned, she decided to walk away, leaving the mess behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upstairs, Lillian was fuming. &#34;Eleanor! Did you see that? She admitted it on purpose. Shouldn&#39;t we expose her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head, calm and collected. &#34;Expose her and reveal my identity? That&#39;s pointless. She&#39;s not important enough to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simply put, Lainey wasn&#39;t even worth Eleanor&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s annoyance melted into adoration. On impulse, she leaned in and planted a kiss on Eleanor&#39;s cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Eleanor darted away, escaping her playful affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the competition wrapped up, two hashtags had already exploded across social media:#EnigmaldentityExposed and #EnigmaGroup&#39;sDesignCompetition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After years of mystery, the public finally believed they had caught a glimpse of the elusive Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fans went wild, flooding Twitter until servers nearly buckled under the traffic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny,however, was even more thrilled than the fans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He put down his phone, pulled Lainey close, and held her tightly, pressing a passionate kiss to her lips.&#34;Lainey, I&#39;ll be good to you from now on,&#34; he promised. Enigma!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wife was Enigma, the legendary designer, unattainable to all, yet standing right here beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief and pride swelled in him, knowing the company&#39;s troubles would be behind him and that humiliation was no longer looming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey secretly rolled her eyes, hiding her disdain behind a delicate act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She acted shy, giving him a gentle push while speaking softly.&#34;JOnny, you&#39;re hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The plea melted him instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip eased, and Lainey nestled closer, tracing lazy circles across his chest. &#34;Seeing you so happy makes me happy too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, her eyes shimmering with fake tenderness, &#34;But now that everyone knows who I really am,staying as your secretary might spark gossip. And I heard the CFO is retiring soon. so...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the words hang, because the pause was louder than anything she could have said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jonny, unwilling to let her down, nodded immediately. &#34;I&#39;ll handle it with HR right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, Lainey.no longer had the patience to fuss over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rewarded him with a chaste kiss on the cheek and said, &#34;No need to rush. I need a break too. The fans have kept me occupied all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,she swept upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut, her gentle facade disappeared entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had consistently treated her well, she might have spared herself the ruthlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But knowing he still had feelings for Eleanor and had repeatedly belittled her for that stoked a fire within Lainey. She was determined he would pay for his ignorance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, before turning her attention toward the Todd Group, she knew she had to cement her public persona as Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smirk crossed her face as she drafted a post. &#34;Everything&#39;s aligning perfectly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alongside it, she shared a side-profile photo of herself taken backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dim lighting softened her smile, making it gentle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To the fans, the tweet seemed like proof that she really was Enigma, and almost immediately the online community exploded with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow, Enigma,you&#39;re stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re like a living fairy! Absolutely enchanting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew it! Lainey is Enigma! That quiet strength in her eyes. It&#39;s unmistakable!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey leaned back, savoring the chaos she had sparked. These frantic admirers were so easy to sway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, her phone started buzzing with private messages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were all from Elepdon&#39;s high-society young women, who usually acted superior to everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma, please, I need a custom gown! Name your price!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I wear one of your pieces for my birthday next month? I&#39;ll pay anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes glittered with disdain as she scrolled through the groveling messages. They were nothing more than self-important sycophants now reduced to pleading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exactly the effect she.had intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet. With a dismissive flick of her wrist, she set her phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had no intention of responding. Not everyone deserved her attention, not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her status as Enigma placed her far above these petty admirers.</p>
