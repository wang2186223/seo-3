                <p>At a hospital, Darleen was a mess of nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clutched at the nurse&#39;s white coat like her life depended on it. &#34;Please, call Eleanor for me! Or Nolan...anyone! I&#39;ll repay you, I swear!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to get the truth out before it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was a monster. She had swapped the DNA samples, stolen Eleanor&#39;s identity, and was after the Benton family&#39;s legacy. Her ruined state was all her doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse flinched at Darleen&#39;s wild grip, her wrist turning red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This woman had just woken up from a coma. Maybe she wasn&#39;t in her right mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down,&#34; the nurse murmured, trying to pry herself free. &#34;I&#39;ll get the doctor, just wait...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door swung open, and before she couId even register who had walked in, two men in black suits grabbed her and shoved her aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut behind them with a heavy thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey walked up to Darleen, twirling her freshly painted nails like she had all the time in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Darleen saw her face, her heart nearly stopped. Her pupils shrank, and her body trembled violently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This devil had come back to finish her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey smirked at the pale, weak woman on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, well. Who would&#39;ve guessed you had such a stubborn will to live? Even after rotting away like a vegetable, you still managed to crawl back.&#34; Darleen&#39;s hands shook as she fumbled for the glass of water on the bedside table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised it with all the courage she could muster. &#34;Stay back!&#34; Her voice cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey actually laughed. To her, this little show of resistance was pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even bother with her usual sweet act anymore-the malice in her eyes was raw and bare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what?&#34; Lainey&#39;s voice had that cruel sing-song edge, like she was about to share a juicy secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor&#39;s dead. Burned to ashes in the Benton villa. And the Bentons? They&#39;re finished too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen&#39;s thoughts froze, her head ringing as if struck, the words refusing to make sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor...dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No,that wasn&#39;t possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at Lainey in horror, her shock pushing aside even her fear. &#34;Was it you? Didyou kill them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey let out a laugh, merciless and cruel, the kind that could cut through skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence radiated off her, and why wouldn&#39;t it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she would be Nolan&#39;s wife, holding power over both the Benton and the Stewart families.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that kind of future waiting for her, what risk was there in taunting a dying woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So what if it was me?&#34; She sneered. &#34;There&#39;s nothing left that can pin it on me anyway. And you know the best part?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned down, enjoying the fear in Darleen&#39;s eyes before twisting the knife further with her words.&#34;You won&#39;t be around much longer to tell anyone. Soon, you&#39;ll be gone too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mocking smile fell away, replaced by a chilling coldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,she slipped a dagger from her handbag, its blade catching the dim light with a cruel gleam. Step by step, she closed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen&#39;s breath hitched, her body trembling as she tried to shrink back. &#34;NNo...stay away!&#34; But she had only just woken from months of stillness. Her body was weak, fragile, and useless against the storm standing before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey didn&#39;t hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lunged and drove the dagger deep into Darleen&#39;s stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wet,sickening sound filled the room as blood burst out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen cried out, the glass slipping from her hand and shattering against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey wasn&#39;t finished. Her fury boiled over, and she stabbed again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this woman hadn&#39;t existed, none of her plans would have gone wrong. Her rage fueled her arm as she stabbed without restraint, convinced Darleen deserved every ounce of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panting, she grabbed a fistful of Darleen&#39;s hair, yanking her head back, and dragged the blade across her pale face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One cut, then another, until the features were gone, replaced by a mask of blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she stepped back, with a sick grin stretching her lips. Victory had never tasted sweeter.</p>
