                <p>Nolan spent the entire night reading the romance guidebook, searching for a way to make things right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By sunrise, inspiration struck-he would redo the proposal, but this time, he would change the entire scene and let the world see just how much Eleanor meant to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wanted everyone, especially her fans, to witness the love that had been so real during their first engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Energized by the plan, Nolan dove headfirst into preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Days slipped by without a word from him, leaving Eleanor to wonder if he was still busy keeping Elora company. That thougt weighed heavy, making her feel even more alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing her daughter&#39;s gloom, Hilda gently brushed Eleanor&#39;s hair aside and gave her a warm smile.&#34;You&#39;ve been locked up at home for too long. How about we go out for some shopping and clear your head?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor agreed, thinking some time out with Hilda  might lift her spirits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They headed downtown, ending up at the city&#39;s largest mall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lavish boutique with gold trim and floor-to-ceiling windows caught Hilda&#39;s attention, and she tugged Eleanor toward the entrance. &#34;This place looks interesting. Let&#39;s pop in for a look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Eleanor was about to step through the doors,she spotted two familiar faces reflected in the glass -Ady and Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Elora knelt at Ady&#39;s feet, slipping shoes onto her with careful hands, looking for all the world like a servant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight left Eleanor stunned, and her face fell. Hilda immediately noticed the change. &#34;Sweetie, are you feeling okay? Did something happen?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shook her head and quickly took her mother&#39;s hand. &#34;Mom, I think I need to sit down for a bit. Can you come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hilda could answer, Eleanor hurried her away from the store, doing her best to avoid being seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor settled into a coffee shop, her thoughts spinning in a hundred directions. So Elora was working for Ady all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That nagging unease finally made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Elora hadn&#39;t crossed any lines, careful never to slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would Nolan even believe her if she spoke up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or would he brush it off as jealousy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made Eleanor pause. Maybe she needed proof. Turning to Hilda, she improvised. &#34;Mom, I think I dropped my earring. Can you wait here for me a second?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Hilda could reply, Eleanor was already halfway out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Hilda looked after her, puzzled but patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor raced back toward the boutique, clutching her phone, ready to snap a picture. But when she peeked inside,Ady and Elora had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a sigh, deciding not to dwell on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, she trusted that Nolan was nobody&#39;s fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Elora had hidden motives, he would figure it out on his own. And really, without any evidence, what could she even say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Hilda found her lingering by the storefront,lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor perked up and looped her arm through her mother&#39;s, forcing a smile. &#34;Mom, I&#39;m starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s eyes softened, her concern melting into a warm laugh. &#34;Perfect timing! There&#39;s a new place nearby everyone&#39;s raving about. Let&#39;s go spoil ourselves a little,&#34; she replied,her tone light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor nodded, matching her mother&#39;s pace as they walked side by side toward the restaurant.</p>
