                <p>By the following morning, word had already spread through Elepdon&#39;s upper circles that Stewart Group was injecting funds back into the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny practically bounced off the couch, the dark cloud that had been weighing him down evaporating in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could hardly believe it. What he had tossed out as an offhand comment to win Sallie&#39;s sympathy had,against all odds, turned into a lifeline for the Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a windfall!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he had been right after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor might act cold, but her heart was still tied to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why else would she have spoken up on behalf of the Todd Group the moment Sallie opened her mouth?No, it wasn&#39;t about business-it had to be about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must still be hopelessly in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rush of satisfaction swelled in Jonny&#39;s chest, so fierce it nearly made him laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snatching up his phone, he instructed Allard the moment the call connected. &#34;Arrange a private office for Eleanor. I want her back at the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the line went dead, he muttered smugly, &#34;If she&#39;s this devoted, I&#39;ll throw her a rope. But the title of my wife? That belongs to Lainey,always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not far away, Sallie gave a sharp, derisive chuckle.&#34;Delusions. After everything you&#39;ve done, you really think Eleanor would stiIl look twice at you? That girl&#39;s heart is pure, but you trampled on it when you had the chance. You can&#39;t rewind the past,Jonny.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried the weight of disappointment. If Jonny weren&#39;t the sole heir, the Todd Group would never have landed in his hands. With a heavy sigh, Sallie pushed herself up,retreating slowly to her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What she didn&#39;t realize was that Lainey, standing quietly by the entrance, had heard every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That decrepit woman...always defending Eleanor!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did Eleanor have that she didn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a pitiful little orphan with no background, no family name. Strip away her looks, and there was nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet Sallie insisted on holding her up like a jewel,even after the divorce, still clinging to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now Jonny, too, wanted her back in Todd Group?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, he hadn&#39;t let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey ground her teeth. Fortunately, Eleanor had grown arrogant lately. With luck, she wouldn&#39;t agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Otherwise, forcing her out again would be far messier. Jonny, ignorant of Lainey&#39;s plotting, left for the office not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Stewart Group&#39;s capital back in play, the company needed immediate attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his rush, he didn&#39;t even notice Lainey standing the garden as he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had planned to stage a coincidental run-in with him in the garden, but being brushed off without so much as a glance made her stomp the grass in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to storm off when a frantic voice rang out from upstairs. &#34;Mrs. Todd! Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey froze, then smirked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another episode, was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Serves the old woman right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this... this could be useful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she played the role of the concerned daughter-in-law, she might just worm her way deeper into Sallie&#39;s good graces and into her shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on her sweetest mask, she dashed inside.&#34;Sallie!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bedroom door stood wide open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie was sprawled on the floor, her skin ashen and lips pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Lainey stepped in, the maid blurted out in a rush, &#34;Miss Gilbert, thank heavens you&#39;re here!Mrs. Todd&#39;s having another attack. I&#39;ll get her back to bed, and you grab the medicine from the drawer,quick!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey bristled at the command, loathing the idea of being bossed around by a servant. Still, she forced a smile and nodded. &#34;Of course, I&#39;ll get it right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strode to the bedside drawer, pulled it open, and her eyes immediately landed on a brown glass bottle with a neatly printed label. This had to be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted it, then hesitated. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the maid supporting Sallie back onto the mattress, blocking the old woman&#39;s view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of cruelty flashed across Lainey&#39;s eyes. In that brief moment, she slipped the bottle to the farthest corner, sliding a box on top to hide it completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sallie had always treated her like dirt, poisoning Jonny&#39;s mind and keeping him from marrying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she dropped dead tonight, that barrier would be gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she survived, then fate was simply being kind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feigning panic, she rattled through the drawer noisily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid, now sweating as Sallie&#39;s condition worsened, snapped, &#34;Miss Gilbert, haven&#39;t you found it yet? It&#39;s always at the front-you couldn&#39;t possibly miss it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey glanced over her shoulder, widening her eyes as if flustered. &#34;I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s not here. Maybe Sallie tucked it away somewhere when she was organizing her things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid faltered, torn by doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sallie had already slumped unconscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid&#39;s hands shook. Without the medicine,Sallie&#39;s life could be at risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abandoning Lainey, she tore into the drawer herself,rummaging until she finally pulled out the bottle buried at the very back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands shook as she hurried to administer the dose, but the delay had already stolen precious minutes.Sallie remained unresponsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid&#39;s throat tightened. &#34;This... this is terrible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret burned through her chest. If she had searched instead of wasting time relying on Lainey,Sallie wouldn&#39;t be at death&#39;s door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked as she called for help. &#34;Butler! Call an ambulance</p>
