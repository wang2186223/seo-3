                <p>Backstage at the Regal Hotel, Eleanor was putting the finishing touches on her look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The makeup team had just packed up and left, leaving her alone in the airy, quiet room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, her phone buzzed with a call from Hilda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expecting a routine call, maybe some last-minute instructions, she answered with a polite smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; she said, but no one answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence, except for a faint, unsettling sizzling, like something was burning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s smile vanished, and an uneasy tension gripped her chest.&#34;Mrs. Benton? Are you okay?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sizzling didn&#39;t stop. If anything, it seemed to get louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic-stricken, she stood up and began pacing, trying to calm herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Benton! Can you hear me?&#34; she shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasting no time, she grabbed her phone, tugged at the hem of her gown, and rushed to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she swung it open, she bumped into a soft figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey, dressed in a bubblegum-pink gown, stepped back a few paces, but her composure didn&#39;t waver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fixed her hair and planted herself squarely in Eleanor&#39;s path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, where do you think you&#39;re going? The engagement party&#39;s about to starrt she&#39;said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t have a second to waste on pleasantries. She tried to push past her, but Lainey didn&#39;t move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly,her voice softened, yet a sharp edge remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone is truly pathetic. On what should be the happiest day of her lives, she ends up grieving. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s sad,Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for barely a heartbeat, then spun around, her eyes cold and furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t say a word and slapped Lainey hard, knocking her to the floor as her cheek puffed up and reddened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lainey could even think, Eleanor crouched beside her and gripped her neck tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell have you done?&#34; Eleanor growled through clenched teeth. &#34;What did you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey struggled for air, her face bright red, but her lips curled intoa cruel smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She thrived on pushing Eleanor&#39;s buttons.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I mean?&#34; she sneered. &#34;Do you really not understand? I had someone swap our DNA samples, and Hilda, that careful old woman, and Jeff, that fool, actually believed it! They actually believed I was their real daughter! And now, all of this... it&#39;s their own doing. Their mistake. Their blind trust. And if you hurry over to their home now, you might just catch a final glimpse of them. Tick-tock, my dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word hit Eleanor like a punch to the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic bubbled up as Hilda&#39;s kind, loving face flashed in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really be true? Were the Bentons truly her real parents?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands and feet went icy, and her eyes reddened without her realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fixing Lainey with a sharp gaze, Eleanor hissed, &#34;If anything happens to them, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, without another word, she let go and bolted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey stayed sprawled on the floor, but that twisted smirk never left her face. Perfect timing. Eleanor was running straight into her trap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her sore neck and grinned wickedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, before Horace was dealt with, he had stationed some men in the countryside who would follow orders for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t even expected Nolan to be this relentless about marrying Eleanor, and she certainly didn&#39;t think Norwood would dare set Wray&#39;s appointment as general manager today. Yet the engagement was still going on as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was maddening and exhilarating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s grin widened,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan would be hers, and anyone in her way, Eleanor, the Bentons, well, they could all burn.</p>
