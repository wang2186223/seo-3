                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t even stop to think. She just snatched her jacket, flew down the stairs, and nearly collided with Nola.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless,she stammered, &#34;You...why are you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t get to finish. He pulled her straight into his arms and held her so tightly that she was able to feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin restedlightly on her hair, his breath brushing her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he finally let her go,his voice was soft but sure.&#34;Safe travels. And don&#39;t forget to miss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked. That was it? He had come all the way here just to say something like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was torn between laughter and exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan really was hopeless-an unapologetic romantic through and through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few words, she returned upstairs,collapsed into bed, and slept straight through without  a single dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, she was on her way to the airport with Dyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped out of the car, chaos erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,look this way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor,are you really Butterfly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m such a big fan,Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The endless shouting was starting to drill into Eleanor&#39;s skull, each cheer making her temples throb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Dyer, who was soaking in the attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glare could have set fire to him, but the old man only raised his brows in smug amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a booming laugh, he lifted a hand for silence,and to her disbelief, the chaotic noise melted into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearing his throat with exaggerated gravity, he announced in a mock-serious tone, &#34;The only thing you all need to know is that she is my most prized student. As for Butterfly, or whatever name you&#39;re tossing around, I&#39;ve never even heard of such a person.&#34; His explanation was so half-hearted it practically dripped with insincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the words left his mouth, the crowd burst into laughter, booing and tossing playful jabs his way,clearly amused by the flimsy denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Dyer, who&#39;d believe that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly, that&#39;s basically admitting it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Confirmed! Enigma is Butterfly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the shouts grew louder and the path ahead clogged with eager fans, Dyer grabbed Eleanor&#39;s wrist and made a break for the terminal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just before disappearing inside, he turned and barked,&#34;I never admitted anything! Remember, this is all your own wild speculation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the plane took off smoothly and things calmed down, Dyer leaned back in his seat, looking very pleased with himself. He shot Eleanor a sideways grin,smug as ever. &#34;So? Pretty smooth, right? Didn&#39;t I handle that just fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gave him a flat look, his playful tone not surprising her in the least.Without a word, she unlocked her phone, pulled up the trending topics, and handed it over to him. &#34;Want to see what people are saying online?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still wearing that self-satisfied smile, Dyer took the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment his eyes landed on the glaring headline, his grin stiffened. &#34;Dyer confirms Butterfly is Enigma at the airport.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He skimmed the articles, saw the flood of giddy comments, and though his eyes lit with amusement,he still muttered with annoyance, &#34;Ridiculous! These shameless reporters! They&#39;re just lying through their teeth, twisting every word! Just wait till I&#39;m back from Otrad, I&#39;m suing every last one of them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor calmly took her phone back, propped her chin in her hand, and chose silence over fueling his theatrics.</p>
