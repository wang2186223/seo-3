                <p>Because her workload was unpredictable, Eleanor had never once opened reservations for Enigma gowns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s knack for fabricating lies with a straight face seemed to sharpen by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the women in the room had never even laid eyes on an authentic Enigma piece, much less understood the designer&#39;s rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That ignorance quickly turned into open hostility toward Eleanor. Disdain flickered across painted faces, and whispers turned sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just an abandoned wife from some orphanage. What could you possibly know about high fashion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly-how dare you spout nonsense here and  accuse Lainey of lying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But not everyone swallowed Lainey&#39;s claim so easily.A few had enough knowledge to hesitate, and Darleen was one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her confident smile wavered, as though something tugged at the back of her mind. &#34;Now that I think about it... Enigma doesn&#39;t allow pre-orders. When l was planning my birthday, my mother and | casually asked...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen&#39;s words faltered, the last note uncertain,before her eyes landed on Lainey with a flicker of doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she really have been fooled?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she had vouched for Lainey, snuck her into this very party, and gone out of her way to polish her reputation. If Lainey was bluffing, her credibility would shatter with hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subtle crack in Darleen&#39;s tone was all it took. A ripple spread through the circle, voices dropping,  expressions shifting. One by one, people began to second-guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Lainey really be a liar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat crawled up Lainey&#39;s neck, her nails biting into her palms until they nearly broke skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn that Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A blind strike, yet it landed perfectly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she didn&#39;t turn this around, her footing in these circles would crumble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a steadying breath, she lifted her chin,forcing her eyes to glisten as though she were on the verge of tears. &#34;Miss Warren, I understand you resent me because of Jonny, but does that mean you can invent lies to smear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice wavered delicately, the hint of a sob timed to perfection. &#34;The truth is, years ago,I had the good fortune to meet Besty Juarez. When she learned I was getting married, she personally made an exception for me. Tell me, is that so wrong?&#34; Gasps stirred the crowd. Besty was one of Enigma&#39;s top executives, a woman so rarely seen in public she was practically a legend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could Lainey truly have ties to someone like her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darleen&#39;s doubt melted instantly, her eyes lighting up with sudden excitement. She rushed forward and clasped Lainey&#39;s hand, her earlier hesitation forgotten. &#34;Lainey, why didn&#39;t you say so before? You actually know Besty Juarez? I&#39;m preparing for my engagement soon-please,you must introduce me to her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Darleen spoke, the others quickly swarmed closer, their voices rising in eager chorus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right, Lainey, we&#39;re all your friends-you can&#39;t leave us out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, you&#39;re too lovely and generous to refuse us.You&#39;ll introduce us too, won&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The chorus of flattery washed over her, and a faint gleam of triumph flickered in Lainey&#39;s eyes.  But beneath that thin layer of pride, panic churned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no connection to Besty at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What excuse could possibly save her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she slipped, the lie would come crashing down on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression twisted between smugness and fear,emotions flashing so quickly across her face they almost tripped over one another. From a distance,Lillian folded her arms, smirking. &#34;Eleanor, look at her -Lainey&#39;s face is doing backflips.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor barely registered Lillian&#39;s words, her mind snagging on something else entirely. Her stomnach tightened-Nolan was watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the second-floor balcony, he leaned against a pillar, red wine in hand, his figure framed by the warm light above. He was devastatingly handsome,but that wasn&#39;t what made her pulse quicken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was his eyes. The steady, unflinching weight of his gaze was so deep it felt as though he could peel  back her every defense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s pulse stumbled, and without giving Lillian a chance to babble further, she seized her friend by the wrist and pulled her straight into the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slammed shut behind them, the lock snapping into place with a sharp click.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Eleanor out of his sight, Nolan finally allowed his gaze to drift away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile ghosted across his lips as he lowered himself with practiced ease onto a circular couch nearby, every movement steeped in unhurried confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the side, Erick stepped forward, document folder in hand. His tone was deferential. &#34;Mr.Stewart,the team has already begun construction. Hope House will be relocated soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan scanned through the papers with little comment, though a flicker of thought shadowed his expression. Was it coincidence, or had Lillian and Eleanor displayed an oddly precise knowledge of Enigma&#39;s internal rules?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the file, he leaned back, long fingers drumming lightly against the armrest. &#34;Look into Enigma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick blinked, startled by the sudden order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would Nolan concern himself with a women&#39;s fashion house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be... was he planning to surprise Eleanor with something extravagant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought stirred, but he kept his face composed and answered steadily, &#34;Understood, Mr. Stewart. I&#39;ll see to it at once,&#34;</p>
