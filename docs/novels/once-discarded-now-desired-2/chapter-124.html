                <p>Friday arrived, bringing with it the exclusive event at Ashford Gallery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A private art show was quietly unfolding,reserved for the city&#39;s most prominent elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey stepped inside, her eyes landed on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found Eleanor absorbed in an impressionist canvas, her focus unbroken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luck seemed to be tipping in Lainey&#39;s favor; with Nolan absent, she had free rein to make her move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, Lainey accepted a glass of champagne from a passing server and crossed the floor in elegant strides. &#34;Eleanor, what a pleasant surprise. I didn&#39;t expect to see you at the gallery tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor glanced over at the sound of her voice, her expression tightening with recognition. &#34;Hmm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Paying no mind to Eleanor&#39;s cool indifference,Lainey deliberately placed herself right in front of her. &#34;With your reputation in design, I&#39;m sure your art knowledge is just as impressive. Since you seem so taken with this painting, why not tell us what makes it special?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words immediately piqued the curiosity of nearby guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most people there knew Enigma&#39;s real story. She was an orphan with a background in clinical studies and finance,with no formal connection to the art world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s challenge was thinly veiled, a provocation in plain sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, nobody stepped forward to defend Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew how much the Benton family doted on Lainey; she even walked with bodyguards clearing the way. Crossing her was simply out of the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, there were plenty in the crowd who held grudges against Enigma, some still bitter they couldn&#39;t get their hands on her designs, all hoping to see her trip up tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them chimed in, &#34;That&#39;s right. Enigma, you&#39;re not going to claim you know nothing, are you? That would be pretty humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor let her eyes drift over the group, her tone detached as if watching a circus. &#34;Does Nolan know you&#39;re bullying me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room fell instantly silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had been eager to see drama quickly lost their nerve, their faces turning pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s very name carried enough weight to make anyone think twice; even the most brazen guests knew better than to cross him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was sheer foolishness to pick a fight with Eleanor,especially knowing she was the one Nolan cared for. Lainey&#39;s anger flared. How dared this bitch hide behind Nolan&#39;s name yet again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grip tightened on her dress as she shot Eleanor a look. &#34;Nolan&#39;s own grandfather hasn&#39;t even accepted you, but you think it&#39;s okay to act all high and mighty just because of him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor just let out a dry laugh, her eyes cold and dismissive as she looked at Lainey. &#34;Nolan? Oh,please. Did he ever say you could call him that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hardly had Eleanor finished speaking when a calm,deep male voice echoed from the entrance. &#34;She&#39;s right, I never did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The once-busy hall fell eerily quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All heads turned toward the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stood there, hands tucked casually in his pockets, radiating effortless confidence. His presence commanded attention, as if he owned the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her anger, Lainey felt her heart flutter. He was breathtaking. She would do anything to stand by his side, no matter the cost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly smoothed her hair, arranging her expression into what she hoped was a winning smile,and prepared to step toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the hopeful look vanished almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan strode straight past everyone, not sparing Lainey a single glance. All eyes followed him as he made his way,directly to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, he slipped off his jacket and gently settled it over Eleanor&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gesture caught Eleanor off guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her head to meet his gaze. &#34;What held you up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s expression softened, and a small smile tugged at the corners of his lips. &#34;Sorry. Something came up on the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with quiet confidence, he wrapped an arm around her waist and drew her close.</p>
