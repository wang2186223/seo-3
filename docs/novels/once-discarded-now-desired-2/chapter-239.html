                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes darkened as he sat beside Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared straight into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What really happened?&#34; he asked, his voice rough. &#34;And what about those remains they found in the fire?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lowered her gaze and told him everything clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey tricked me. She called me, saying my parents were trapped in the house. When I got there, thefire was already raging. I found my parents and was about to get them out when three men appeared.Lainey must have sent them. I managed to stop them and got them out through the back before the house collapsed. Then we made it back to my apartment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes narrowed as he understood immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remains at the fire weren&#39;t the Bentons and Lainey-they were the three men Lainey sent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t just tried to burn Jeff and Hilda alive. She wanted to kill Eleanor too. Ruthless. Heartless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous intensity flared in Nolan&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t let Lainey get away with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt the vengeance radiating off him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently pressed her forehead to his, and spoke softly. &#34;I hate her too, but you don&#39;t need to deal with her personally. Even if she left no trace in the Benton family&#39;s estate, the hospital incident, killing those two people, can&#39;t be ignored. She&#39;ll face justice this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused and added softly, &#34;It&#39;s not worth dirtying your hands for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan felt his anger ease a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed the corner of her mouth and murmured, &#34;Alright.&#34; Their quiet moment was broken by Hilda&#39;s footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pulled back and sat properly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more knocks, Hilda rushed over, panic all over her face.&#34;Eleanor!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda hurried to her, holding her hands and looking her over from head to toe.&#34;Are you okay? Did Lainey hurt you? Are you dizzy or in pain anywhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff came right behind Hilda, looking conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew this mess was his fault. He hadn&#39;t recognized his own daughter, and allowed Lainey to manipulate everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The weight of guilt pressed down on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had even caused Eleanor pain because of Lainey&#39;s schemes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was so overwhelmed she couldn&#39;t find the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tried to pull her hand back instinctively, but Hilda&#39;s grip tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Mrs. Benton,&#34; Eleanor replied quietly, her tone distant, almost detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda froze, worry fading slowly as she looked at Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her lips trembled. &#34;Sweetie, you won&#39;t even call me Mom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt Hilda to hear it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Jeff had failed Eleanor for so many years, leaving her alone to struggle and suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So asking her to forgive and accept them immediately was too much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streamed down Hilda&#39;s face as guilt and sorrow took over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff moved closer, hands shaking as he steadied Hilda, who wobbled under the weight of her emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t even acknowledge Hilda,let alone him. His voice shook as he spoke, &#34;Eleanor, I was the one who failed you. I trusted Lainey and caused you so much pain. You have every right not to accept us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked into her clear eyes, and his heart ached with regret. &#34;I promise, I will make things right. I&#39;ve even arranged for an official statement to be released, telling everyone that you&#39;re our real daughter.&#34;</p>
