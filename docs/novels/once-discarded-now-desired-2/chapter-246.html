                <p>Lainey&#39;s stare finally locked onto Kurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her once-lifeless eyes ignited with fury the moment she realized who stood before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leapt from her seat, stormed toward the thick glass barrier, and snatched the receiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You incompetent fool! What kind of worthless lawyer did you send? Didn&#39;t you swear everything would work out? This was deliberate! You intended to make me suffer! Kurt, it&#39;s entirely your fault!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every shred of warmth inside Kurt&#39;s chest froze instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock rendered him immobile, as if witnessing the little girl he had cherished for decades transform before his very eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this truly the sweet, charming Lainey he had known?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or had this ferocity always existed, hidden beneath her innocence, unseen until now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence only convinced Lainey she had struck a nerve, fueling her rage further. &#34;It&#39;s al because of you! lf you hadn&#39;t insisted on clinging to Denny so stubbornly, how could I have ended up trapped like this? I&#39;m doomed to decay here forever! Every single day of my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her screams tore through the room, tears and mucus streaking her face in chaotic abandon. &#34;I&#39;d be better dead! I despise you! I despise you! Why couldn&#39;t you just die!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt&#39;s lips quivered, yet not a word emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The daughter he had nurtured, spoiled, and loved above all else for more than twenty years now wished him gone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bone-deep chill spread fromn his feet to his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accused him. Had she truly believed he chose to abandon her? The child he had raised had left him for another family,and nobody could fathom the pain that caused him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even aware she belonged to the Benton family, he had swallowed his anguish to support her, providing funds generously so she could live comfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And she? Every visit was met with cold rejection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained ignorant of her past deeds overseas and her actions within the Benton household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, she blamed him entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kurt&#39;s heart hardened, solid and unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All traces of paternal devotion vanished completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast one final, lingering glance toward her before pivoting and striding away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s screams halted, replaced by frantic pleading.&#34;Dad, don&#39;t go! Please don&#39;t leave me. If you walk away, what will become of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only his firm back answered, unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another voice, however, emerged from the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk, my dear ex-wife, how did you manage a life sentence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He approached the visiting window, his glare sharp. He grabbed the receiver and hissed through clenched teeth, &#34;You made me lose Eleanor, and this is exactly what you deserve.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s anger flared like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared a bankrupt loser, incapable of rescuing his own empire, lecture her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spitting toward him, her eyes blazed with disdain.&#34;Do you forget how you grovelled like a pitifui dog,begging me for cash? And now you dare lecture me?&#34; Recounting past humiliations drove Jonny into a furious frenzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been humiliated by a fraud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame clawed at him relentlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The receiver trembled in his grip, as if he could crush her through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You wretch! You&#39;ll pay for this! But it won&#39;t matter. Prison will consume you for the rest of your days! And I will ensure no peace reaches you inside those walls. You&#39;ll drown in torment!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a violent slam, he ended the call and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey erupted into madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurled herself against the glass, pounding, screaming relentlessly. &#34;Jonny! Jonny! Return immediately!|swear, if I perish, I will haunt you endlessly and make every moment a nightmare! Jonny! Come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She screaméd until visiting hours ended, but silence remained the only reply.</p>
