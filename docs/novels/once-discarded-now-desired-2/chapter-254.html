                <p>After Nolan and Eleanor finished the cake, night had completely fallen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked through the hotel lobby,they suddenly ran into Wray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped out of the elevator with a crowd around him,brimming with confidence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his new position in hand, he was eager to host banquets and win over hearts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he spotted Nolan, his steps faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A senior executive, eager to curry favor, rushed to speak. &#34;Mr. Stewart, you&#39;re so ambitious and full of promise. Under your leadership, the Stewart Group will surely reach new heights! Not like someone here,who&#39;s so blinded by a woman that he&#39;s lost all reason!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he shot Nolan a mocking glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Others quickly chimed in,echoing his words, &#34;Exactly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray basked in the praise, his smile wide and smug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, however, acted as if he heard nothing. He kept walking without sparing a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking this as a sign of weakness, the executive grew bolder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mustn&#39;t follow Nolan&#39;s example-falling for a divorced woman! He&#39;s nearly dragged the Stewart Group into disgrace!&#34; His voice rang loud in the lobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face darkened at the mention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Nolan finally stopped. He turned his head slowly, his cold eyes fixing on the man. His voice was flat and sharp. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just three words, yet they struck like a bucket ofice water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The executive froze, his smugness vanishing. The air itself seemed to grow heavy, and no one dared to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lately, Nolan&#39;s gentle side with Eleanor had made them forget who he truly was-the man who had once seized control of the Stewart Group with an iron hand.That ruthless edge had never lefthim. The executive&#39;s legs buckled. His lipstrembled,but no sound came out. Wray cursed him silently. What a fool!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a smile, Wray quickly stepped in. &#34;Nolan,don&#39;t mind their nonsense. You just focus on Eleanor.The company&#39;s in good hands with me. No need to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan and Eleanor brushed past him without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wray&#39;s smile stiffened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he and Brodie took full control, he would grind Nolan beneath his heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and Nolan, unfazed, returned to the villa in Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan looked at her, his Adam&#39;s apple shifting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he spoke softly, almost hesitant.&#34;Eleanor, can we share a roomn tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afraid she would refuse, he quickly added, &#34;I swear, I won&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was slipping off her coat when his cautious gaze met hers. Her heart softened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she couldn&#39;t bend her principles. &#34;No,&#34; she replied firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light in Nolan&#39;s eyes dimmed at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his disappointment, Eleanor felt a pang of sympathy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment, she offered a small concession. &#34;But you can move into the room next to mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Nolan,even that was a blessing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He immediately turned to go upstairs and pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,he could move closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just then, Fannie popped out from behind the sofa,with a pitiful look at Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor! Nolan bullied me! We prepared a surprise for him, and as soon as it ended, he had Erick drag me away! I worked the whole day and didn&#39;t even get a bite of cake!&#34; she cried, full of accusation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face twisted with exasperation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned toward Nolan, who had just reached the stairs. He hadn&#39;t taken a single step up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should stay in your original room,&#34; she said coldly.  Nolan froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his teeth, his glare cutting straight at Fannie-the culprit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Fannie only stuck her tongue out playfully,unfazed by his murderous stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s hopes of moving closer to Eleanor were dashed, his frustration plain to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet he could neither scold his sister nor the woman he loved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end,he called Erick, dragging him out of sleep,and rattled off a string of work instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still half-dreaming,Erick grew even more confused as he listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of boss handed out tasks in the middle of the night?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt utterly wronged.</p>
