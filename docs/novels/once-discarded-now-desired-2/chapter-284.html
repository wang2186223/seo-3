                <p>That night, the Benton family&#39;s estate glowed wvith cheerful lights and welcoming warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the kitchen, energy and laughter filled the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda and Jeff, both dressed in aprons, moved around each other with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took charge at the stove, while he expertly managed all the prep work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the dining table overflowed with colorful,tempting dishes, a feast fit to make up for all those years apart in a single night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle, almost magical coziness settled over the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda kept sneaking more food onto Eleanor&#39;s plate,her every glance filled with motherly affection. Jeff might have been quieter, but the caring look he gave Eleanor said more than words ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When dinner ended, Hilda and Jeff firmly insisted that Eleanor and Nolan should stay for the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a bit of gentle protest, Eleanor and Nolan finally agreed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan got comfortable in the guest room, while Hilda softly clasped Eleanor&#39;s hand and guided her up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed open the door to a bedroom that made Eleanor stop in her tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like something out of a fairy tale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walls glowed a gentle pink, a plush carpet cushioned every step, and a glass case displayed a collection of stuffed animals and dolls that seemed lovingly preserved through the years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda watched Eleanor&#39;s reaction, her own eyes brimming with unshed tears. She picked up a Barbie dressed in shimmering clothes, her voice rich with nostalgia. &#34;You were absolutely crazy about these dolls when you were little,Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda added, &#34;I wasn&#39;t sure what you&#39;d enjoy after all this time, but I thought every child loves these, so I just kept adding new ones.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She carefully set the doll in Eleanor&#39;s hands, her eyes flickering with a blend of hope and unease. &#34;This will always be your home, sweetheart. You&#39;re welcome here anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stared at the doll, overwhelmed by a rush of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step closer and wrapped Hilda in a gentle hug,the kind of embrace reserved for someone who had waited a lifetime.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resting her head on Hilda&#39;s shoulder, Eleanor spoke in a whisper. &#34;You must have been so tired, searching for me all those years.&#34; For a moment, Hilda stiffened, then clung tightly to Eleanor, softly patting her back. &#34;Not tired at all.Finding you was worth everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda wiped at her tears as she stepped away. &#34;It&#39;s late, darling. Get some rest. I should call your three brothers; they&#39;ll be thrilled to hear about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda paused at the doorway, giving one last loving look before quietly closing the door behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sank onto the plush bed, her heart full.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was wrapped in the gentle scent of freshly laundered sheets and a lingering trace of her mother&#39;s love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, she drifted into the deepest, most restful sleep she had had in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor ended up staying with the Benton family for several days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Nolan&#39;s schedule was packed, he made time to drop by each day, secretly happy to watch Eleanor reconnect with her parents. Still, he sometimes felt like an outsider, longing for the cozy little world that belonged to just him and Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One evening, Nolan unfolded a sleek travel brochure.&#34;There&#39;s a brand-new coastal resort, gorgeous views, hot springs, just absolutely stunning,&#34; he said,pitching his idea to Eleanor and her parents with practiced charm. &#34;I&#39;d really like to take Eleanor for a relaxing getaway. We&#39;ll be back in two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the perfect excuse, impossible to refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda and Jeff exchanged a look, instantly understanding the couple needed time alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t want their daughter to feel rushed or pressured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go on, enjoy yourselves,&#34; Hilda said, flashing Eleanor a playful grin. &#34;You both deserve a break together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor and Nolan&#39;s car rolled down the drive and out onto the road, neither of them noticed the black  sedan that quietly slipped into traffic behind them,keeping a careful distance.</p>
