                <p>Jonny&#39;s mind was set as he marched off in search of Sallie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he finished speaking, Sallie&#39;s fury erupted. Her entire body shook as she pointed at him,scolding loudly, &#34;Now you want Eleanor back? Tell me, what about those three years you spent treating her like nothing more than a servat and someone to blame? You only see her value now that Lainey wants nothing to do with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Locking eye with him, she continued, &#34;Jonny, listen closely. You lost your chance. Eleanor deserved better,and you let her slip away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t come for a lecture. He wanted help, not accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Annoyance surged inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could it be his fault?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What crime had he committed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was the one who tricked him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt so unfair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just wanted to go back to how things were before; surely, there was nothing wrong with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t believe he was at fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a glare that could cut through steel, he spat back, his words cold and biting, &#34;I&#39;m your own grandson. If you won&#39;t take my side, then go ahead and stand with everyone else!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny spun around and stormed off, not sparing another look at Sallie, who sat there nearly shaking with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maids rushed to Sallie&#39;s side, helping her with calming medicine and a glass of water, working for a while before she finally calmed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of the other Todds bothered to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner, Emma watched the scene unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could that possibly be true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Lainey really the type to walk away from Jonny?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More likely, Jonny had gone too far and pushed Lainey past her limit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explanation made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she tried to brace herself, Emma&#39;s nerves refused to settle. In the end, she grabbed her bag and hurried out the door, determined to find Lainey and figure out what was really happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Emma made it to the Benton family&#39;s home, the guard blocked her way. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Todd. Mr.Benton&#39;s orders are clear. No visitors from the Todd family are allowed inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left Emma standing there, completely taken aback. &#34;How can that be? Lainey is my sister-in-law.She cares about me. If you just tell her I&#39;m here, she&#39;ll come out for sure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t have a single doubt in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the guard repeated his message without a trace of emotion, &#34;Apologies, Miss Todd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger and frustration flooded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This useless guard!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she met up with Lainey, she would see to it that he lost his job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey always looked out for her; there was no way she would refuse to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Jonny, why did he always have to upset Lainey?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of him, her own parents were furious, and now she was stuck right in the middle. Right then, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up to the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey stepped out, dressed in head-to-toe designer clothes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma couldn&#39;t help but marvel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey looked so elegant and so wealthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed over, waving excitedly. &#34;Lainey!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of her, Lainey gave a discreet roll of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anything connected to the Todd family left her feeling nothing but shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Lainey understood Emma&#39;s nature far too well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Acting rashly would only invite more headaches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made more sense to stir things up and distract her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this approach, she could keep Emma busy and at the same time unsettle Eleanor, a win on both fronts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting on a sorrowful expression, Lainey softened her eyes and let her voice tremble slightly. &#34;Emma, I don&#39;t think I can be your sister-in-law anymore. Jonny... he still can&#39;t let go of Eleanor. He told me he never cared about me, that I was just convenient for him. He even grabbed me by the neck right in front of my parents, all because of Eleanor. That&#39;s why my parents are so upset.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she finished, Lainey pulled her collar aside to reveal a mark on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance was all it took for Emma to buy the whole story. She had suspected all along that Eleanor was to blame for this mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, don&#39;t cry! Jonny&#39;s just not thinking straight right now. I promise, I won&#39;t let Eleanor off!&#34;</p>
