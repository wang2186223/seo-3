                <p>The moment Eleanor walked out of the Todd Group headquarters, her phone buzzed with a message from her closest friend, Lillian Brooks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s my birthday today. I know you probably can&#39;t come,but I just wanted to remind you. Honestly, I don&#39;t know what kind of spell that jerk Jonny has on you. You&#39;ve cut yourself off from everyone for his sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With little thought, Eleanor sent back a reply. &#34;Give me the address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a beat there was silence, and then her screen lit up with a text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell? What&#39;s happening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s fingers moved with calm precision. &#34;I&#39;ve signed the divorce agreement.&#34; &#34;Oh my God, you finally broke free of that lovesick title. Stay put. I&#39;m coming to you right away!&#34; A sleek maroon convertible sped on the highway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind the wheel, Lillian tipped her sunglasses down and gave Eleanor a playful whistle. &#34;Eleanor, since you&#39;re finally out of that nightmare, we&#39;re celebrating at Velvet Club tonight. We&#39;re going to have fun.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor leaned lazily against the seat, her voice quiet.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s curiosity got the better of her. &#34;So what pushed you to finally cut ties? Let me guess-Lainey&#39;s back, isn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Eleanor&#39;s lips.&#34;Congratulations. You guessed it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian slid her sunglasses off and remarked with a smirk, &#34;Back then, Lainey ran off the moment he ended up in a wheelchair, and now that she&#39;s returned, he&#39;s chasing after her like some lovesick fool. Do you think Jonny damaged more than his legs in that car crash?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hard to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you, wasting three whole years tied to that useless man,&#34; Lillian continued. &#34;Good thing there weren&#39;t any kids, or the divorce would&#39;ve been a nightmare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet laugh escaped Eleanor. &#34;There was never a chance of that. He and I never even shared a bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; Lillian almost lost hold of the steering wheel. &#34;You&#39;re telling me you were married for three years and never slept together?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s beauty was undeniable. If that was true,then was Jonny incapable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was keeping himself pure for Lainey.&#34; Just mentioning the two of them made Eleanor&#39;s stomach twist.&#34;Enough about him. Can you drop me off so l can change first?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!&#34; &lt;</p>
