                <p>No one had imagined that Sallie&#39;s birthday celebration would turn into Lainey&#39;s carefully orchestrated showcase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Eleanor and Lillian entered the hall, Emma&#39;s excited voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister-in-law is absolutely amazing! You won&#39;t believe this-she just placed first in the preliminary round of the Enigma Group&#39;s fashion design competition! I&#39;ve already secured a stack of tickets for the finals. You should come and see Lainey crowned as Enigma&#39;s apprentice!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma&#39;s apprentice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very idea carried weight and prestige beyond measure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the wealthy young women confirmed the rumor was genuine, they crowded around eagerly, their past grievances with Lainey swept conveniently aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny stood proudly at Lainey&#39;s side, basking in the light she cast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shadows of recent days melted away like mist under the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey might have caused scandals, but in this moment, she handed him honor that outshone them all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she truly secured Enigma&#39;s apprenticeship, the Todd Group would ascend into an entirely new league of influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian leaned closer, her lips twisting in doubt as she whispered to Eleanor, &#34;Hard to believe a schemer like Lainey could actually have talent in design.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor lifted her glass, letting the champagne swirl lazily. &#34;Maybe so. She did study fashion design abroad,after all.&#34; Lillian pressed her lips together and chose silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The competition&#39;s reputation spoke for itself-judges were impartial, the process transparent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey advancing to the finals meant she had genuine skill, at least on paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Lillian doubted the outcome would change anything. Winning a trophy was one thing. Being selected as Eleanor&#39;s personal apprentice was another matter entirely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With no desire to linger near the spectacle, Lillian and Eleanor turned their attention to Sallie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To their surprise, Sallie&#39;s complexion looked healthier, her energy noticeably brighter-perhaps because Lainey, consumed with her own ambitions, hadn&#39;t troubled her lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor offered her a few words of caution and care, then linked arms with Lillian, ready to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving the party, she stopped briefly at the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she stepped back into the halway, her path was suddenly blocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lifted, only to meet Jonny&#39;s self-satisfied grin, and irritation pricked at her instantly. &#34;Please step aside,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny had clearly been waiting for this chance, and now that she stood alone, he had no intention of letting her go so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny tossed his head back with exaggerated confidence, his voice dripping with self-importance. &#34;Did you catch Emma&#39;s words? It won&#39;t be long before the Todd Group rises higher than ever, and I&#39;ll be the shining figure in the city&#39;s upper circles. Didn&#39;t Besty Juarez show interest in you? If you use that connection to open doors for me, I&#39;ll make sure you live in comfort beyond your imagination.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his narrow view, Eleanor was nothing more than a woman chasing wealth through Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He believed his own hype-that he was destined to embody influence and that her affection for him meant she would never refuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smug curl of his lips deepened. &#34;But don&#39;t get ahead of yourself. The title of my wife belongs to Lainey and Lainey alone. She&#39;ll be Enigma&#39;s chosen apprentice, and I&#39;ll stand by her no matter what. You&#39;ll just have to accept that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had the man lost his senses in a matter of days?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor could only stare at him in stunned disbelief. She finally said in sharp tones, &#34;Move aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning on her heel, she started to walk past him without another glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His pride stung, Jonny&#39;s expression twisted. A wave of possessiveness surged through him as he seized her wrist and yanked her closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t put on this act, Eleanor! I can see right through you. You still care about me-you&#39;re just being distant to keep me chasing, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment his words left his mouth, Jonny lunged forward, trying to force a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s restraint shattered, every ounce of her patience gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp glint of ice flickered in her eyes as she braced herself, ready to drive her knee into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could make her move, another figure intervened first.</p>
