                <p>In the days that followed the incident, Eleanor kept herself out of sight. Not once did she dare step near Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fear of Nolan lingered. If he turned up again and pressed her with more questions, sooner or later she would give herself away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But while Eleanor hid, Lillian grew restless. One afternoon, she marched straight to the Podium Apartments and all but dragged Eleanor outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Eleanor let herself be pulled along,agreeing to a shopping trip she hadn&#39;t wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their timing, however, couldn&#39;t have been worse. By sheer misfortune, they crossed paths with Lainey and Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian muttered a curse at their rotten luck and was about to steer Eleanor away when a sharp voice rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonny, you don&#39;t even bother looking properly before saying I&#39;m stunning!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about that voice made Lillian pause mid-step. Her eyes flicked to Eleanor&#39;s, and in the same instant, they both stopped moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the bridal boutique, Jonny stood before an irritated Lainey, rubbing his temple like the weight of her words had triggered an instant headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet what choice did he have? Placating her was the only way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For me, Lainey,&#34; he replied weakly, offering the most hollow reassurance he could muster, &#34;you&#39;ll always be the most beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were flat, so empty they barely passed as sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration twisted Lainey&#39;s face as her fingers clenched the hem of the gown. Since the day their wedding date was announced,Jonny had worn the look of a man being marched to execution.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as if that weren&#39;t enough, Sallie had the audacity to survive her ordeal-and then starve herself in some pathetic attempt to derail their marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Vickie had stepped in on her behalf,cutting Sallie off before she could succeed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it mattered in the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every setback only pushed Lainey closer to her goal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sooner or later, she would become Jonny&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought a smile back to her lips. She slipped her arm through Jonny&#39;s and spoke in a coaxing tone. &#34;Jonny, you really are too sweet. But these dresses don&#39;t please me. Let&#39;s try another boutique.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s reply was little more than a grunt, neither yes nor no. Pretending not to notice his indifference, Lainey turned briskly toward the fitting room to change.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From where they stood, Lillian let out a low whistle.&#34;Would you look at that? Lainey really does have the patience of a saint.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor smirked and lifted her thumb in mock praise.&#34;Oh, she&#39;s got plenty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So much for true love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after their wedding date was set, Jonny&#39;s mask started to slip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men always longed for what wasn&#39;t theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lainey stepped out of the bridal shop with Jonny at her side, the first thing she caught were the mocking looks plastered across Lillian&#39;s and Eleanor&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A prick of heat crawled up her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they seen everything inside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She swallowed the embarrassment down, refusing to let it surface. Straightening her spine, she plastered on a triumphant air, chin tilted high. &#34;Miss Warren, if you&#39;re that desperate to cross paths with Jonny, you don&#39;t need to drag poor Ms. Brooks along as cover.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had always known how to weaponize her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one cutting remark, she managed to jab at Eleanor while sowing seeds of discord toward Lillian.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the trap fell flat-Lillian didn&#39;t flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she circled the couple slowly, her lips curling into a smile that dripped with venom. &#34;A tramp and a fool-you deserve each other. May you both choke on your happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You-&#34; Lainey&#39;s anger nearly boiled over, but she choked back the words before they escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was Lillian, spoiled by the Brooks family. She wasn&#39;t someone she could afford to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>StilI, resentment festered. How could Eleanor-ordinary, with no power or pedigree-earn the  protection of both the Stewarts and the Brooks family? It was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey was ready to spit more poison, when Jonny suddenly tugged her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lainey, drop it. We&#39;re leaving,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about sitting across from Eleanor unsettled Jonny. The sight of his ex-wife-calm,unruffled, radiant in her own quiet way-left a strange flicker of shame gnawing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He should have been boasting, showing her how far above her he now stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the memory of that hundred-million wedding gift from Lainey&#39;s father weighed heavy on him, making his pride feel cheap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One day, he promised himself, once his company survived this crisis, he would pay it back in full-then rub his success in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his word given, Lainey had no room left to press the matter. Still, in her heart, one truth remained unshakable:when the wedding came, she had to be the star.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gown she wore needed to scream perfection.Nothing less would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, Lainey cast Eleanor one last poisonous glare, then spun on her heel and stormed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the way, Eleanor lifted her thumb toward Lillian with a small, knowing grin. Nicely done.</p>
