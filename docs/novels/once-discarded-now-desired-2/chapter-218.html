                <p>Horace pressed a trembling hand to his bleeding arm,stumbling through the chaos toward the back door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had always prided himself on his wits, but tonight,he had been thoroughly bested-outsmarted by a woman when it mattered most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gritted his teeth, swearing to himself that if he made it out alive, he would make her pay for this humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His wound throbbed with fiery pain, and the blood loss sent dark spots dancing before his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a familiar silhouette materialized from the shadows near the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was McCollum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A surge of relief washed over Horace-finally,someone who could help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCollum had stayed out of the rowdy hall and was surely sober.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation sharpening his voice, Horace called out,  &#34;McCollum! Over here-help me out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dangled a promise in the air. &#34;Get me out of this,and I&#39;ll make you second-in-command of the Fist Guild!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with his life hanging by a thread, Horace couldn&#39;t resist making promises he would never keep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite knowing Eleanor belonged to Nolan, he had tried to take her for himself-either foolish or suicidal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCollum&#39;s face gave nothing away as he strode toward Horace, looking every bit the loyal rescuer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as Horace finally let out a shaky breath, a massive fist came out of nowhere, crashing into his jaw with bone-jarring force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace didn&#39;t even manage a sound before his knees buckled and the world went dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Kaiden appeared with a squad,entering from the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took in the scene at a glance-Horace sprawled motionless on the ground, McCollum looming nearby,cold and impassive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaiden gave McCollum an approving nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out of here,&#34; Kaiden instructed. Two men stepped forward without hesitation, grabbing Horace and hauling him away like he was nothing more than a sack of rubbish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Horace finally came to, his head throbbed as if it had been split open, his jaw aching with every breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly realized he was bound tight to a chair,ropes biting into his wrists. He was in his own bedroom -at least, it looked like it-but everything felt different now, wrong and unfamiliar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, he recognized Darlene&#39;s silhouette.She was standing with her back to him, deep in conversation with Kaiden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaiden, from this moment on, the entire Fist Guild is mine,&#34; Darlene declared, her voice ringing with newfound authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace sat in stunned disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never imagined that his wife knew Kaiden personally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene continued,her words dripping with contempt,&#34;As for Horace, I&#39;ll see to it that he stays in line from now on. You have my word. He won&#39;t be a problem again. And if you speak with Mr. Stewart, I&#39;d appreciate you passing along our apologies for what happened with Miss Warren. The Fist Guild will answer to the  Stewart Group from this day forward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaiden nodded, clearly pleased, and gave her shoulder an approving pat. &#34;Darlene, you&#39;re far shrewder than Horace&#39;ll ever be. It&#39;s good to see you know where your loyalties belong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before stepping out, he cast a glance at Horace-nothing but disdain in his eyes. &#34;Everything in Zerovia revolves around the Stewart family. We&#39;d do well to remember who built this country&#39;s reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Kaiden exited, hands clasped behind his back, and shut the door with a quiet finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the room was suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene finally turned, her eyes blazing with a cold,predatory light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke out across Horace&#39;s skin, dread creeping up his spine. He shuddered and dropped his gaze, voice quivering as he pleaded, &#34;Baby, please,I messed up-I&#39;m begging you, I&#39;m so sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darlene&#39;s only answer was a sharp slap across his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t spare him another glance. Instead, she waved to the loyal guards stationed just outside the door. &#34;Take him away,&#34; she instructed coolly. &#34;No one is to let Horace out-not for any reason, not even for a breath of fresh air-unless I say so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood, ma&#39;am!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s former followers wasted no time. They closed in, seizing him without a hint of hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, the reality hit him like a hammer-his grand plans, his schemes, all of it was finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything he had built was lost in a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mind reeled, drifting back to a warning Darlene had given him years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She told him his downfall would come at the hands of a woman, but he laughed it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All those years, he had played around, convinced he was untouchable, always letting the women pay the price.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this time, her prediction had come true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Regret settled in his bones, heavy and suffocating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now,regret was useless. It was all over.</p>
