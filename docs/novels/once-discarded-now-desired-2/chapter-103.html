                <p>For the next two days, Eleanor and Lillian lived without restraint, chasing every thrill they could find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They raced across the waves on jet skis, watched fireworks paint the night sky over the ocean, and ended their nights with smoky barbecues by the shore.It was the kind of carefree fun they had always dreamed about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But their joyride was cut short. On their way back from the beach, their car hadn&#39;t even pulled up to Eleanor&#39;s apartment when a seek black Volkswagen suddenly swerved in front of them, blocking the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door flew open, and out hopped a sprightly old man.Without hesitation, he yanked Eleanor&#39;s car door wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Quick, Eleanor, come with me!&#34; he blurted,practically dragging her out. &#34;I&#39;ve got an interview,and I can&#39;t go alone. I&#39;m too nervous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian sat frozen in the passenger seat, too shocked to even react as Eleanor was swept away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, Eleanor found herself in a television station dressing room. Dyer planted her firmly into a chair and wagged his finger like a stern grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay here. Don&#39;t even think about running. You know how easily I get rattled in front of cameras. Without you nearby, I&#39;ll lose my nerve,&#34; Dyer insisted with exaggerated seriousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor bit back a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the same man who once marched alone into a freshly unearthed tomb to examine relics no one dared touch, yet now he claimed to be scared of a few cameras.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a child wouldn&#39;t buy such a flimsy excuse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor had no choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer was her mentor, and she knew when to yield.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she gave him a reluctant nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took. Dyer, pleased, straightened his jacket and headed out cheerfully towards the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, the live broadcast kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After greeting the viewers, the host leaned in with a bright smile. &#34;Mr. Curtis, the discovery of the Blackwind Catacombs is groundbreaking. We hear you&#39;ll personally be guiding the excavation?&#34; Dyer stroked his graying beard, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes. &#34;Of course. How could I miss such a momentous event?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The host&#39;s curiosity sharpened as he pressed on. &#34;And this time, which of your brilliant students will be accompanying you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Dyer&#39;s smile grew even broader, pride filling his voice. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? My most prized protégé.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned slightly and gestured to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera followed, and the nation&#39;s audience was caught off guard by the sudden reveal of a calm,striking figure stepping into frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enigma.Or rather,Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Internet detonated on the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elepdon Museum&#39;s old comment section was dredged up within minutes, while the live-stream comments,after a stunned pause, exploded like fireworks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Am I seeing this right? That&#39;s Eleanor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enigma? No way. It&#39;s really her! My idol is actually on screen,live!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up, why does her name sound familiar... oh my god, she&#39;s the same woman who casually donated the Queen&#39;s diamond tiara!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So you&#39;re telling me the legendary designer Enigma is the same Eleanor who threw a hundred million in artifacts at the museum like it was pocket change?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Too much information at once, my brain&#39;s crashing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget that. Did you hear what Dyer just said? His most prized protégé!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then came the clincher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resurfaced Elepdon Museum comment, linedup perfectly with Dyer&#39;s words, sealed the theory in everyone&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brilliant archaeology disciple. A magnanimous artifact donor. Who else could Butterfly be, if not Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s expression was priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned a glare on Dyer the second he returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Didn&#39;t you say I wouldn&#39;t have to show my face?&#34;Shoving her phone at him, she added, &#34;Look at this madness. How am I supposed to quietly donate to Elepdon Museum now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trending headlines blazed across her screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shocking! Enigma Revealed as Butterfly of the Collecting World!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dyer Curtis Publicly Declares Eleanor Warren His Most Treasured Protégé!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer glanced at the words, then burst into a squinty-eyedgrin. &#34;What&#39;s there to worry about? Let the world chatter. As long as you don&#39;t confirm it, everything stays in your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him, it was nothing but noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, he had had to watch David flaunt his star student day after day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor might have studied under David first, before meeting Dyer, but because she had never formally bowed as Dyer&#39;s apprentice, he had carried the sting of being outdone for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And today,he finally got his payback.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stared at his smug expression and instantly understood that this wasn&#39;t about her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just another round in the endless duel between Dyer and David.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two old men, with nearly two centuries of life between them, were still bickering like children.Honestly,it was exhausting.</p>
