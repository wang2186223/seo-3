                <p>Night had settled over the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A call from someone who introduced themselves as Fraser&#39;s assistant left Eleanor more curious than concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser Benton?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What on earth could he want with her now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, never one to mince words, swept into the living room and planted her hands on her hips. &#34;Honestly,the Benton family just doesn&#39;t know when to quit! After everything they pulled at the hospital, now they&#39;re asking for a meeting? Trust me, this is nothing but trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Eleanor could protest, Lillian yanked her off the couch. &#34;But we&#39;re going, no question. I want to see what tricks they&#39;re playing at this time. Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m with you, and if anyone steps out of line, they&#39;ll answer to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arm in arm, the two women headed out, and Lillian bundled Eleanor into her car, then drove away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They reached the café in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian pulled into the parking spot, took a steadying breath like a soldier bracing for battle, then marched straight through the doors with purpose in her stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she stepped inside, her eyes landed on Fraser, seated beside the window with the light catching his profile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a black suuit that fit him like it had been crafted just for him. There was a quiet elegance in the way he carried himself, a polished charm wrapped in an air of steady composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man,was dangerously handsome, exactly her weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, Lillian&#39;s irritation wavered, but she quickly remembered Eleanor&#39;s earlier humiliation and Handsome or not, this was the enemy. Fraser was here for a reason, and she wasn&#39;t about to let down her guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With determination burning in her eyes, Lillian marched straight to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the moment she drew close enough to catch the depth in Fraser&#39;s eyes, something in her eased,and her expression lost some of its sharp edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You. Tell me what business you have with Eleanor.&#34; Her voice betrayed a hint of uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser barely acknowledged Lillian, his focus shifting straight to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising from his seat, he spoke in a low, even tone. &#34;Miss Warren, my father acted out of line earlier at the hospital. He lost his temper and said things he shouldn&#39;t have. I&#39;d like to apologize for him, and I hope you won&#39;t take it to heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian blinked, momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this really happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was a Benton actually offering an apology?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had walked in braced for fireworks, not courtesy. Maybe the Benton family.wasn&#39;t all bad, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could chime in, Eleanor nudged her into a chair and took a seat herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s voice was smooth, almost offhand. &#34;It&#39;s fine. I was wondering how your mother&#39;s been lately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mentioning Hilda brought a flicker of emotion to Fraser&#39;s usually steady face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lingered on Eleanor&#39;s features; she looked so much like Hilda, it caught him off guard.&#34;She&#39;s awake, but still very weak,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile crossed Eleanor&#39;s lips, relief evident in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached into her bag and pulled out a small bottle, passing it to him. &#34;These are from a friend, a remedy for asthma. Once a day with warm water.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused to make things clear. &#34;If you&#39;re uncertain, have your doctor check them first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, Fraser seemed unsure, then nodded and accepted the bottle. &#34;Thank you, truly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her message delivered, Eleanor stood up, tugging Lillian to her feet. &#34;We should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian,however, found herself wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cast an uncertain glance at Fraser, then at Eleanor; as if torn between outrage and somnething far more distracted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she really just supposed to walk out now? She hadn&#39;t said half of what she wanted, and she certainly hadn&#39;t finished appreciating the view. and she certainly hadn&#39;t finished appreciating the view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as they were about to leave, Lillian spun around and darted back to Fraser. She offered a sheepish grin,holding up her phone. &#34;Hey, um... you&#39;re kind of hard to forget. Mind if we connect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone and brought up the QR code without missing a moment. &#34;Want to add me on Facebook?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fraser seemed ready to decline, but after catching Eleanor&#39;s eye, he relented and scanned the code.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian smiled, all her inner turmoil vanishing as she finally followed Eleanor out the door.</p>
