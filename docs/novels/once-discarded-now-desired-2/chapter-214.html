                <p>Eleanor and McCollum froze at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice outside the door was Horace&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, McCollum pulled the dagger from his waist and positioned himself in front of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes had that wild, fight-to-the-end spark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Eleanor caught his wrist before he could act.&#34;Don&#39;t even think about it. That&#39;d be like running straight into a bonfire,&#34; she warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the Fist Guild&#39;s base. God only knew how many men were stationed outside. Charging out blindly meant certain death for both of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scanned the room, quick but sharp, and her gaze landed on the wardrobe. &#34;Hide in there. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, people had seen her ask McCollum to stick around, but if Horace found him in here alone with her,it would raise questions and mess up the whole plan.One slip, and their message would never get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>McCollum&#39;s jaw was tight, every muscle screaming  resistance, but he knew she was right. &#34;Watch yourself,&#34; he muttered before squeezing into the wardrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was out of sight, Eleanor straightened,smoothed her expression, and went to open the door like nothing was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strong stench of alcohol hit her first. Horace was leaning against the frame, stinking of booze, his patience long gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second he entered, his eyes darted around suspiciously. &#34;Took you long enough. What were you doing,plotting your escape?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor shot him an unimpressed look and moved aside. &#34;If I wanted to escape, I wouldn&#39;t still be here.Use your head,&#34;she retorted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace grunted, not buying it but too drunk to think straight. His head was hazy, but his hunger wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier,his wife had shoved him out when he had tried his luck, and his ego and appetite were still burning. So now,staring at Eleanor, he decided she would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to be his woman anyway-why wait?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crooked grin twisted his lips as he staggered closer.&#34;Sweetheart,how about we have some fun tonight?&#34;he drawled. Hearing that, Eleanor immediately tried to steer him away. &#34;Horace, the ceremony-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ceremony, my ass!&#34; he snapped, cutting her off.′′We don&#39;t give a damn about that nonsense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And then he lunged toward her, consumed by desire and stripped of reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment words became useless, Eleanor&#39;s whole aura shifted and her eyes went cold. ODut of nowhere,a silver needle glinted between her fingers, and just as he leaned in, she struck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s eyes went glassy. He crumpled like a puppet with its strings cut, not even managing a sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wardrobe door creaked, and McCollum rushed out, tense as ever. &#34;Miss Warren, are you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; she said, adjusting her clothes, her voice slipping back into its usual coolness. &#34;Now get out of here. Don&#39;t come near me unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary. It&#39;s too risky.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am,&#34; he replied, then vanished without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gaze dropped to Horace sprawled out on the bed, unconscious. She frowned, thinking through her next step until something shiny caught her eye. A phone. It must have slipped from his pocket in the scuffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The screen was still lit, and right there was a new message from Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips curved slightly. Interesting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Darlene happened to see this, maybe Horace would finally have something else to worry about besides bothering her.</p>
