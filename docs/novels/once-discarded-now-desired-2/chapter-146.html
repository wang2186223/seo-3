                <p>Eleanor had barely closed the car door when Nolan slid in beside her, an eager spark in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Erick there to play chauffeur, Nolan was left to his own devices. It gave him a certain boldness that was impossible to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting his head rest on Eleanor&#39;s shoulder, he showed off his wrapped hand like a kid hoping for sympathy,putting on a performance so dramatic that no one could possibly miss it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to make sense of his theatrics, Eleanor shot him a puzzled look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was a record for changing moods, Nolan would shatter it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just a moment ago, he had that fierce, untouchable vibe. NNow, he acted like the world&#39;s most tragic figure,begging for a littleaffection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His knack for switching it up could put any award-winning actor to shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved to shove him away, but he caught her wrist with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a wounded pout, he said, &#34;You left me alone at your place. Don&#39;t you think you should make it up to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face drifted closer, his tone shifting into something soft and dangerously sweet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor slid away from him, her gaze flickingto the window as if looking for an escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to steady her nerves, she cleared her throat. &#34;You do realize you just picked a fight with Jeff Benton,right? What if he goes straight to your grandfather with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Norwood&#39;s name was mentioned, Nolan straightened up. His polished expression darkened,shadowed by something unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heartbeat passed before he met her gaze. &#34;If I&#39;m being honest, my grandpa might end up liking you even less than he already does. But I promise you this-I won&#39;t let anything get in the way of marrying you. Not even him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He delivered those words like a promise set in stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Eleanor blinked before turning away, searching for anything to look at except him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said I wanted to marry you,&#34; she blurted, voice shaky. &#34;Would you quit messing around? Just drive.I&#39;ve got a lot to handle today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan let out a laugh and rested his hands on the wheel. &#34;Whatever you say, baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After leaving the restaurant, Jeff did everything he could to bail Lainey out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two days crawled by before Lainey finally returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how pale and exhausted she was, Jeff felt something in his chest twist painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged out of his suit jacket and gently placed it over her shoulders. &#34;Come with me to Breoqua,sweetheart. Things at home are too messy for you to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suggestion hit her like a cold wind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leave now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would mean letting Nolan slip straight into Eleanor&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why should she make it that easy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks the moment the thought hit, making her look even more fragile.&#34;I can&#39;t leave, Dad. I&#39;ve cared about Nolan for so long,&#34; she whispered, grabbing hold of his sleeve. Her voice trembled, her eyes pleading with him. &#34;Can you help me? I just want a chance with Nolan.Please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sight of her crying, he forgot how much he resented Nolan and that Lainey was still married to Jonny</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seconds away from agreeing when Hilda appeared with a plate of fruit, her words slicing through his moment of weakness. &#34;Jeff, Nolan already has a girlfriend.&#34; Reality snapped back into focus for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously Eleanor and Nolan were deep in love with each other. She wouldn&#39;t let go without a fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s thoughts drifted to Hilda, his eyes softening as he studied her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept seeing Eleanor&#39;s face in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance to Hilda was almost uncanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could two people look so much alike?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange discomfort settled in Jeff&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey noticed how far away he seemed, so she gave his hand a quick squeeze. &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter to me,Dad. I still want to be with Nolan,&#34; she insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pretending to be the perfect daughter was pointless now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After everything that happened, nobody could blame her for showing a little stubbornness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping her tears, she turned to Hilda with a pleading look. &#34;Mom, that girl isn&#39;t anything serious to Nolan.She&#39;s just... just a passing distraction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She caught herself before saying more. It felt smarter to hold back, especially since she knew Eleanor was the Bentons&#39; real daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she continued, her tone shifting, &#34;Nolan&#39;s grandfather would never accept her anyway.Since there&#39;s no way for them to end up together, I&#39;m not really doing anything wrong by trying to win him over,aml?&#34;</p>
