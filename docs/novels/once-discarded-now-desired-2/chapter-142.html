                <p>Once she sent off the message, Lainey stopped by her place, picked up a candle box, and headed straight for the café.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she waited for things to play out, a new scheme formed in her mind, prompting her to fire off a text to Eleanor. &#34;That man you&#39;re convinced will always be loyal? He&#39;s meeting another woman in private.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Eleanor happened to walk in and catch her and Nolan together, even in a compromising position, that would be exactly what Lainey wanted!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor sat at her desk, double-checking the most recent quarterly fabric shipments on her computer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone lit up with a notification, and she barely glanced at the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After skimming the message, Eleanor just scoffed, dropped her phone onto the desk, and dismissed the whole thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So now Lainey was done threatening and wanted to stir up drama?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How immature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor never wrote back, Lainey started to get irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Eleanor honestly not believe her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or perhaps she just didn&#39;t give a damn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey clenched her jaw and sent another message. &#34;Nova Lounge. It&#39;s across from the Stewart Group.Think I&#39;m lying? Come see it for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor saw the address, her usual detached look wavered ever so slightly. Lainey&#39;s air of certainty made it obvious Nolan planned to show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wasn&#39;t naive; if he recognized the setup, he probably had a plan of his own, maybe even hoping to put Lainey&#39;s meddling to rest finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey had a knack for scheming, and she would never shy away from bending the rules to her advantage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of unease crept in for Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of getting tangled in her own suspicions, she figured it was smarter to see what was really happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, she genuinely wanted to know what Lainey was plotting this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Eleanor memorized the location, locked her phone, and stepped outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, on the other hand, was totally oblivious to Lainey&#39;s latest manipulations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if the truth hit him in the face, he would brush it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had faith that Eleanor would understand his motives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to the moment, Nolan fixed his gaze on Lainey and delivered his warning. &#34;I&#39;m only here to say this once. Leave Eleanor alone. If you keep pestering her, I won&#39;t hesitate to let your parents hear all about what you&#39;ve been hiding abroad, and I&#39;m not just talking about Horace Boyd.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear didn&#39;t grip Lainey at first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Nolan brought up that last bit, she couldn&#39;t help but panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where had Nolan picked up details about what happened in Zerovia?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had erased every trace!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just how much did he really know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he aware of her history with drugs or, even worse, her role in those murders with Horace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no chance he could have known about all that, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of utter disgust crossed Nolan&#39;s face as he finished what he had to say and turned to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he took a step, a sudden wave of dizziness swept over him, and a strange heat started building in his veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t eaten or drunk anything here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could possibly be causing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he was struggling to steady himself, Nolan&#39;s gaze flickered to the candle quietly burning on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization hit him like a punch. The candle. That was where he had let his guard down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Nolan staggered, Lainey&#39;s fear melted away, replaced by a surge of triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had fallen into place, just as she had hoped!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she could pull Nolan into her bed, every one of her troubles would vanish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Predatory excitement lit up her gaze. &#34;Come with me, Nolan. Let&#39;s go relax in the lounge upstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she made her move to seize his arm, he jerked away and snapped, &#34;Don&#39;t touch me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled back, but even after he pulled away, the wave of discomfort kept building inside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Nolan quickly grabbed a nearby knife and opened a wound on his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, crimson fluid immediately flowed out, gaining him the clarity he desperately needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unspeakable pain churned inside Lainey&#39;s heart as she witnessed this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would rather harm himself than have sex with her? Well then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was how he liked it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wild, frenzied look tóok over Lainey&#39;s eyes as she turned around and yelled at the servants lurking behind her, &#34;Why are you just standing there? Get over here and help me grab him!&#34;</p>
