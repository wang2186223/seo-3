                <p>The night of the banquet, Eleanor had barely stepped out of the car when her phone buzzed. Lillian&#39;s name lit up the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, I just landed in Breoqua. I can&#39;t make it tonight!&#34; Lillian said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze for a moment. So that was why she hadn&#39;t heard from Lillian in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had slipped away to visit Fraser without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re terrible,&#34; Eleanor muttered, lips pressing into a thin line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cheerful laugh crackled through the line, followed by Lillian&#39;s playful pleading. &#34;Come on. Don&#39;t be mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve already arranged for someone to keep you company. She should be arriving any minute now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And before Eleanor could scold her further, the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor sighed, helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked her phone back into her clutch, lifted the hem of her gown with grace, and stepped inside the glittering venue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant she crossed the threshold of the banquet hall, a familiar figure broke through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally!&#34; Dyer&#39;s face lit up as he hurried toward her, catching her gently by the arm. &#34;Come with me,Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could get a word in, he was already pulling her through a lively sea of sharp-dressed young men,all laughter, polished shoes, and glasses of champagne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after another, Eleanor was introduced to a line of bright-eyed, ambitious men-ten in all, each seemingly more eligible than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But her expression remained composed, her heart untouched. She smiled politely, nodding with quiet indifference.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer&#39;s expression tightened with unease. He tugged Eleanor gently aside and lowered his voice. &#34;Eleanor,what&#39;s your type? If none of these men are up to standard, I&#39;ll find better ones for you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s lips curved into a faint smile. &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself. I&#39;m not looking for romance right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The wound Nolan had left behind still lingered, a bitter reminder that had stripped her of any illusions about love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, her heart belonged to her career alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dyer looked as though he wanted to argue, but before he could, a server appeared and bowed slightly. &#34;Mr.Curtis, Mr. Gill is asking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With clear reluctance, Dyer released her arm and disappeared into the crowd to meet his friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor exhaled softly, relieved to have some breathing room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drifted toward the buffet table, hoping a quick snack might ground her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could help herself, Leon-the distinguished curator of the Elepdon Museum-approached with a glass of wine in hand. His smile was warm and respectful. &#34;Ms. Warren,&#34; he said, raising the glass,&#34;thank you for your priceless contributions to the revival of cultural relics over the years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a server passed by with a tray of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gently lowered the tray to offer her a glass of red liquor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor didn&#39;t care much for alcohol, and she was hardly in the mood to drink tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, courtesy demanded something, so she reached out to accept a glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a shadowed corner of the hall, Brodie&#39;s eyes followed her every move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor&#39;s fingers brushed the stem of the glass, a sly grin flickered across Brodie&#39;s face from the shadows. Then, just as quickly, he vanished into the milling crowd. Eleanor hesitated, debating whether she might ask the server for juice instead. But before she could,another hand swept in and claimed the glass from her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy had appeared as if from nowhere. With a polished smile directed at Leon, she said smoothly,Ortiz, Eleanor has another engagement shortly. I&#39;ll drink this on her behalf.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, Betsy tipped the glass back, downing the wine in a single motion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leon chuckled, clearly not taking offense, and after a few pleasantries, drifted away into the throng.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was gone, Eleanor turned to Betsy, puzzled. &#34;What are you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy set the empty glass neatly onto the server&#39;s tray before answering. &#34;Lillian didn&#39;t want you facing this evening alone. She sent me to keep you company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization settled over Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy was the one Lillian had promised to send in her stead.</p>
