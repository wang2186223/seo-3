                <p>Inside Todd Group&#39;s office, Jonny glared down at the empty investor list Allard had delivered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage boiled over, and in one violent sweep Jonny sent everything on his desk crashing to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That damn Enigma! From this day on, we are enemies!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fury only grew as his thoughts spiraled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those spineless investors-switching sides at the last second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All because of Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they value some faceless designer above Todd Group&#39;s legacy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very idea was absurd!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s chest rose and fell in uneven bursts, his face darkening as his fists clenched so hard the sound of his bones straining filled the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the entire world plotting against him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No-he would never accept that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He would not lose. Not like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a sudden motion, he turned to Allard, his eyes wild with resolve. &#34;Send word immediately-we&#39;re willing to give up half of the agency rights for the Usepsall project. Anyone serious about negotiating can come to the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a desperate gamble, but he convinced himself it was enough. With bait like that, someone had to bite.The Usepsall project was hailed as one of Elepdon&#39;s brightest prospects in years. Even a fragment of it could raise a modest company to the level of a public listing. With bait that tempting, investors were bound to circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...&#34; Allard hesitated, his words dragging before he forced them out. &#34;You already promised forty percent of the agency rights to Lainey...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s voice sliced through the air before he could finish. &#34;Take it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing outweighed the survival of Todd Group. Not even Lainey. He would smooth things over with her later, one way or another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard, sensing the finality in his tone, gave a quick nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s personal matters weren&#39;t his concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All he wanted was for Todd Group to endure a little longer-long enough for him to reach retirement without disaster looming over his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation looked grim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the current pace, Todd Group might not survive another six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What value did the Usepsall project hold if the company collapsed before it bore fruit?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without Eleanor, the fall of Todd Group felt inevitable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey brought nothing to the table, and Jonny himself was stumbling blindly. The sharpest directors had already cashed out their shares and walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard could only sigh-better to take things one day at a time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even with a sliver of hope, Jonny&#39;s mood stayed dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slumped into his chair, pressing his fingers to his temples as if he could knead away the pressure building in his skull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his haze, he caught the faint sight of steam rising from a bowl of soup placed neatly on the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In front of it, Eleanor&#39;s face appeared, her usually steady eyes soft wvith quiet admiration. Jonny blinked hard, straining to see her more clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the next instant, both the bowl and Eleanor&#39;s figure vanished like smoke, leaving only the empty desk.What was wrong with him? Why did Eleanor keep invading his thoughts when he least expected it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a harsh shake of his head, Jonny tried to drive her image away, as though erasing her could steady him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,Colby&#39;s words echoed like a curse he couldn&#39;t silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible Todd Group truly couldn&#39;t survive without Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sounded ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, he couldn&#39;t deny the truth. When she was by his side, no matter what storm hit the company, they had always managed to pull through at the last possible moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Eleanor&#39;s steady hand, the company stayed afloat, and his personal life ran like clockwork. Everything was in order, leaving him free of worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot tightened in his chest, strange and unwelcome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enough,he told himself-there was no use dwelling on the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only thing that mattered now was shoring up the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that was done, he could go to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had adored him for years, lowering herself time and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wouldn&#39;t simply turn cold overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only needed to reach out, tosoften his tone, to make amends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s anger now? He dismissed it as jealousy. Of course she would be upset-he was living with Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But wasn&#39;t that proof of how much she still cared? He convinced himself it would take little more than gentle coaxing to draw Eleanor back.</p>
