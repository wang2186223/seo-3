                <p>From the shadows of the room, Allard stepped forward with hesitation. &#34;Mr. Todd, you&#39;ve never paid much attention to Eleanor, so it makes sense you wouldn&#39;t know. The truth is, your grandmother arranged all of this behind the scenes. Over the years, Eleanor has given everything to this company,and we&#39;ve all seen the effort she put in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon hearing this, Jonny almost laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To him,Eeanor wasn&#39;t some tireless worker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was an opportunist chasing money and recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She built herself on lies. What real skill could she possibly offer?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company would survive just fine without her. Driven by that thought, Jonny fixed his gaze on Allard. &#34;Get me in front of the Stewart Group&#39;s investment manager. I&#39;ll handle the negotiations myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right away, Mr. Todd!&#34; Allard hurried out, but not long after, he returned with his head low and shoulders heavy. &#34;Sir, they refused to budge. No matter what I said, they wouldn&#39;t reconsider. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any chance left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fury surged through Jonny as his fists tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the Stewart Group wanted to pull out, so be it. He would secure another investor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Usepsall project was a treasure waiting to be claimed, and he refused to believe there wasn&#39;t another company eager to profit from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Allard was waved off with little concern, and Jonny strode back into his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every effort he made to salvage the situation ended the same way. He humbled himself, reached out to one firm after another, yet not a single company dared to back him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each response carried the same excuse-they couldn&#39;t afford to offend the Stewart Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defeat pressed down on him as he collapsed onto the sofa, his temples throbbing with anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, the Todd Group had run smoothly, and it always seemed to trace back to the time he married Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it really have been her doing all along?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very idea made him scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was nothing more than a plain, uninspiring wife. What did she know about running a corporation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be pure luck, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agitated, Jonny yanked at his tie, then stormed out to head home. The moment he stepped through the door,Lainey appeared in his path. &#34;Why are you here?&#34; he asked,his tone sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though he understood she had acted with good intentions, Jonny couldn&#39;t forget the humiliation he had suffered that day. The memory still stung, and his words came out sharper than he meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching her dress tightly, Lainey wondered if his coldness was because of Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men,she thought bitterly, could never be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luckily, she had already laid the groundwork. Vickie knew of her desire to move in and eventually marry Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she secured her place as his wife, the Todd fortune would naturally fall into her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she wouldn&#39;t need to bend over backwards to keep him happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put on a sorrowful expression for Vickie&#39;s benefit. &#34;Vickie, it feels like Jonny doesn&#39;t want me here.I should go and visit you another day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a move to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny hadn&#39;t told her to leave, and confusion flickered across his face. Just as he opened his mouth,Vickie cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jonny, you&#39;re exhausted from carrying the company every day. You deserve someone gentle and considerate by your side,&#34; she said warmly. &#34;Lainey should live here with you. You&#39;re still young, and it&#39;s only natural to build your feelings together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile broadened, pride in her tone.&#34;You wasted three years shackled to that thankless country woman Eleanor.Now that she&#39;s out of the picture, it&#39;s time to give Lainey the place she deserves. I&#39;ll speak to her father tomorrow and finalize your wedding date.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Gilbert family couldn&#39;t compare to the Todds in power, but Lainey had grown up under Vickie&#39;s watchful eye. Her beauty and her gentle manner pleased Vickie, who had already decided she was the  right woman for Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma, brimming with excitement, clasped Lainey&#39;s hand. &#34;This is wonderful! You&#39;re finally going to be my sister-in-law. I&#39;ve been waiting for this forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma had despised Eleanor from the beginning,and in her mind Lainey was the perfect fit for her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s gaze shifted from his mother to his sister,then landed on Lainey. Something gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she deliberately pressing for marriage?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t sound like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was supposed to be gentle, sincere, incapable of scheming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must really care for him if she wanted to stay by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he was reassured by the thought, his voice lost its edge. &#34;Lainey, forgive me. I&#39;ve been on edge with work, and I didn&#39;t mean to sound harsh. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here. Moving in is fine, but the wedding will  have to wait. The company demands too much of me right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Patience had always been Lainey&#39;s strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sliding her arm around his, she leaned against him with a soft smile. &#34;Jonny, you don&#39;t need to apologize. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s been selfish, bothering you when you&#39;re exhausted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tenderness chipped away at his defenses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew her into his arms and brushed a kiss against her hair. &#34;You&#39;re amazing, Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of the room, Vickie and Emma exchanged knowing glances before quietly slipping away to their bedrooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey settled into the Todd household,Eleanor would be nothing but a memory. The thought filled them with quiet satisfaction.</p>
