                <p>Eleanor took her time before finally giving a small nod.&#34;Alright, let me have a look,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath her calm exterior, Eleanor was determined to find out whether Elora&#39;s pain was real or just an act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped up to the guest room door and gave it a gentle knock. Inside, Elora leaned against the headboard, lost in her book. When the door opened,Elora started to get up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie hurried to her side, placing a steadying hand on her shoulder. &#34;Don&#39;t move, Elora. You&#39;re still healing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie then shared the real reason why they had come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora listened, and her expression became a mix of relief and embarrassment. &#34;Thank you, Eleanor,&#34; she murmured, calmly offering her wrist, its bruises clear to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a seat beside her, Eleanor began examining Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was obvious that Elora&#39;s body was worn down by long-term neglect and stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about her condition supported the truth of her story. There was no hint she was pretending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, Eleanor couldn&#39;t shake a subtle sense of discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was so subtle that she couldn&#39;t even put it into words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no desire to doubt Elora, especially with Nolan regarding her as family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she was simply letting her thoughts spiral.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor masked any concern with a composed smile before speaking. &#34;You&#39;re fine for now. Just remember to look after yourself from now on,&#34; she advised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie let out a quiet sigh, finally at ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a courteous nod, Eleanor excused herself and made her way to the living room. Nolan trailed after her, and she turned to face him. &#34;I got to go,&#34; she announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan instinctively reached out, not wanting her to leave so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been days since they had really connected,and he longed for her company. Still,Eleanor paid no mind to his obvious longing,holding up her phone as if to prove a point. &#34;My mom just messaged. She wants me home early,&#34; she explained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan just watched her go, unable to find the words to make her stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she left through the grand gates of the villa, she immediately called for the Benton family&#39;s driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crisp air outside offered a small sense of relief from her tangled thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her realizing it, Nolan stood quietly by the upstairs window, watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she telling the truth just now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If her mom truly wanted her home right away, she would have sent a car without delay. There was no way she would have been left waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then,what was the real reason she lied to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting little things slide had always been her way. On paper, Elora&#39;s arrival shouldn&#39;t have rattled her at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he had messed up. His recent detachment had left Eleanor feeling neglected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to figure out how to set things right between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, his phone buzzed, and Erick&#39;s name flashed across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, I owe you an apology. You trusted me to send Colson and his family away in three days, but l couldn&#39;t get it done. I&#39;ve discovered they&#39;re plotting something behind your back. It&#39;s already in motion,and this time, the target seems to be your fiancée.The details are still blurry, but I&#39;ll dig deeper until I have answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trouble brewing for Eleanor?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Nolan&#39;s face, his mood turning icy.&#34;Make sure someone is keeping watch over Eleanor at all times. Her safety comes first. And double our efforts to expose whatever they&#39;re planning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Erick responded. &#34;Will do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had no idea that his decision was misguided,missing the true danger lurking beneath the surface.That single mistake almost cost him the woman he cherished most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was a story for another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Nolan began climbing the stairs, a gentle voice called out, pulling him from his thoughts. &#34;Nolan?&#34; Elora&#39;s words trembled with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered near the steps, her eyes anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s better if I find somewhere else to stay,&#34;she suggested. &#34;I get the feeling Eleanor&#39;s upset.Women usually trust their instincts, and I don&#39;t want to cause any tension between you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Elora&#39;s willingness to step back, even when she was still recovering, softened something in Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor isn&#39;t mad at you. She&#39;s only frustrated because I haven&#39;t been around much lately. You don&#39;t need to worry about it. I used to be with her almost all the time,&#34; Nolan explained, a hint of fondness brightening his tone as he remembered the old days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did it truly dawn on Nolan that Eleanor was hurt because he had grown distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had always been close, practically inseparable,but lately, he had let that slip. The fact that she hadn&#39;t confronted him or thrown accusations his way made him realize just how patient she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet chuckle slipped from Nolan at the thought. He looked back at Elora. &#34;You just focus on getting some rest. Leave the worrying to me.&#34; With that,he disappeared into his study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for the flashy little romance guidebook he hadn&#39;t finished, Nolan settled in and began reading,determined to make things right.</p>
