                <p>Ryland&#39;s expression soured. &#34;Hey, Besty, that&#39;s not entirely fair. Good men still exist, like me, for instance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped his chest with a smug grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty fought the urge to roll her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Refusing to indulge his antics, Betsy instructed her assistant to handle him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Betsy&#39;s firm demeanor, Ryland couldn&#39;t resist messing with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sank onto the sofa, legs crossed lazily.′′Amajor client like me, and this is how I&#39;m treated? Maybe |should report your office for poor customer service.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s jaw tightened, fury simmering beneath her composed surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What an insufferable fool!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a rigid smile, she gritted her teeth. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Brooks,&#34; she replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland nodded, clearly pleased, and motioned to the empty chair beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy inhaled deeply, gathered a pile of the newest design catalogs, and seated herself. &#34;These are our latest designs. Any styles your mother might enjoy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland lazily flipped through the pages, dismissing every option. &#34;This color&#39;s too loud. Mom wouldn&#39;t wear it. That design feels outdated. This fabric looks scratchy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His criticisms never ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy clutched the catalogs until her knuckles ached, resisting the urge to toss them at his smug face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could someone as wonderful as Lillian have such an unbearable brother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was incomprehensible. Yet Betsy&#39;s professionalism kept her temper in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All she could do was smile politely beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Ryland finally left, satisfied with the minimal progress, Betsy felt utterly drained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Men were exhausting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan had been difficult enough, and Ryland offered no relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, Betsy went upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was meticulously tracing patterns into fabric, fully absorbed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without lifting her gaze, she asked flatly, &#34;Did Mr. Brooks settle on a design?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s frustration surged anew at the mention. &#34;He chose one, kind of, but then found flaws in every detail.Said he&#39;d return in a few days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought, the hotter her temper flared. &#34;And get this-he actually requested that you handle him personally. Who does he think he is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor calmly set the craft knife on the table, unbothered. &#34;You manage him. I won&#39;t meet with him.From now on, all Brooks Group orders are yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy&#39;s heart sank, her expression crumpling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had just left her with a serious headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet being a subordinate, what option did Betsy truly have other than to follow orders?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just thinking about that irritating Ryland made Betsy long to find him and erase that arrogant grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing Betsy&#39;s silence, Eleanor finally glanced up. &#34;What? Something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Betsy waved her hands frantically. &#34;No, nothing wrong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she left the store, Eleanor headed to the orphanage. She joined Myah to prepare lunch for the children and then played games with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the kids took a nap, Eleanor perched on the front steps, gazing at the somber gray sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone came out, and she lingered over Nolan&#39;s contact photo before slipping it back into her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was probably with Elora right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no reason to call and set herself up for disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She needed to get used to being independent again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, she had been alone for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides,herparents were with her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt content.</p>
