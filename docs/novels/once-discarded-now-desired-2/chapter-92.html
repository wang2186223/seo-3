                <p>Lainey finally gotthe moment she had been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just two days later, headlines exploded across the internet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Breaking News! Lainey Todd, wife of the Todd Group&#39;s CEO, was revealed to be the long-lost daughter of the prestigious Benton family from Breoqua!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The announcement instantly stirred a frenzy online.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost immediately. Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed. It was Lillian calling.&#34;Eleanor,did you see it? That sly woman actually managed to climb her way up. Just goes to show, bad weeds never die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor leaned back on her sofa, calmly scrolling through a picture of Lainey on her tablet. In the photo,Lainey appeared shy and innocent, though her expression stayed unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor exchanged a few polite words with Lillian before ending the call. Not long after, another notification lit up her phone</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a message from Nolan.o you want me to look into the Benton family for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s slender fingers tapped a short reply. need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Benton family had nothing to do with her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had bigger things to worry about now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In just three days, an antique that had been lost overseas for years was going up for sale at Crownwell Auctions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a national treasure, and leaving it abroad was not an option. It had to be brought back home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Eleanor thought about this, her phone buzzed again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message from Nolan popped up</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, you&#39;ve been ignoring me for too long.When are we finally having dinner?&#34; It ended with a pitiful puppy emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare smile tugged at Eleanor&#39;s lips as she looked at the cartoon face. For once, her usually composed expression softened. She typed a single word back. &#34;Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, a sleek black Bentley rolled to a stop in front of her apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, and Nolan stepped out first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His long strides, sharply tailored suit, and perfectly defined features under the sunlight immediately caught people&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With broad shoulders and a lean waist, he looked effortlessly magnetic, drawing the eyes of everyone around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Eleanor slid into the back seat, her brows pinched slightly. &#34;Next time, don&#39;t park right at the entrance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan tilted his head,his tone playful. &#34;And why not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fastened her seatbelt and met his gaze steadily.&#34;Because I don&#39;t like being gawked at like I&#39;m on display.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chuckle was low and indulgent. &#34;Ah, so it seems being too exceptional really is a flaw.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a smooth drive, the car pulled up in front of Cloudcrest Dining-a renowned luxury restaurant in Elepdon. Exclusive and notoriously difficult to book, it was a place reserved for only the city&#39;s most influential figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter, already waiting at the entrance, bowed respectfully and ushered them inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Eleanor&#39;s surprise, the entire restaurant was empty,save for the gentle hum of soothing background music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced around, her brows slightly raised &#34;You booked out the whole place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan pulled out a chair for her with elegant precision,waiting until she was seated before replying, &#34;Of course. With who we are and the relationship we share,do you think we&#39;d get to enjoy a peaceful dinner otherwise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor said nothing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t wrong, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, sitting in such a massive restaurant with no one else around felt a little excessive to her</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,right at that moment, commotion broke out at the entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A familiar voice barked, full of irritation. &#34;What do you mean we can&#39;t go in? Do you even know who I am?&#34;It was Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot on his heels was Lainey&#39;s soft, coaxing tone.&#34;Jonny, leave it. We can eat somewhere else. It&#39;s only dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, her voice was patient and generous Inside,though,she was sneering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once,she had thought Jonny was the perfect catch But now? He seemed painfully ordinary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throwing a fit over being denied entry hardly reflected the refinement of the elite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the Bentons returned from abroad and officially claimed her, she would cast him aside without hesitation, otherwise,he would only drag down her status.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny, completely oblivious to her inner thoughts,finally swallowed his anger when the manager refused to budge Turning to her with a guilty face, he murmured, &#34;Lainey, I&#39;m sorry Let&#39;s just go somewhere else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon,their voices died down, and silence returned to the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan leisurely sliced into his steak and remarked,&#34;1can&#39;t help but wonder how such respectable parents  like the Bentons ended up with a daughter like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes lifted in curiosity. &#34;You&#39;ve met the Bentons before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At several international business conferences,&#34; he replied, his gaze steady on hers. &#34;Lainey is nothing like them,especially Mrs. Benton. She carries herself with a kind of calm elegance that, oddly enough, makes me think of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s knife paused briefly before continuing as if nothing had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t bite at his remark. Instead, she asked in a light, offhand tone, &#34;And what sort of aura do you think I have?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan set down his utensils and leaned in across the table,closing the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were intent, and his voice was low. &#34;Bold.Alluring, Fearless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick rush went through Eleanor, her heartbeat skipping unexpectedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her head, pretending to focus on her plate,though the warmth creeping up her ears betrayed her.&#34;Just eat your dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he caught the flush at her ears, Nolan&#39;s smile deepened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back into his seat, he picked up his usual calm composure. &#34;The Crownwell Auctions are coming up in a few days. Shall we go together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had planned to attend anyway, so she answered without hesitation, &#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
