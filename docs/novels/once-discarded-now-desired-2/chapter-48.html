                <p>Inside the back of the black Bentley, Eleanor shifted in her seat, unable to shake her restlessness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she was around Nolan,she found him too mysterious to read-and keeping some space seemed like the safest bet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought in mind, she cleared her throat and spoke up. &#34;Actually, can you let me out at the next corner? Something just came up, so let&#39;s catch up some other timne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She eyed the upcoming side entrance to Podium Apartments, knowing slipping in there would help her dodge Jonny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan gave no reaction at all. He kept his eyes shut, silent and unmoved by her request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick sat up front, hesitant to act without a word from  Nolan. He knew better than to guess what his boss might be thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car rolled past the intersection, Eleanor grew anxious and tried again. &#34;Mr. Stewart?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only then that Nolan gradually opened his eyes, his calm gaze fixing on her face, which still carried a trace of caution. &#34;Miss Warren, didn&#39;t you just agree to this yourself a moment ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She instantly regretted opening her mouth, wishing she could take her words back. How could she forget that the man sitting with her was never easily fooled?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was forced as she tried to sound polite.&#34;You know, Mr. Stewart, every socialite in Elepdon would do anything just to share a dinner with you. lf word gets out that I monopolized your time, I might not survive the fallout. Could you please let me off the hook this once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as she spoke, Eleanor cringed a little inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan caught the hint of embarrassment and let his  lips curl into the faintest grin. &#34;So, you&#39;re saying even someone as clever as you can get nervous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His laid-back voice made her heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she had never crossed Nolan for the sake of Todd Group three years ago, maybe none of this mess would have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Eleanor was busy kicking herself for getting tangled up with Nolan, the Bentley suddenly jolted over a bump, and she lost her balance, tumbling sideways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, Nolan reached out and caught her,steady and unflustered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stiffened, realizing just how close he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face hovered inches away-so close she could make out the sharp line of his jaw and watch the slight movement in his throat as he swallowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fresh, understated scent he always carried washed over her, making her senses spin.  Without thinking, she swallowed had, her pulse racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan looked down at the woman pressed against him, his voice dropping to a teasing tone. &#34;You know,Miss Warren, you&#39;re coming on pretty strong.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s cheeks burned as she jerked herself away scooting further across the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could things get any more embarrassing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t believe how clumsy she had just been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, even with her pride bruised, she had to admit-Nolan really was almost unfairly handsome.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No wonder all those high-society women tripped over themselves trying to catch his eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to keep things moving,Eleanor cleared her throat and tried to act like nothing happened.&#34;So, where are you taking me for dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since there was no escaping now, she figured the only thing left was to finish the meal and hope he  would let her leave afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan leaned back, arms crossed, studying her for a long moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained silent for a long while before his lips finally parted. &#34;You&#39;ll know soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the front seat, Erick caught the whole exchange and nearly laughed out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could have imagined that Nolan, one of the most influential figures in Elepdon&#39;s elite circle,would act so carefully around a girl he liked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his business partners ever found out, they would be stunned into silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick grinned. It looked like his boss was finally on the verge of getting a girlfriend!</p>
