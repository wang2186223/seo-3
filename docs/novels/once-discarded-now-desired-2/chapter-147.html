                <p>Hilda could hardly believe how shameless Lainey had become.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her face calm, though inside she felt completely drained. With a weary sigh, she said, &#34;But you&#39;re still married,Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing that snapped Jeff out of his daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He met Hilda&#39;s gaze and jumped right into a dramatic rundown of every scandal he had dug up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finishing his tirade, he added, &#34;Jonny&#39;s no match for Lainey. I&#39;ve already started leaning on the Todd Group. If he won&#39;t sign the divorce papers, he&#39;s got another thing coming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to Lainey, he gave her hand a gentle pat.&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry, baby. If you&#39;ve set your heart on Nolan, then I&#39;ll back you up all the way-  even if it costs me my reputation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The resemblance between Eleanor and Hilda didn&#39;t matter anymore. All he could see was the daughter he had finally found after years of searching, the one a DNA test had confirmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guilt he carried for the lost years would never go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever she asked for, he would make sure she had it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s spirits soared, as if she could already see herself stepping into the role of Nolan&#39;s wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had already taken Jonny fromn her once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she had Eleanor&#39;s parents, and soon, she would have the man Eleanor loved too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard Eleanor tried, she would always come up short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lost in her own world, Lainey let a flash of bitterness  show in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff stayed focused on soothing her worries, missing the shift in her mood, but Hilda caught it right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And all this animosity pointed toward Nolan&#39;s girlfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had happened between the two of them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There had to be more beneath the surface, and Hilda made a mental note to get to the bottom of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey remained completely oblivious to Hilda&#39;s curiosity, far too wrapped up in her own satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning found her up before sunrise,ready for a shopping spree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s birthday was coming fast, and Lainey,who considered herself Nolan&#39;s bride-to-be, wanted to make a statement. She needed a gift that screamed prestige, something that would leave no doubt about her place beside Nolan-and set her  apart from any rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she browsed through an antique shop, her phone buzzed unexpectedly with a new message from an unknown number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A fake contract, huh? You&#39;re not worried I&#39;ll send that video straight to the Bentons?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s grin faded in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they have uncovered that so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite winning over the Benton family, she still did not have her hands on that 20%. If her cover was blown now, she would lose everything she had now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of regret hit her. Why hadn&#39;t she just turned in the real contract from the start?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated again with a fresh message. &#34;You have twenty-four hours. Bring me the real transfer papers by tonight, or you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Threats-always more threats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did this person keep making things difficult for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why couldn&#39;t they just vanish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought triggered a dark impulse inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An audacious,dangerous plan began to take shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She typed furiously, crafting à message dripping with fake desperation. &#34;Please, I made a mistake. I swear I&#39;ll make it right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It did not take long for the response to come through. &#34;Meet me at the Nova Lounge front desk at eleven.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll be there.&#34; After Lainey slipped her phone back into her purse, a glint of steely resolve flickered in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the Nova Lounge&#39;s front desk already working for her, Lainey knew she had the upper hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even need to make an appearance to uncover her blackmailer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Let them try to steal from her-she could not wait to see who would dare step into her trap, and whether they would walk out again.</p>
