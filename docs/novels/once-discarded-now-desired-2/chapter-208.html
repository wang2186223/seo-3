                <p>Deep underground in Zerovia, hidden away from prying eyes, the Fist Guild&#39;s base throbbed with life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neon lights blinked in every shade imaginable, painting the walls in wild,shifting colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Music blasted so loud it rattled bones, while groups of hulking men crowded around tables, drinking and laughing. The whole place was chaos, but the kind that felt alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s phone buzzed with a message.He checked it and saw the transfer of one hundred million from Lainey. Lounging with his drink, he casually tossed his phone onto a table already buried in bottles and cards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of his lackeys crept closer, grinning. &#34;Boss,why bother keeping that chick alive? Let&#39;s just take her out and be done with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were barely out before Horace&#39;s hand cracked across his face. &#34;Idiot. Didn&#39;t I tell you? That woman&#39;s worth her weight in gold.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure, Lainey was a snake and probably hiding more tricks up her sleeve than she let on, but she had  spoken one truth-Eleanor wasn&#39;t just some random girl. She was Nolan&#39;s woman, and that made her priceless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her,he could bleed Nolan dry. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, Eleanor was also the Benton family&#39;s true daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he played his cards right, exposing that secret to the Bentons could rake in a jackpot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lackey rubbed his stinging cheek and bowed his head,stammering apologies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace waved him off, clearly bored. &#34;Is she up yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man nodded quickly. &#34;Yeah, boss. She came to her senses a while back. As soon as she woke, she knocked down several of our men without breaking a sweat. We only managed to restrain he after drugging her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That caught Horace&#39;s attention. His lips curled into a sly grin. &#34;A fighter, huh? Interesting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity got the better of him, and he pushed himself up, making his way toward the room where Eleanor was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Eleanor lifted her gaze, weak but sharp,her brows drawn tight. So this guy was Horace Boyd, the leader of the Fist Guild in Zerovia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been right all along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s dirty fingerprints were all over this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she studied Horace, he studied her right back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second his eyes landed on her, he froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about her face was familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reminded him of the woman who had beaten the hell out of him years ago before disappearing like smoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. That was impossible. It couldn&#39;t be her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking off the thought, Horace narrowed his eyes and focused on the woman sitting before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn, she was stunning. Way easier on the eyes than that snake Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about her carried that effortless poise women from her homeland were famous for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she held herself, the curves she couldn&#39;t hide..it was no mystery why Nolan had guarded her like a priceless gem. Getting her here hadn&#39;t been easy; his men had to pull off some serious work to snatch her up without Nolan breathing down their necks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The longer he stared, the more something twisted inside him. Desire mixed with greed. He crouched down so he was eye-level with her, his voice dripping with temptation. &#34;Pretty girl, how about a deal? Stick with me, and I&#39;ll let you live. I&#39;ll give you the good life.Money,power,whatever you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, on the other hand, was busy weighing her options. She had needles hidden on her, and for a second, the thought of taking Horace out flashed through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But logic kicked in quickly. What good would killing him do? The place was crawling with guards, and this was Zerovia, his domain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she got rid of him, she would never make it out alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rescue might take forever, and thinking she could escape on her own was nothing but a fantasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The safest option was to play along, at least for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, forcing her tension into a smile that lit up her face. &#34;Alright,&#34; she said sweetly. &#34;But where I come from, we don&#39;t do things halfway. If we&#39;re going to be together, there has to be a proper ceremony. Everyone needs to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace&#39;s eyes lit up like a kid in a candy shop. He let out a booming laugh. &#34;Ha! I&#39;ve heard all about your country&#39;s obsession with rituals. Fine then, sweetheart.You&#39;ll have your ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The underling standing off to the side felt his stomach drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ceremony? Making it public?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did the boss lose his damn mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his formidable wife ever got wind of this, he would be in for another storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone knew Horace both feared and respected that woman, yet his lecherous ways never changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, none of them dared speak up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They just hoped Horace&#39;s lust didn&#39;t drag the rest of them into hell with him.</p>
