                <p>Jeff stood in the living room, phone pressed to his ear,lines of worry etched into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steward from the Stewart family&#39;s estate spoke with a nervous edge in his voice on the other end of the call. &#34;Mr. Benton, I&#39;m truly sorry. Mr. Stewart grew so agitated that he fainted, and he&#39;s not in any condition to answer the phone right now. Please accept my sincere apologies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a heavy pause before Jeff finally replied,&#34;Please see to it that his needs are taken care of.l actually called to talk about breaking off my daughter&#39;s engagement to Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After turning it over in his mind, Jeff realized that dragging things out would only make matters worse.He had rather end it cleanly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The document he had reviewed had shaken him to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Norwood ever saw it, things would be worse. The fallout wouldn&#39;t stop with Lainey; it could tarnish the entire Benton family&#39;s name. Downstairs, Lainey had just reached the last step when she heard Jeff&#39;s words echo through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze, shock and anger flooding her features &#34;Why are you ending the engagement?&#34; she demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff set the phone down, sighing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started toward her, hand half-raised in comfort,before he stopped himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was gentler than she expected, almost cold in its restraint. &#34;Lainey, Nolan doesn&#39;t love you. If you forced this marriage, it wouldn&#39;t bring you any happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey was having none of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing her composure for the first time in front of Jeff, she lashed out. &#34;Who are you to decide what makes me happy? Didn&#39;t I tell you l care about him?I really do! If you won&#39;t fight for me, at least don&#39;t sabotage me behind my back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice cracked as she pushed on. &#34;Now I get it.I know you&#39;ve always looked down on me, just because I didn&#39;t grow up like everyone else, or because I&#39;m not the perfect daughter you pictured. But what did I do wrong? You&#39;re the ones who lost me, not the other way around!&#34; She had been on the verge of getting everything she wanted,and now Jeff was tearing it all apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was such a disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff listened to her outburst, sadness overtaking any frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew the pain in her words wasn&#39;t all her fault. In the end, it was the family who had failed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff let out a weary sigh, a heaviness settling over his words. &#34;Lainey, none of what happened in Zerovia is on you. If anyone should be apologizing, it&#39;s us. I&#39;ve made arrangements for us to go back to Breoqua.Once we&#39;re there, I promise to help you find someone who&#39;s your equal in every way, someone who truly deserves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t wait for a response. Turning away, he headed upstairs, leaving Lainey standing in the echo of his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned and motionless, she dug her fingernails into her palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zerovia? Did Ryland&#39;s report expose what she had done there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor ran through her body as dread crept in. Just how much had they figured out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That explained why Jeff had so suddenly backed out of transferring the shares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she couldn&#39;t risk going to Breoqua.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she set foot there, Fraser,who still carried a heavy grudge against her, would no doubt go out of his way to make things unbearable. He might even start running DNA tests behind her back every chance he got.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Panic clawed at her chest, but desperation sharpened her thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One ruthless idea took shape: if Jeff, Hilda,and Eleanor were all gone, she would be in line for the Benton inheritance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kind of fortune would force the Stewart family&#39;s hand; they would have to accept her, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Fraser and his brothers, they were oceans away and no threat to her plan. Once she secured her title as Nolan&#39;s wife and locked down the shares, nothing could touch her, even if old scandals surfaced later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Malice slowly overtook her fear, darkening her gaze with resolve. Upstairs, Hilda had just stepped out and caught sight of Lainey&#39;s twisted expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold shiver of unease crept over her. Whatever Lainey was plotting, she could feel the danger looming,but she had no idea what storm was about to break.</p>
