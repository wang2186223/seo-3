                <p>Lost in thought, Jonny gently held Lainey&#39;s hand and looked straight at Kurt. &#34;Kurt, Lainey&#39;s right. Even if that hundred million wasn&#39;t inthe picture, I&#39;d still treat her well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The matter was settled almost before anyone realized it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey couldn&#39;t help but picture herself as the wife of the CEO of a public company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made her pulse quicken with pride and anticipation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she would have everything she had dreamed of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as far as she was concerned, there was no longer any place for Eleanor in their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While they excitedly finalized wedding plans, Eleanor&#39;s world was anything but calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah&#39;s call had thrown a wrench into her plans. An unexpected inspection team had appeared out of nowhere, claiming Hope House was unsafe. It was old, precariously built on a seismic belt, and therefore a hazard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had ten days to relocate or face a forced eviction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor spent two sleepless nights sifting through every possible option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, with her apprentice&#39;s help, she found a suitable site. Relief should have washed over her,but it didn&#39;t. Lillian had come by to offer comfort, but her words only added to Eleanor&#39;s worries. &#34;Eleanor, isn&#39;t this land owned by the Stewart Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze and immediately pulled up the Qualen Estates files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she have forgotten? Qualen Estates was a Stewart Group subsidiary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, noticing Eleanor&#39;s stress, approached with a teasing grin. &#34;You and Nolan... you two seem pretty close. Why not just talk to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stiffened. Lillian had somehow let slip to Ryland about Nolan&#39;s supposed impotence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland, of course, had scolded her and then gone on about how men sometimes like to exaggerate their...abilities in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all added up. Nolan was definitely good in bed, and if Eleanor ended up with him, she would undoubtedly be happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian felt it was practically her duty to nudge them together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, meanwhile, shifted uncomfortably under Lillian&#39;s knowing gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Close?&#34; Eleanor echoed, a little sharp. &#34;I barely know him.&#34; But Lillian wasn&#39;t fooled. Her eyes sparkled mischievously. &#34;Come on, Eleanor, be honest. Are you hiding something from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be that Eleanor had shared secret moments with Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s cheeks burned as she shot Lillian a glare,exasperated. &#34;No. Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian raised an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to press further, Eleanor&#39;s phone buzzed.She checked it and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Qualen Estates refused to sell?&#34; Her expression darkened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian let out a small laugh. &#34;See? Fate is practically shoving you toward Nolan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave Eleanor&#39;s shoulder a playful pat. &#34;Too shy to make a move? Shall I set up a meeting for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor resisted visibly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t about someone arranging things for her. She had promised herself she would stay away from Nolan, and she wasn&#39;t about to dash into his arms now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride wouldn&#39;t let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian could see through the tough exterior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor was all resolve on the surface, but her heart was soft. For the sake of the orphanage, she would bend if she had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a playful nudge, Lillian pressed on. &#34;Oh, please,what&#39;s there to be scared of? Nolan isn&#39;t going to bite. And don&#39;t forget, that jerk of an ex-husband has already gone public with his engagement to Lainey,and the Todds and Gilberts are working together.If you don&#39;t take advantage of Nolan&#39;s power, you&#39;ll have to rely on the Enigma Group, and even if you move Hope House, they&#39;ll still manage to interfere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian had already heard that once the two families locked in their alliance, the Gilberts poured money into the Todd Group. Not long after, Hope House started facing problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Officially, it all looked unrelated, but she refused to believe the families didn&#39;t have a hand in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor considered this quietly and realized Lillian had a point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she didn&#39;t take the Gilberts or the Todds seriously, their constant meddling was a headache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More importantly, the frequent relocations weren&#39;t good for Myah or the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than risk exposing her identity using the Enigma Group&#39;s connections, it made more sense to leverage Nolan&#39;s influence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the situation served as a harsh reminder of her earlier bold claims.</p>
