                <p>Before she could even gather her thoughts, Eleanor was hoisted over Nolan&#39;s broad shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp gasp escaped her lips as she thrashed, fists hammering against his back. &#34;Nolan! Are you insane?Put me down! What about Lillian? What if she&#39;s left alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t respond, his long strides carrying her out of the bar. He paused only long enough to send a quick text to Ryland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stirred, blinking groggily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she saw Nolan lug Eleanor away, her face lit up. &#34;He actually forcibly took her! Oh my God, I love it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She grabbed a pillow, flopped back, and immediately passed out again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan carried Eleanor to his car, setting her into the passenger seat with ease. Before starting the engine, he spoke coolly. &#34;I&#39;ve already informed Ryland. You should be worrying about yourself, not your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine roared to life, and the car raced toward Regal Heights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once they were inside, the master bedroom door swung open on a sharp kick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t give Eleanor a moment to react before pressing her onto the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What followed was a storm of kisses-fierce, relentless, and all-consuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt herself suffocating under his intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How.could she remain so distant with him yet laugh and flirt with other men at a bar?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had waited for her and explained himself, and still she hadn&#39;t believed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she had chosen to trust Lillian&#39;s drunken chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea that she could be acting like this in front of another man sparked a jealousy in Nolan that he couldn&#39;t contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re impossible,&#34; he murmured, his hand brushing her skin, breath hot against her ear. &#34;How am 1supposed to handle you,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, flustered from being carried and cornered like this, bristled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible? She hadn&#39;t done anything to provoke this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anyone had been at fault, it was Nolan, for ignoring her while keeping another woman company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet now he acted as if she were the guilty one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger flared within her. She twisted her headto dodge his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes darkened. He cupped her chin, tilting her head back, and kissed her again, harder this time,as if to claim her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor felt overwhelmed, almost breathless under his intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she began to lose herself, a sudden shiver pulled her back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Summoning a strength she didn&#39;t know she had, she pushed him away, quickly got dressed, and stepped off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing over him, she glared at Nolan, whose eyes still burned with desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think I am?&#34; she asked, her voice shaking faintly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan noticed the small quiver and quickly stood up, wrapping her in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chin rested lightly on her shoulder, his warm breath brushing her neck. &#34;I... I just lost it,&#34; he muttered.&#34;Seeing him near you... it got to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor gently wrenched herself free, her eyes calm but firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was simply having a drink with him,&#34;she said evenly. &#34;And you couldn&#39;t handle it? Do you even realize how painful it&#39;s been watching you and Elora act like some perfect little couple all these past few days?&#34; There was nothing going on between Elora and him, yet he couldn&#39;t deny he had been distant with Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he said, earnest and earnestly. &#34;I won&#39;t let anyone come between us again. If Elora bothers you,I&#39;ll make sure she stays away.Always.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor hesitated, her thoughts darkening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora wasn&#39;t just a name. She was a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of how Nolan used to treat her clawed at her patience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw her at the mall a few days ago. She was helping Ady pick out shoes. You know exactly what that means.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elora&#39;s fragile recovery had kept her homebound. It was impossible that she wandered the mall,accompanied by Ady. Even the butler hadn&#39;t said a word about any trips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After pausing to think, Nolan spoke cautiously. &#34;Are you sure it was her? Could it have been someone else?&#34;Eleanor&#39;s lips curled into a brief, bitter smile. She didn&#39;t speak further. &#34;It&#39;s late. I should go,&#34; she said,already reaching for her coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan rushed after her, feeling as if her leaving was also taking her heart away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could take another step, his phone buzzed urgently. Hector&#39;s voice came through, sharp and anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir! There&#39;s trouble! Your father just arrived with a lawyer and several family members. He&#39;s demanding your grandfather divide the assets immediately. The security you arranged has been completely neutralized.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a second thought, Nolan bolted, leaving the room.</p>
