                <p>Lainey wasted no time after her performance at the Benton family&#39;s villa, eager to face the cameras and seize the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The press conference hall buzzed with anticipation. Reporters and photographers packed the space, every lens trained on the woman standing beneath the bright lights. She wore a simple black dress, her sorrow painted for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate everyone&#39;s concern. I promise to stay strong and carry out my parents&#39; wishes by leading the Benton Group with integrity,&#34; Lainey remarked with red-rimmed eyes, her tone quivering for effect. &#34;I will also be donating a portion of my inheritance to charity, in hopes of honoring my parents and bringing them peace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes went off as the reporters murmured in approval. Here was the heiress of the Benton family, carrying her loss with poise and still thinking of the greater good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few even whispered about her compassion and social responsibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lainey wasn&#39;t finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room erupted as Lainey shifted gears and delivered her next statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a slow, dramatic bow, she met the cameras head-on, her wide-eyed innocence almost too perfect. &#34;I need everyone here to keep an eye on the investigation. Why was Miss Eleanor Warren there that day? And is it possible her actions are connected to my parents&#39; deaths?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for a trembling breath, then continued, voice cracking, &#34;Out of respect for those we&#39;ve lost, I truly don&#39;t want to throw accusations around. All I&#39;m asking is for the Enigma Group and the police to explain what happened and help my family find some closure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers and flashes filled the air, the accusation barely disguised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s patience snapped. Shoving her way through the sea of reporters, she stormed the stage, fire blazing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re unbelievable, Lainey! How dare you twist things like this? If Eleanor really started the fire,why would she risk everything to run back in?&#34; Lillian retorted, voice ringing with outrage. &#34;You&#39;re turning the tables,blaming the innocent! Everyone&#39;s about to see what you&#39;re really like, and I won&#39;t let you fool them any longer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s fury only seemed to amuse Lainey, who stood her ground, a flicker of satisfaction breaking through her tearful expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Secretly, she relished the outburst. The louder Lillian grew, the easier it was to paint herself as the wounded party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her shoulders shake and took a faltering step backward, eyes wide with feigned terror as tears streaked down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Brooks; I understand your loyalty to Eleanor,&#34; Lainey said, voice trembling for effect. &#34;But please, put yourself in my shoes. I just lost my parents, and all I want is the truth. If Eleanor was truly innocent, then why was she at the scene that night? Can you give us a reason?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question landed like a stone, leaving Lillian speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth opened, but nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question echoed in Lillian&#39;s mind too-why had Eleanor shown up at the Benton family&#39;s villa in the first place?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She found herself at a loss, uncertainty swirling in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t deny it-if Eleanor had stayed away, she might still be alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every camera in the room focused directly on Lillian, turning her confusion into tomorrow&#39;s headlines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reporter after reporter murmured, their hushed voices filling the air with suspicion and doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t the Brooks girl acting way out of line right now?&#34; &#34;Seriously. Lainey just lost both her parents, and here comes Lillian making things even harder. There&#39;s not a shred of compassion in her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian thinks her family&#39;s money gives her a free pass to treat people however she likes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian heard every word, her hands trembling and her cheeks burning with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A firm grip suddenly caught her arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland appeared beside her, face set in a grim frown as he pulled his sister away from the crowd. &#34;That&#39;s enough,Lillian.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point, the entire room sympathized with Lainey, casting her in the role of the helpless victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any more drama would only give Lainey more support, and Ryland knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian wanted to argue, her lips parted for a retort, but the warning in her brother&#39;s eyes made her bite her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a shaky breath, Ryland finally turned to Lainey, forcing a polite apology.&#34;Miss Gilbert, please accept my apologies. My sister can be hotheaded. I hope you&#39;ll forgive her behavior.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey had no plans to let the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She delicately dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, shooting Lillian a look laced with disdain.&#34;Mr.Brooks, you might want to teach your sister how to behave. It&#39;s hard to see any grace or class in such unruly conduct, especially from someone raised in a family like yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every worddripped with sarcasm, her smile never reaching her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You!&#34; Lillian&#39;s anger threatened to boil over all ovêr again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland stepped in swiftly, forcing a strained smile as he seized her by the arm and steered her out of the spotlight.</p>
