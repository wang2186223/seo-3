                <p>Eleanor was about to nod when her phone vibrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at the screen made her pause. &#34;Sorry,Lillian, I&#39;ll have to take this. We&#39;ll catch up another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing Eleanor&#39;s status and the weight of her responsibilities, Lillian didn&#39;t protest. She released her arm with an easy grin. &#34;No problem, babe.Just promise to call me when you&#39;re free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian gave a cheeky wink before strutting off,lighthearted as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her friend disappear into the distance,Eleanor allowed herself a faint smile before lifting the phone to her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, the Stewart family just placed an order through the Underground Network. They&#39;re  demanding the Soul Surgeon, claiming they&#39;ll pay whatever it takes. Just now, they even raised the offer-money or otherwise, any terms can be negotiated. What&#39;s your decision?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s tone on the phone carried a clear hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, such requests came often, accompanied by staggering bids, some even reaching a billion.Eleanor had turned every single one away. It was hard to imagine this time being any different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the image of Nolan&#39;s uncharacteristically tense expression flashed across her mind, stirring something within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could this desperation be for Fannie?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s fingers tightened around the phone. Then,after a soft exhale, she gave her verdict. &#34;Accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, silence stretched before the woman blurted in disbelief, &#34;Boss...what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s face remained composed, her voice level. $100 million. And the location must be cleared. No one stays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her double identity had to remain buried. If Nolan lingered nearby, his sharp eyes might see through her facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman on the line was stunned. One hundred million?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was far less than what others had offered, yet this time Eleanor.relented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the gossip circulating in Elepdon true?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Eleanor somehow involved with Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dared not probe further. With respectful haste,she replied, &#34;Understood, boss. I&#39;ll make the arrangements.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Erick received the news, he could hardly contain his excitement. &#34;Mr. Stewart, the Soul Surgeon has agreed! They&#39;re only asking for $100million. The only condition is that no one can be present during the treatment.&#34; The money wasn&#39;t a problem. It was the stipulation that gave him pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fannie was the family&#39;s precious gem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of leaving her in the care of some mysterious doctor felt reckless. What if something went wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Erick reminded himself that people with real talent were often a little unusual, even eccentric. If this Soul Surgeon was as skilled as their reputation suggested, then perhaps trust was the only option.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ultimately, the choice wasn&#39;t his to make. It rested with Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes lingered on Fannie&#39;s pale, still figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long pause, his voice cut through the tension.&#34;Do it. Follow their terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, a woman dressed head to toe in black, her face hidden behind a silver mask, stepped into the hospital. Erick&#39;s eyes followed her as she entered the room.So this was the famous Soul Surgeon? He hadn&#39;t expected her to be this young, and a woman, no less.Appearances never told the whole story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, oblivious to his scrutiny, had already made her way to Fannie&#39;s bedside. She examined Fannie carefully, her brow knitting as the truth revealed itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So that was it. NNo wonder Fannie&#39;s body was so frail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rare genetic mutation had left her with a blood disorder so unusual it was scarcely recorded anywhere in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For most doctors, it was untouchable, impossible to cure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, Fannie had survived this long, thanks to the Stewart family&#39;s tireless efforts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, untreatable did not mean hopeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her compact kit, Eleanor produced needles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced precision, she inserted each one, channeling energy into the girl&#39;s weakened body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the procedure ended nearly half an hour later,the pallor on Fannie&#39;s cheeks had given way to a faint,healthy flush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor allowed herself a quiet breath of relief. At least part of her debt to Nolan had been lessened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tucked the girl in gently, then packed away her things and left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Outside, Erick, blindfolded as she had ordered,hurried to her side. &#34;Soul Surgeon, how is MMiss Stewart?&#34; His tone brimmed with restrained urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor answered evenly, &#34;Her state has stabilized.But this illness is congenital. Long-term treatment is required. This was only the first stage. She&#39;ll need two more sessions, once a week, before she can be fully healed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, someone had spoken with certainty about curing Fannie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Soul Surgeon&#39;s reputation was no exaggeration.  Ecstatic, Erick nearly bent in a full bow. &#34;Thank you!Thank you, Soul Surgeon! I&#39;ll see that your fee is delivered immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor only gave a small nod before vanishing down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the silence returned, Erick removed his blindfold and pulled out his phone, his hands trembling with excitement as he sent a message.&#34;Boss, Miss Stewart can be saved.&#34;</p>
