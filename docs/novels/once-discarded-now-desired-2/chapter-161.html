                <p>Eleanor remained unaware of everything unfolding at the Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Fannie swept her away from Hope House, she soon found herself standing in a villa she had never seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, something about the furnishings gave her a sense of déjà vu.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment they stepped inside, Fannie smacked her own forehead and bolted upstairs. &#34;Oh no,Eleanor! I totally forgot, I still have homework I need to finish!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this must be another one of the Stewart family&#39;s properties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Fannie had brought her here on Nolan&#39;s behalf. Eleanor&#39;s guess proved right. No sooner had Fannie disappeared upstairs than Nolan emerged from the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few days had passed since their paths last crossed at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan hadn&#39;t been avoiding her; Eleanor simply thought Norwood&#39;s recovery should come first.There would be time to reconnect once his health was no longer hanging in the balance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting around wasn&#39;t something Nolan could stand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved in close, every bit of his confidence on display. &#34;Did you miss me these past few days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor edged away, keeping her tone as cool as ever. &#34;If there&#39;s nothing important, I should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, Nolan raised his hand, putting on an exaggeratedly wounded look. &#34;You really have changed, haven&#39;t you? You don&#39;t even care anymore.&#34; She almost teased him for being over the top, but then she caught sight of his swollen, red hand, a sure sign of infection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he done this just for sympathy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would be just like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He noticed her skepticism and made himself look even more pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I got back, Grandpa punished me again. I&#39;ve barely eaten or slept since then, just thinking about you. My hand got worse. I never thought you&#39;d be the one to doubt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle mix of woodsy cologne and medicine clung to the air around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt washed over Eleanor, and her voice softened.&#34;Maybe... I should make dinner tonight to make it up to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left her mouth than an arm wrapped tightly around her waist.  The world spun for a moment and suddenly she was sitting on his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan bent close, his breath warm against her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My heart&#39;s in pieces. Do you really think one meal would be enough to fix that?&#34; he said, moving in for a kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Ryland burst through the door,waving a bottle of wine and grinning from ear to ear.&#34;Nolan, tonight we drink until we can&#39;t stand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick followed close behind, calm as always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor,flustered, scrambled to slip off Nolan&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on Ryland that he had barged in at exactly the wrong time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot Erick a look and mumbled, &#34;So, do you think we&#39;re too early or way too late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not wanting to get caught up in the mess, Erick grabbed Ryland by the wrist and started hauling him toward the door. &#34;Let&#39;s leave. Now.&#34;  Just as they arrived at the entrance, Erick paused, as if something had clicked in his mind. With clear hesitation, he turned back. &#34;Boss, this is the information you asked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a response, he turned and rushed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stared at the empty doorway, looking utterly defeated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just his luck., The one time he got Eleanor close, his friends had to ruin the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor found his glum face too funny to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sauntered over and slipped her fingers under his tie, giving it a gentle pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ended up just inches apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she looked up.&#34;So this is your idea of missing me so much you can&#39;t eat or sleep? You invite the whole crew to a party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t hide the teasing in her voice. Nolan opened his mouth to speak, but before he could say a word, someone slowly poked their head through the doorway, eyes scanning the room with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming back into view was Ryland, making yet another appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland kept his gaze fixed anywhere but on Nolan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, almost forgot. Jonny&#39;s been charged with domestic violence. Lainey&#39;s lawyer is handling the divorce now. Just thought you&#39;d want to know. Sorry for the interruption,again!&#34; He took off in a hurry, not wanting to give Nolan the chance to get even.</p>
