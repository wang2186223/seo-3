                <p>Eleanor&#39;s eyes flickered in Nolan&#39;s direction almost on instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her gaze collided with Nolan&#39;s, a jolt of surprise ran through her, and she instantly averted her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan seemed to have made it his mission to haunt her lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t wrap her head around how the head of the Stewart Group managed to find so much spare time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, entirely unaware of Eleanor&#39;s unease, grabbed Ryland&#39;s hand and said cheerfully,&#34;Ryland, look at this dress! Isn&#39;t it gorgeous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland glanced over, nearly laughing out loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a perfectly straight face, he played along. &#34;Hmm, there&#39;s definitely some unique symbolism there.Quite impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone suggested a compliment, but there was an underlying note of irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan let his gaze linger on Eleanor for a moment before turning his attention to Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally offered a verdict. &#34;Hmm.. she wears it like a saintly figure draped in shadows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he hadn&#39;t given Eleanor those loaded glances beforehand, people might have believed he was genuiely praising Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was an unspoken weight to his glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers of old scandals immediately sprang to mind for everyone nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey truly fit the image; after all, she had taken Eleanor&#39;s husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who else could play the part of a saintly figure shrouded in darkness? That meek,sorrowful act of hers made it all the more convincing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s face clouded with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were openly sabotaging his big day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But with the Stewart and the Brooks families wielding so much power, he was in no position to retaliate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he had known it would turn out like this, he never would have invited them to win them over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he was paying the price for his own ambition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s flawless makeup did nothing to hide the flush of embarrassment burning across her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten million had gone into that dress, only to become the butt of a joke!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was siding with Eleanor and twisting the knife on purpose!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian caught sight of Lainey&#39;s mortified look and knew exactly what was running through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned in, taking full advantage of the attention, and added in a sweet voice, &#34;If we&#39;re being honest, the gown is gorgeous, but the one in it... not quite as impressive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage bubbled up inside Lainey, and if Jonny hadn&#39;t been gripping her arm, she likely would have lashed out at Lillian right then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though frustration simmered beneath the surface, Jonny managed to keep his composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he couldn&#39;t challenge them directly, the best option was to retreat gracefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mustered a strained smile. &#34;Mr. Stewart, Mr. Brooks, please enjoy the celebration. Lainey and I have some things to attend to, so we&#39;ll excuse ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the couple moving away, the rest of the guests slowly began to scatter as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan now had a clear line of sight to Eleanor, who looked especially stunning tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling his unwavering attention, Eleanor grew a bit uneasy. Eleanor was about to pull Lillian along whena voice rang out in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nolan...&#34; Emma&#39;s tone was so sweet it was almost nauseating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great, so much for a quick escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was clearly more drama ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor and Lillian shared a knowing look, stopping in their tracks at the same moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy then flickered in Emma&#39;s eyes as she glanced their way, but she quickly masked it behind a dazzling smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing closer, she pretended to stumble and let out a theatrical gasp, aiming to fall right into Nolan&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to fling herself at Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nolan had zero patience for that kind of performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A look of clear annoyance flashed in his eyes as he quickly moved aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah!&#34; Emma tumbled to the floor, and her glass of red wine splattered perfectly across her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disaster, served up for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t resist a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan always had an army of admirers chasing after him, and this top fan was pulling out all the stops.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor casually folded her arms, eyeing Nolan with an amused, knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their eyes met, Nolan&#39;s lips twisted into a sly grin, a playful glint lighting up his expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, his usual polished expression vanished, replaced by something far more irreverent.</p>
