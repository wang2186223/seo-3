                <p>Hilda slid the envelope open before fishing out the crisp sheet of paper tucked inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her fingertips brushed the page, she jerked her hand back, as if the truth hidden there might scorch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heartbeat thundered in her ears, threatening to drown out every rational thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering what courage she had left, Hilda forced herself to scan the section with the test results.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze. &#34;Jeff Benton and Eleanor Warren, parent-child relationship-excluded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words didn&#39;t make sense. How could Eleanor not be their daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees buckled. Hilda nearly collapsed on the No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor had always looked just like her at that age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The connection she felt with that girl couldn&#39;t possibly be a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff&#39;s expression clouded with disappointment as he caught her, steadying Hilda&#39;s trembling frame. He reached into the envelope and pulled out another sheet. &#34;Don&#39;t panic yet, sweetheart. To be sure, I had them run a test with Lainey and me as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda barely processed his words, Hilda&#39;s eyes glazing over as she stared at the second report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phrase &#34;99.99% probability of parent-child relationship&#34; jumped out at her, sharp as a slap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her world spun out of control. Every ounce of strength seemed to drain from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This second piece of paper shattered her, leaving her  grasping for anything to hold on to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching Jeff&#39;s hand in a desperate, unyielding grip,she begged, &#34;There has to be some kind of mistake,right? Please tell me that&#39;s all it is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff wrapped his arms around her, rubbing her back as he tried to soothe her panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice broke as he answered, &#34;No mistake,Hilda.I made sure everything was supervised from start to finish. Nobody could have meddled with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a moment, then tried to offer some small comfort, as much for himself as for her. &#34;Lainey really is ours. And about Eleanor-remember,your brother lost a daughter years ago. Maybe there&#39;s a connection we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words trailed off, never making it to the end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda let herself drop onto the sofa, her gaze dull and unfocused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t bring herself to accept what she had just learned. Eleanor&#39;s calm eyes, that familiar expression, so much like her own, kept flickering through her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she not be her daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the corridor, Lainey had caught every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, those two were hopelessly trusting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They thought having a guard oversee the tests would guarantee everything was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only they realized the swap had happened before the samples ever left their sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horace had pulled off the switch from the very beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only these two would put that much faith in their own bodyguard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, their cluelessness worked in her favor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her place as a Benton was finally secure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next up was a divorce, a fat stack of shares, and marrying Nolan.  From that moment forward, her world would be wrapped in riches and comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Eleanor, what good was luck if she would never come out on top?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey barely had time to bask in her victory when Jonny&#39;s furious shout echoed up the stairs. &#34;Lainey!Get down here, now! What did you do with my sister?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of worry shot through her. Had Jonny uncovered something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he after her over Emma&#39;s disappearance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed to the door, anxious to head downstairs before he could cause more of a scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeff was quicker. He stepped into her path,offering a reassuring look. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, sweetheart.I&#39;ll take care of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a determined glare, he stormed down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left with no choice, Lainey followed, her heart pounding as she braced herself for what was to come.</p>
