                <p>Eleanor&#39;s cheeks flared crimson, the color spreading up to the tips of her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping herself out of it, she pulled back quickly from Nolan&#39;s hold, forcing space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faint trace of his warmth still clung stubbornly to her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Mr. Stewart. I&#39;ll be on my way now.&#34;Without waiting for his reply, she turned and rushed out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the second she crossed the threshold, she collided hard with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ouch!&#34; Lillian shouted, rubbing at her forehead before blinking in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of all people, it was her best friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor stood there flushed bright red, her eyes darting away, her breath uneven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s expression lit up instantly, her curiosity bubbling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hooked an arm around Eleanor&#39;s, eyes gleaming with mischief. &#34;Alright, out with it! Who&#39;s the guy you&#39;ve been hiding from me? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve gone and found yourself a new man already. Since when?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed on, &#34;Give me the details-what&#39;s he like? Is he some young heartthrob, or are you chasing after another older one this time? Either way, I get first say. I&#39;m not letting you fall for another disaster like Jonny again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From behind Eleanor, a tall shadow stretched forward as Nolan stepped into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression remained unreadable, his eyes gliding past Lillian before locking firmly on Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian&#39;s mischievous grin froze midair, then began to crumble piece by piece. She blinked hard, her mind racing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How on earth had Eleanor ended up tangled with Nolan of all people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And judging by the tension in the air, it wasn&#39;t just casual-they looked like two people caught in the middle of something... something way too intimate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When had Eleanor&#39;s taste taken such a dramatic turn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was the kind of man whose face alone could send a room spinning into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Ryland had sworn to her that Nolan was the coldest, most untouchable man in Elepdon-someone who wore bachelorhood like armor and had zero patience for romance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan was supposed to be like a star one admired from afar, dazzling and unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, this couldn&#39;t be happening. Eleanor had just escaped one disaster of a marriage -the last thing she needed was to get caught up with another man who spelled nothing but trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Eleanor desperately searched for a way to shut down Lillian&#39;s runaway imagination before it could spill from her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor waved her hands frantically, desperate to explain that nothing had happened. Whatever Lillian thought she saw, her relationship with Nolan was perfectly innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the panic in Eleanor&#39;s eyes only deepened Lillian&#39;s suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Lillian could launch into another round of questioning, Eleanor grabbed her hand and tugged her away in haste. &#34;Lillian, it&#39;s late already. We need to get to the exhibit hall before Mr. Gill starts wondering where we are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearly stumbling, Lillian allowed herself to be dragged along. Behind them, Nolan stayed exactly where he was,lips curling into the faintest amused smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This sly woman-every time she shed another layer of that careful disguise, she revealed something far more intriguing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exhibit hall was already buzzing, the excitement lingering long after David&#39;s appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the crowd finally began to scatter, Lillian seized her chance and circled right back to the topic she refused to drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eleanor, quit dodging. Confess and I&#39;ll go easy on you. Deny it and I&#39;ll drag it out of you. You and Mr.Stewart, locked in a room, and you came out blushing red like a schoolgirl? Don&#39;t tell me the two of you were just talking,&#34; Lillian said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s head spun under the assault of questions,her thoughts scrambling for a way out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was she supposed to explain that Nolan had simply helped treat her wound? Or that when she stumbled, he caught her to keep her from falling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew better. Any honest explanation would only fuel Lillian&#39;s wild imagination-and turn a harmless moment into a story far more scandalous.</p>
