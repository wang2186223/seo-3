                <p>Dinner ended with polite smiles and hollow words,each side hiding thoughts they dared not voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Lainey stepped back into the Todd family&#39;s villa, Jonny came barreling toward her like an eager puppy. &#34;Baby, tell me-did your parents agree?Will they put money into the Todd Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hopeful face made her sick. Investment? From the Benton family? He actually thought she would beg for his sake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she left, he had pressed her again and again to push the subject at the very first meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t that naive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bringing up money too soon would only sour the Bentons&#39; impression of her, and she couldn&#39;t risk that. She kept her mouth shut, knowing better than to say it straight to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stirring him up now would only bring trouble she didn&#39;t need.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Determined to hold her ground, Lainey lifted her chin and looked down at him with cold detachment. &#34;already brought it up. They told me they&#39;d make a decision once the Benton family is officially back in the domestic market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the confirmation he craved, but even that sliver of hope was enough to send Jonny into a frenzy of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disgusted by the sight, Lainey brushed past him and climbed the stairs without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She refused to waste any more of her time on him,not when only one day remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By tomorrow, she would finally walk out of the Todd family&#39;s villa for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was certain that once the welcome-home banquet concluded, the Benton family w/ould stand by her side when she filed for divorce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And at last, she would be rid of all the irritating people clinging to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning brought Jeff and Hilda to the Todd family&#39;s villa right on schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their car waited, Jonny and Vickie as well as Emma stepped outside to see Lainey off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie clutched Lainey&#39;s hand tightly, her reluctance written across her face. &#34;Lainey, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ve found your parents now. I hope you won&#39;t forget about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma wasted no time looping her arm through Lainey&#39;s, her voice rising with playful insistence.&#34;Count me in too, Lainey! You&#39;re not allowed to forget me either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheer in her tone only sharpened Jonny&#39;s scowl as he shot both women a wary look, afraid they might plant the wrong words in Lainey&#39;s ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He jumped in hastily, eager to smooth things over.&#34;Stop saying things like that. Lainey&#39;s thoughtful and kindhearted. She&#39;d never turn her back on us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their cloying attention made Lainey&#39;s stomach twist but she kept her lips curved in a practiced smile,offering only the smallest nod in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over her once she finally slipped into the gleaming Rolls-Royce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a farce.,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had risen too high to ever look back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Todd family weren&#39;t even fit to polish her shoes,much less earn her forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every bit of her loathing sat heavy behind her poised expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting beside her, Hilda caught the flicker of disdain in Lainey&#39;s eyes. Her fingers tightened against her lap, and a quiet certainty bloomed inside her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That girl wasn&#39;t hers. She could feel it in her bones. Her real daughter would never be so calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff, blind to it all, carried on without suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A night of brooding had chased away every doubt in his mind, and now he gazed at Lainey with wide-eyed joy, convinced he had finally found the daughter he lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the car rolled to a stop, he sprang out with energy, hurrying to the other side. &#34;Here, Lainey. Let me carry youur things. Careful now, watch your step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey basked in the warmth of affection that was never truly hers, her lips curving as she remarked,&#34;Thanks, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned, her eyes landed on Hilda, still seated in the car with a faraway look clouding her face. Stepping closer, Lainey slipped her hand around Hilda&#39;s arm. &#34;Mom, what&#39;s on your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden touch jolted Hilda back to herself.She masked the unease in her eyes with a practiced smile. &#34;It&#39;s nothing, dear. I was only wondering what we should wear to the welcome-home banquet next week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea flickered through Lainey&#39;s mind. &#34;Mom, have you heard of Enigma? Everyone&#39;s talking about her right now. Why don&#39;t we ask her to design something special for the two of us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hilda&#39;s brows knitted as she recalled the name. She had heard of the designer&#39;s strict rules, and worry tugged at her expression. &#34;But the banquet is in just a week. Can&#39;she even do it in time? Besides, she doesn&#39;t usually take custom dress orders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s confidence never wavered. Her smile carried a knowing edge. &#34;That doesn&#39;t matter. If the money is right, she&#39;ll agree. People always do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Faced with her certainty, Hilda gave in with a small nod. &#34;Very well. Handle it yourself. Just let me know the cost, and I&#39;ll wire it to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, Lainey pressed against her with an affectionate tilt of her head. &#34;Mom, you really are the sweetest.&#34; Inside, a thrill sparked through Lainey&#39;s veins. Her chance for revenge against Eleanor was close at hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, she would walk into that banquet draped in a gown crafted by Eleanor&#39;s own hands, standing proudly among Eleanor&#39;s true relatives, dazzling as the center of attention. The image of Eleanor&#39;s humiliation brought a rush of excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan might stand at Eleanor&#39;s side, but Lainey believed one truth above all-bloodlines and family prestige would always eclipse borrowed power. And in that arena, Eleanor would never measure up.</p>
