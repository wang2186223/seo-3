                <p>Nolan didn&#39;t spare Lainey another look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he gave Erick a faint nod, who immediately caught the signal and lifted the small remote in his hand and pressed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint whir, a white screen unrolled at the front- of the hall, and the projector blinked to life. Soon enough, a video appeared, clear for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It showed a hospital room, where Lainey was holding a woman by the hair and slashing her face again and again with a dagger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her crazed grin and twisted expression made her look nothing like the refined socialite everyone thought she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the scene, gasps exploded through the mourners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that Lainey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she actually kill someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s eyes locked on the screen, her blood running cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,this couldn&#39;t be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did this come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who fiImed it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind screamed denial, but her lips faltered before she shrieked, &#34;No! No, this is fake! It&#39;s a setup!Someone used Al to create this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the murmurs could settle, another voice boomed across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about the fire in my house?&#34; Everyone froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voice belonged to Jeff. The man who was supposed to be dead walked through the doors, calm and commanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the guests instinctively stepped back, a path opened wide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And down that path came not just Jeff, but Hilda... alive, radiant despite everything. And behind them was Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The three of them, alive and breathing, walked straight into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room exploded with disbelief. How? The fire had consumed everything. How could they have possibly survived?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s head spun, and her mouth worked faster than her brain. Before she could stop herself,she blurted,&#34;Dad... Mom...you&#39;re supposed to be dead!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words dropped like a bomb in the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face drained instantly when she realized what had just slipped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrambling to cover her tracks, she shot a finger at Eleanor and shrieked like a madwoman, &#34;This is all your doing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, as if to erase her blunder, she stumbled forward and clutched Jeff&#39;s hand with a pitiful expression.&#34;Dad,thank heavens you&#39;re alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jeff recoiled instantly and yanked his hand away as if her touch burned. The look he shot her was pure disgust. &#34;You really wanted me and Hilda gone, didn&#39;t you? So you could snatch everything we worked for!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, what? No,what are you even saying?&#34; Lainey stuttered, trying to keep her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jeff gave a cruel laugh, his voice cold and sharp. &#34;Lainey Gilbert, your acting&#39;s gone on long enough. It&#39;s pathetic.&#34;	=</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, Hilda, her eyes blazing with anger, came forward. She pulled out a stack of papers from her bag and flung them at Lainey. They smacked her square in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;DNA results,&#34; Hilda spat. &#34;They prove you&#39;re not our daughter. Eleanor is. Always was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest heaved as she glared at Lainey. &#34;And I heard you on the phone with the bastard who set our house on fire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor moved up beside her, her tone cutting and cold. &#34;Horace from the Fist Guild already spilled it all. He admitted you paid him to mess with the DNA reports. Lainey, you&#39;ve run out of excuses. Everything&#39;s out in the open now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall broke out in shocked whispers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s been lying this,whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She didn&#39;t just pretend to bé Jeff&#39;s daughter, she actually tried to burn them alive. What kind of monster does that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. If Jeff and his wife had really died, Lainey would&#39;ve gained everything. The way she plotted it all out is terrifying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that video earlier... she killed someone! She&#39;s insane!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey&#39;s ears buzzed as the room closed in around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her carefully built life, being Nolan&#39;s wife, inheriting the Bentons&#39; wealth, being envied by everyone-it was all slipping through her fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in her mind, one name burned brighter than anything else. Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bitch had ruined everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, her grip on reality snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes went bloodshot, her face contorted with madness. She let out a wild, piercing scream and charged straight at Eleanor with a knife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I can&#39;t have it, neither can you! Eleanor, I&#39;ll end you right here!&#34; Eleanor&#39;s gaze hardened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She braced herself, ready to move, but before she could react, a figure darted in front of her, shielding her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Hilda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor froze, horror ripping through her chest. Her cry tore out, raw and desperate.&#34;No!&#34;</p>
