                <p>Quiet settled over the living room once again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, amused smile played on Eleanor&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lainey and Jonny were battling it out in court?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of it mattered to her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let go of Nolan&#39;s tie and stepped away, putting some space between them. &#34;I&#39;m heading to the kitchen. Don&#39;t move from there,&#34; she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could take a step, his hand slipped around her wrist, gentle but unyielding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan wouldn&#39;t let go, clinging as if the slightest gap would make her disappear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a weary sigh, Eleanor gave in. &#34;Changed your mind about dinner?&#34; she asked, eyebrow raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did Nolan finally release her hand. Downstairs again, Fannie appeared out of nowhere,filling the space with her cheerful chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Nolan was still recovering, Eleanor stuck to cooking light, homemade dishes that were easy on the stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Fannie savored every bite, Nolan barely noticed his plate; his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He found himself stealing glances at Eleanor again and again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simple food, shared company, Nolan realized this was what home truly felt like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after the meal, he refused to part with Eleanor,insisting that she keep him company while he worked through some papers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, with no other choice, waited patiently by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not until the night had stretched on did Nolan finally give in, choosing to drive Eleanor home himself. They pulled up in front of her apartment building, the car rolling to a quiet stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor clicked off her seatbelt, eased the door open, and stepped out. &#34;Get home safe, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan stayed quiet, not moving an inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced back, confused, and found him watching her with the saddest eyes-a look that could melt anyone&#39;s resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Light from the streetlamp spilled through the window, softening his features and leaving him with the expression of a lonely pup watching someone walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here he went again with those sad eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor couldn&#39;t help feeling a mix of annoyance and affection. She leaned across the console, pressed a quick kiss to his lips, and said, &#34;There, now head home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Nolan could process what had happened,she slipped out of the car, closed the door behind her, and hurried into the apartment building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved with quick, seamless grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan sat there, watching her figure disappear into the distance. His fingers brushed his lips, lingering on the warmth she left behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scent and the feel of her kiss lingered, refusing to fade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He.stayed frozen for a moment, then an involuntary smile crept across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t wait for the day when they would be married, then he could watch her walk in beside him instead of leaving him behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, he knew Eleanor valued her independence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t the type to settle for anything that felt like a cage. Convincing her to take that step with him wouldn&#39;t be easy, and the journey ahead promised to be anything but simple. The night passed in peaceful silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, Eleanor slipped back into her routine,heading to Hope House to see the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life had been hectic, leaving her with little time for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, the kids had clung to her,complaining that she didn&#39;t care for them anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her schedule finally clear, she made up her mind to spend the whole day there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor started her day at the mall, picking out bags full of toys, then hopped into a cab and headed straight for Hope House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had she set the bags down than Myah called her over, &#34;Eleanor, a woman came asking about you yesterday. She&#39;s been here before, and l think she has something important to discuss. Here&#39;s her number. Reach out whenever you have time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myah didn&#39;t bring up their striking resemblance To her, nothing revealed the truth quite like meeting face-to-face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Hilda really was Eleanor&#39;s mother,they would feel it in their hearts the moment they met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not, there was no point in stirring up anxiety with guesses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor, completely unaware that the woman was Hilda,saved the contact without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flashed Myah a quick smile. &#34;Thanks, Myah. I&#39;m going to play with the kids now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning passed in a blur of games and laughter.Just before lunch,Eleanor sent a quick message to the number, arranging a meeting at Verdant Crest.</p>
