                <p>Jonny froze, staring at Eleanor in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had laid out such enticing terms, yet she still turned him down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What more could she possibly want? The title of his wife?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Absurd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That spot was reserved for Lainey, and Lainey alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swiped the blood from the corner of his lips, fury flashing in his eyes. &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t push your luck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lunged toward her,trying to claim her lips by force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Revulsion surged through Eleanor. She shoved him back with all her strength.&#34;JOnny, where do you get the guts for this? Do you think you&#39;re some kind-of sultan with a harem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regained her composure and continued, &#34;Let me spell it out one last time. I&#39;m not pretending to play hard to get. I just don&#39;t love you anymore. That&#39;s it. So drop the narcissistic act and go be with your darling Lainey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze swept him from head to toe before she flashed him a cold smile. &#34;Frankly, a manipulative man and a shameless woman make a perfect pair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit Jonny like knives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today, he had humbled himself, come down from his lofty perch, and even waited here, just to give her a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she had only admitted fault, he might have allowed her back into Todd Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she spat in his face with stubborn defiance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stubborn. Insolent. Who gave her that right? His jaw clenched, voice low with venom. &#34;Don&#39;t forget, Eleanor! You only grew up with the support of Todd Group!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laughed coldly. &#34;Wrong. That credit belongs to Sallie, who supported me and the orphanage.I owe her everything.And you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes hardened. &#34;If you keep showing up in front of me, I won&#39;t hesitate to let those photos see daylight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, she slid her card and stepped into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny&#39;s legs twitched to follow, but he stopped short.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photos wouldn&#39;t ruin him, but they would humiliate him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made his stomach churn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. What was Eleanor really after?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she being so impossible now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be true that she had stopped loving him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A woman who had loved him for three years didn&#39;t just walk away overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she had to be angling for more-still dreaming of becoming his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But let her dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That title belonged to Lainey, and no one else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonnystormed toward his parking spot, his temper boiling over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he got there, the space was empty. His sleek black sedan was nowhere in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the fuck? Where did it ggo?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could a whole car just vanish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His rage was about to spill over when a man in uniform stepped out from the shadows, with a small notebook in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Todd?&#34; the officer asked, handing him a slipof paper. &#34;Your vehicle was parked in a fire lane and has been towed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny froze, staring at the ticket. What kind of nonsense was this? Since when had he parked in a fire lane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if he had, who would dare to report him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He snatched the ticket and crushed it in his fist. &#34;Who the hell reported me? Do they have a death wish?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The veins in his neck stood out as his face twisted with fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The officer didn&#39;t so much as blink. &#34;Sorry, that information is confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he took his leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jonny was left seething. He might have been a president of a listed company, but in a city overflowing with power players, he wasn&#39;t anyone special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, the one who filed the report was Nolan&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That officer might have been low in rank, but he wasn&#39;t stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew very well who it was safe to offend and who it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, Jonny had broken the law. This time, he couldn&#39;t cry unfair.</p>
