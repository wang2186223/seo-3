                <p>The taxi pulled up infront of the Enigma flagship store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor paid the fare and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shop stood in darkness, looking deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Lillian pulling another prank?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that thought, she pushed open the glass door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lillian, are you here?&#34; Her voice echoed as she groped for the switch on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before her hand reached it, the room bloomed with light-not from overhead bulbs, but from candles flickering to life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A long red carpet stretched from the entrance to the far end,lined with people in Enigma fan apparel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every one of them held a single red rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first girl stepped forward and offered a flower.&#34;Wishing you happiness,Enigma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then another, and another. One by one, fans placed roses into Eleanor&#39;s arms,each with warm blessings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon the bouquet in her arms grew heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Nolan&#39;s proposal at the Hope House surfaced in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So this was why he had been so busy? Had he been planning another proposal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought melted away her irritation over Elora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end,Lillian stepped forward with the final rose,her grin wide and playful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well? Surprised? Didn&#39;t expect this, did you?&#34; She wiggled her brows proudly, secretly hoping for praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had worked for days under Nolan&#39;s orders-even broke a nail-to make this happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor laughed at her friend&#39;s antics.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the bouquet, she instinctively looked down the carpet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian, understanding, stepped aside. The stage was ready for the main character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone&#39;s eyes turned toward the empty space,waiting for Nolan. A minute passed. Then another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no one appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The end of the carpet stayed silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A restless murmur swept the crowd, turning sweetness into awkwardness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s smile faltered. She clutched the roses tighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, Besty burst inside, heels clicking sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Stewart and his sister got a call and rushed out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fans traded uneasy glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What could be more important than a proposal?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Poor Enigma.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s gut told her Elora was involved. But in the end, it came down to Nolan not putting her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little. Broken?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not quite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She realized she could no longer pin her hopes on love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night had unfolded like their relationship itself-surprise,romance, anticipation, then disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her face, Lillian rushed forward. &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t think too much. Maybe... Maybe Nolan really had an urgent matter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fans chimed in quickly, &#34;Yeah! Don&#39;t be upset,Enigma.He must have been delayed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right-we trust Mr. Stewart!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor forced a smile at their comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sad, just humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abandoned in front of a crowd-how could she not feel embarrassed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about to excuse herself when a mocking voice cut through the room. &#34;Well,well...Mr. Stewart already bored of you? Looks like your charms aren&#39;t what they used to be.&#34; Eleanor turned to see Vickie at the door,arms crossed, smirking with glee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had come for the mall sales, planning to impress other society wives, but instead heard the gossip about Nolan leaving mid-proposal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her,Eleanor deserved the humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor ignored her, heading straight to Besty to dismiss the fans and have small gifts prepared for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lillian wouldn&#39;t let Vickie&#39;s words slide. She strode up,eyeing her from head to toe. &#34;Mrs. Todd? Why are you wearing last season&#39;s clothes? Didn&#39;t you swear you&#39;d never touch out-of-date fashion?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tlted her head,smiling wider. &#34;Oh,right-I forgot.Your family&#39;s bankrupt. Who knows how long what&#39;s left will last? Next time I see you begging on the street, maybe I&#39;ll toss you a tip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vickie&#39;s face burned red. If not for Eleanor, they wouldn&#39;t have fallen so low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once proud, now she had to scavenge through sales racks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shot Eleanor a venomous glare but left in fury,though vengeance still brewed in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian huffed in satisfaction, only to notice Eleanor already outside, raising her hand for a cab. Her chest  tightened, and she hurried after her. &#34;Eleanor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor turned back with a calm smile. &#34;I&#39;m fine. Don&#39;t worry.Go home,too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A taxi pulled up, and she slipped inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian stood on the curb, stomping in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it-where had Nolan gone at such a moment?</p>
