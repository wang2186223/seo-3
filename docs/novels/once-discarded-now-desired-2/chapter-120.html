                <p>Besty marched into the garage, her frustration plain as day, and found her car sitting on four flat tires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her jaw, certain it was the same man she had just met. he was going out of his way to impress Lainey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What a moron.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone as conniving as Lainey couldn&#39;t possibly be the real daughter of the Benton family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She would get what she deserved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Besty couldn&#39;t ignore the deep sense of disgust churning in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could leave the car behind, a flash of headlights cut through the dim garage. A sleek car pulled up. The window slid down,revealing a relatively striking face. It was no doubt Ryland.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having car trouble?&#34; Ryland asked, his arm resting casually over the steering wheel as he gave her a knowing look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hadn&#39;t forgotten Besty, the director at Eleanor&#39;s store and a favorite topic in Lillian&#39;s stories, always described as lovely, warm-hearted, and capable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of Lillian and out of respect for Nolan,Ryland felt compelled to step in to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief softened Besty&#39;s stiff posture as she recognized him. &#34;Yes. Could you just take me to the store? I&#39;ll handle the car situation later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland kept silent, reaching over to unlock the passenger door without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After offering a quick thanks, Besty slid into the seat beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made their way to the shop, and as Besty was about to step out, something popped into her mind.She rummaged through her purse, pulled out a fancy invitation stamped with gold, and held it out. &#34;Oh almost forgot, Mr. Brooks. Lainey wanted me to give this to Eleanor. I&#39;m not sure when Eleanor will drop by, so can you pass it along? I appreciate it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ryland accepted the invitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Running his thumb over the elegant gold details, he let out a low scoff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He thought to himself that Lainey had some nerve,always trying to agitate Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later on, Nolan ended up handing the invitation to Eleanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drummed his fingers on the tabletop and gave Eleanor a sly grin. &#34;So, are you planning to go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor picked up the envelope, barely glanced at it,and set it back down with little interest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered evenly, &#34;Of course. Why wouldn&#39;t I? If Lainey wants to put on a performance for me, I&#39;ll play along.Besides, it&#39;s a perfect opportunity to connect with people and line up new sponsors for my foundation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though she had a certain reputation as Enigma,there were still plenty of affluent people she hadn&#39;t reached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fan support could only go so far. In the end,everything hinged in the favor of influential socialites and business leaders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that in mind, Eleanor saw no downside to attending the event.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lainey wanted to parade around and flaunt her status, Eleanor was happy to let her have the spotlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan listened to her calm reasoning, and the chill in his gaze faded, replaced by a warm, affectionate grin. &#34;In that case, let&#39;s go pick out some matching clothes. That way, everyone will know we&#39;re together.&#34; He hated the thought of strangers, unaware of their relationship, setting their sights on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her charm, he felt the urge to make sure everyone knew she was spoken for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor blinked in surprise at his suggestion, but realization quickly dawned on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would have guessed that the mighty CEO of the Stewart Group could have such a heightened sense of crisis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing struck her as both funny and a little endearing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,&#34; she agreed with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had actually hoped to make her own dress this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Lainey&#39;s urgent request for a set of mother-daughter outfits had completely filled up her schedule.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That being the case, she figured picking up  something from a boutique would be more than enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been ages since Nolan enjoyed a real date with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she gave her consent, he wasted no time dropping his paperwork as he eagerly took her by the hand and led her out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They made quite the impression, drawing glances and whispers from nearly everyone they passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After snagging their coordinated outfits, they suddenly found themselves at the center of a fan gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really Nolan with Enigma? I can&#39;t believe it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;ls this a date? You two look so cute together!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you mind if we took a picture with you guys?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their supporters were clearly thrilled but made sure to keep a polite distance, content to simply be close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cheerful buzz was soon interrupted by someone shouting over the crowd. &#34;Move aside! Mrs. Todd needs to get through!&#34;</p>
