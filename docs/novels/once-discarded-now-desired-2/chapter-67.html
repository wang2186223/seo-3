                <p>Emma was overwhelmed by pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing herself off the floor with a pained expression, she leaned toward Nolan and whispered in a sweet tone, &#34;Nolan, I&#39;m really hurting. Won&#39;t you rub it for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lillian broke into uncontrollable laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really? That tired trick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Emma honestly think Nolan was some clueless schoolboy who would fall for it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s reaction was immediate-his look of disgust deepened, leaving no doubt about what he thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rushned to Emma&#39;s cheeks, the sting of humiliation twisting quickly into rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed her heel against the floor and snapped through clenched teeth, &#34;Eleanor, don&#39;t act so pleased with yourself! Lainey&#39;s the one in the spotlight today!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That reminder seemed to revive her boldness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Humph! Besty Juarez from the Enigma Group is coming too. Lainey&#39;s gown was custom-made by her.I doubt a country bumpkin like you has even heard of Enigma!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter if Eleanor had managed to stick close to Lillian and Nolan?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, she was still Jonny&#39;s castoff, a woman thrown aside without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t belong here. She didn&#39;t deserve Nolan&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Emma,Eleanor would always be nothing more than a country bumpkin pretending to fit in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s nails dug into her palm as fury twisted inside her. She would rip off that mask and show everyone exactly what kind of bitch Eleanor really was. &#34;I see.&#34; Eleanor&#39;s reply came smooth and deliberate, her lips curving into the faintest smirk. &#34;And what exactly does that prove?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s chest tightened with fury, the casual dismissal nearly knocking the breath from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How dared this bitch act so unbothered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she truly not take Besty seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She really was nothing more than an ignorant country girl pretending to belong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Emma could snapback, a voice rang out from the crowd, sharp with exctement. &#34;Besty&#39;s here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The spectators shifted instantly, clearing a neat path through the gathering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A poised woman in a tailored suit strode forward, her presence commanding attention. Several assistants trailed close behind, underscoring her authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Besty-head of Enigma&#39;s Elepdon branch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma&#39;s eyes brightened as if salvation had arrived. Straightening her posture, she hurried forward and put on her most flattering smile. &#34;Besty, thank God you&#39;re finally here! You won&#39;t believe the arrogance I&#39;ve just witnessed. Someone thinks Ms. Brooks&#39; support gives her the right to dismiss you-and Enigma itself!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma threw her hand out, pointing squarely in Eleanor&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She even pushed Ms. Brooks to mock Enigma&#39;s entire design philosophy! She said Lainey&#39;s dress carries a terrible meaning. People like her don&#39;t belong here. You can&#39;t just ignore this. Honestly, I think Enigma should blacklist her completely-make sure she never buys another piece from you again!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rose higher with every word, her outrage feeding on itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besty&#39;s expression tightened as she listened, her eyes narrowing while she turned to follow where Emma was pointing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight nearly made her knees give out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That wasn&#39;t just some guest-it was Enigma. The founder. The hidden force behind Enigma Group itself. The others might stil be blind to Eleanor&#39;s true Identity, but Besty cotad never mistake hee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago, when she was nothing more than a salesghl iy ono of Enigma&#39;s bortiquies, that very woman hed pluckod her from obscurlty and set her on the path that fed to her cirtont post.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forgest ignoring her. Even i Eleanor ohose to grind her under her heet, Besty wouldn&#39;e dare so much ad breathe a complalrt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold sweat broke aoross Besty&#39;s forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, ready to greet Eleanor, when a floeting look from her stopped her cold. That subtle,knowing glance carried a clear message-Eleanor had no intention of revealing who she really was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ft her perfectly; the woman had aways moved in shadows, never craving the spotllght.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she wlshed to remain unseen, then she would play along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Masking her shock, Beaty smoothed her expression and swiveled back toward Emma. &#34;Miss Todd,you can&#39;t be serious. Perhaps you&#39;ve had a little too much to drink, because what you&#39;re saying is nothing but foolishness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emma was certain she had just outmaneuvered Eleánor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had no idea that her own words were about to come back and destroy her in front of everyone.</p>
