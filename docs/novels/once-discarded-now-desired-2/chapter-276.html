                <p>As the tension coiled within Nolan began to unwind,his phone pierced the calm with Hector&#39;s urgent call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr.Stewart! Your grandpa is gravely ill!&#34; Hector&#39;s voice trembled with panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan felt a chill course through him, his voice quivering as he pressed. &#34;What has happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobs choked Hector&#39;s words on the other end. &#34;It&#39;s Brodie. He returned briefly, shared a few heated words with your grandfather in the study, and moments after he left, your grandfather fainted!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s eyes blazed with fury and fear as he ended the call. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, he bolted for the door, his heart pounding with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing his grandfather was unthinkable. Eleanor, witnessing his frantic departure, felt her chest tighten. Instinctively, she snatched a coat from the sofa and raced after him. &#34;I&#39;m coming with you,&#34;she called out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They arrived at the Stewart family&#39;s estate in a whirlwind, Nolan charging into the main bedroom with desperate urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seized the arm of Norwood&#39;s doctor, his voice sharp.&#34;How is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor turned, his face etched with solemnity and shook his head. &#34;Mr. Stewart, I&#39;m afraid you must brace for the worst. His age and frail health make this shock too great to bear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan&#39;s sturdy frame swayed, nearly crumpling under the weight of the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor steadied him, her gaze shifting to the frail figure on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Norwood&#39;s time was slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Eleanor&#39;s medical prowess was renowned she harbored doubts about saving him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she couldn&#39;t stand idly by, not when Nolan faced such a devastating loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With unwavering determination, Eleanor opened her acupuncture kit and approached the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands danced with precision, placing needles until Norwood&#39;s form resembled a pincushion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor gaped, astonishment widening his eyes.&#34;Miss Warren, what are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To his disbelief, Norwood&#39;s pallor began to warm, a soft flush returning to his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that even possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t this the kind of miracle only the Soul Surgeon could perform?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,was Eleanor the Soul Surgeon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon realizing this, the doctor stood in stunned disbelief. No longer concealing her skill,Eleanor removed the needles and began another round of meticulous acupuncture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Norwood coughed violently, his eyelids fluttering open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against all odds, he had pulled through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor stood in awe, his admiration for Eleanor boundless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nolan, overcome with relief, clasped Norwood&#39;s hand tightly. &#34;Grandpa, how are you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As their heartfelt exchange unfolded, Eleanor quietly gathered her kit and slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sensed that, apart from Trudy, she was likely the last person Norwood wished to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus,she was loath to provoke him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she approached the front door, a sardonic voice sliced through the stillness. &#34;Miss Warren, your performance was nothing short of spectacular.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie had appeared unnoticed, lounging against the wall with a derisive smirk playing on his lips. &#34;But what does it avail you to save him? In his eyes, you&#39;ll forever be the unwelcome shadow. As long as he lingers, you and Nolan can never get married.Doesn&#39;t that chafe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew nearer, bending to whisper in her ear,his tone thick with cajolery. &#34;Moreover, Nolan&#39;s on the brink of ruin. Why tether yourself to a sinking ship?Why not jump to a steadier deck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Eleanor&#39;s lips curved into a smile,though her eyesglinted with frost, her voice sharp with mockery.&#34;Are you so certain of that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie straightened, flicking his hair from his brow with a return to his habitual nonchalance. &#34;The tax scandal is ironclad. Nolan&#39;s trapped, and even if he wriggles free, the Stewart Group is a wounded giant,destined never to reclaim its former splendor!&#34; Eleanor found his cocksure attitude almost comical.&#34;lf the Stewart dynasty crumbles, do you truly believe you, an illegitimate child, and your spineless father will emerge unscathed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her stare turning glacial. &#34;And what makes you think Nolan stands alone in this fight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &#34;What are you implying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eleanor&#39;s smile was enigmatic as she replied, &#34;All in good time,you&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance his way, she slipped into the waiting car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brodie&#39;s taunts were nothing but the bluster of a feckless fool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dismissed them without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her true concern lay with the formidable Perry family,particularly the influential Tyler, Trudy&#39;s grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With resolve, Eleanor directed the driver in a calm,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>clear voice, &#34;To the Elepdon Sanatorium.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well,&#34; the driver replied with a nod, setting the car in motion.</p>
