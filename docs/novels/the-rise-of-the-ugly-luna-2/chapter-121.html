                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How bad could a person&#39;s life get? How unlucky could one person be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta had these questions running through her mind as she ran out of her car. She had been driving at a crazy speed, she nearly ran into a truck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wouldn&#39;t have cared if she did. At the moment, she&#39;d rather be dead than live this nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents, grandmother and Penelope were at the terrace when she arrived. They seemed to be having a conversation and stopped when they saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta wasn&#39;t the only one that looked worried. She&#39;d never seen her grandmother more upset before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; The word fell from her lips with pain. &#34;I saw her yesterday,&#34; Penelope started with a sigh.&#34;To my surprise, she&#39;d been looking for me for five years. I couldn&#39;t recognize her because... she looked beautiful. Clearly, she found a way to get rid of the scar. She wanted to know where I buried the kids,but fortunately, I found a way to discard her. So,when I left her, I did my research and got to know she was Alpha Jaris&#39; mate.&#34; She shrugged. &#34;The same man you gave the kids to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, what are the odds?&#34; Her father mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute, Marta was as still as a statue,dumbstruck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers dived into her hair as she pulled at her roots, frustration kicking in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; she muttered. &#34;It can&#39;t be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her bag slipped from her hand but she didn&#39;t even care to pick it up. She started pacing the terrace on shaky legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was their mother. The same Lyric she hated. The same Lyric Jaris had a soft spot for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The same Lyric her kids preferred over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No. No.&#34; She shook her head repeatedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears marked her face. Terrified ones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was researching on Siphoning when the kids came to see me. They told me they were bored and wanted to play with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I wouldn&#39;t say I was surprised. It was crazy how we&#39;d grown close over the months. I&#39;d be lying if l said I didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They took their toy airplanes and went with me to the garden. It was night, but the garden had these beautiful lights that were on display at night. The lights were one of the reasons I enjoyed coming to the garden when it was dark. Xyla and Xylon played with their planes, flying it and shouting at each other when one jumped into the other in the air. They could be so funny when they bicker, much like cat and mouse. Xyla did most of the talking while Xylon mostly scowled at her and said a few words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to intervene from time to time before they started pulling each other&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, Xylon&#39;s plane crashed a few feet from us. He hurried to get it but stopped when he noticed a pair of legs right in front of him. He trailed his eyes up and shifted back when he saw who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even I was tempted to run over and grab him when l saw Maddy standing in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so tiny in the jean shorts she wore that exposed her thighs, and the small crop top that bared her tummy. Her hair was styled in a single braid and rolled at the top. Coupled with her red lipstick, she looked like she was about to go somewhere, but I knew she wasn&#39;t. From what I heard,Maddy loved being on makeup all the time. The girl was crazy. I worried she&#39;d attack the kids or something, considering who they belonged to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crouched and picked up the toy plane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, this was it. She was definitely going to destroy it.I knew it. To my utter surprise, she held it out to Xylon. And worst of all, she wore a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s yours, right?&#34; She chirped, making her smile seem real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Xylon looked skeptical as he collected the plane from her. The kids must know who she was. But how? Had they seen her pictures or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to say thank you?&#34; She made a playful pout, crossing her arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Xylon said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. Don&#39;t be shy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t.... speak frequently,&#34; I chipped in. Her eyes darted to mine in surprise, then comprehension. When she looked back at Xylon, her smile was brighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s okay.&#34; She placed her hands over her knees as she leaned forward. &#34;I bet you don&#39;t know me. I&#39;m Maddy, and I&#39;m your aunt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We know you!&#34; Xyla uttered loudly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Mummy showed us your pictures and told us to stay away from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the love of the moon, these kids didn&#39;t have a filter in their mouths!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy&#39;s smile faltered as she straightened. &#34;Of course, she&#39;d say that. She&#39;s never liked me.And you know why she&#39;s never liked me? Because one day, I told her the truth, that she was a slut who was seeking attention from the wrong person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?! My eyes rounded in shock as I quickly reached for the kids. &#34;Slut.&#34; Xyla frowned. &#34;What&#39;s the meaning of slut?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was already on her before her crazy aunt could answer. &#34;Come on, darlings. Why don&#39;t you and Xylon go to the playground? I&#39;ll be there in a minute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t hesitate. They ran off with their toys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to keep them away from me?&#34; Maddy demanded, a scowl marking her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Maddy. What is wrong with you?&#34;crossed my arms. She looked genuinely clueless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean what is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not supposed to use those words on the kids!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared down at the floor, seeming to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I didn&#39;t know that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I still gave her my suspicious stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, that&#39;s my nephew and niece, okay? I haven&#39;t dealt with kids before. So, I had no idea I was supposed to filter my words or something. But what&#39;s the essence when they&#39;ll eventually get to know the meaning someday, though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. The girl was still crazy. She still thought like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy, I understand you hate Jaris. But do you think you can keep his kids out of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you saying?&#34; She took a step back. &#34;Hold on, do you think I want to hurt them? Is that the reason you pushed them away?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed, muttering some words under her breath.&#34;I&#39;m not evil, okay? I have an issue with their father,not them. Besides, they didn&#39;t ask to be born to him or something. It&#39;s Marta I blame in all of this. She knew who he was but went ahead to get pregnant.That girl is too desperate.&#34; She shook her head in disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh at how serious she was judging others. Well, I didn&#39;t want anything to do with her. So,I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I need your help.&#34; Her voice halted me.</p>
