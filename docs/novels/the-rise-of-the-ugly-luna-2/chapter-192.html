                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people mumbled as they made their way in,heading toward the stage. I was sure they didn&#39;t even know who the Executioners were, yet something about their presence was so strong that it gripped everyone&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the others made their way to the stage to meet with Jaris, two of them came to me after spotting me in the VIP section.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I still breathing? The fear that gripped me in this moment was bigger than anything I&#39;d experienced in a whole. What if they knew my secret already?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are they coming to you?&#34; Maddy asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the others on stage converse with Jaris.They looked at me and one of them tipped his head at one of them before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;d like you to come with us, ma&#39;am. Please.&#34; He told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What&#39;s going on?&#34; Maddy demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But they didn&#39;t give her an answer, neither could I say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gulping hard, I went after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken to an office where Jaris and the others were already waiting. Jaris was in an argument with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is unacceptable! You have no right to barge in here and interrupt an important function all because you have questions for my mate. I could throw you out this minute if I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shivers slithered down my spine when I heard the thing about questions. What questions did they have for me again?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re deeply sorry, King Jaris. But this needed to be treated as urgent. We wouldn&#39;t have done this if there was any other option,&#34; the grumpy man from the previous day who seemed like their leader said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole thing seemed like a movie before me. By the hunts, I wished this was all a dream and I was imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard multiple footsteps behind me as Luna Isolde and Maddy joined us. Even Marta was already here before | arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was quite full now with the Elders and Chairman. This wasn&#39;t the place to deal with the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their leader-Cole-turned to me. He might have the looks of a model, but he&#39;ll always look frightening to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you don&#39;t mind, Luna Lyric, but we have some important questions for you,&#34; he addressed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words got stuck in my throat. My eyes dropped to the floor as I struggled to take a calming breath. I didn&#39;t know why, but I had a very bad feeling about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Lyric?&#34; He called again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What questions?&#34; My voice was surprisingly calm when I spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has to do with the death of our colleague at the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall was dead silent, everyone&#39;s attention now on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve interrogated everyone that was there at the party. Most of them didn&#39;t see Lucy; others who spotted her as one of the guests didn&#39;t communicate with her. It turned out you were the only one that had spoken to her before her death. This brings us to the understanding that you might know more than you&#39;d told us.&#34; A flurry of running footsteps announced Jace&#39;s imminent arrival in the room. Jaris was already speaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this about, Cole? Are you accusing her of withholding information?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting harder to breathe by the second. Jace&#39;s eyes found mine, giving me a questioning look.I figured he must&#39;ve seen the truth in my eyes because his expression turned sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is precisely what I&#39;m saying, King Jaris,&#34; Cole said respectfully before turning to me again. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to mention this word before, but now, we&#39;d have to be more specific with the questions. Did my colleague mention the word &#39;Siphon&#39; to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My world came crumbling apart, fear eating me up piece by piece.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it. This was how I was going to die-in a disgraceful way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, I think you all need to chill out.&#34; Jace stepped forward. &#34;If you have a killer on the run, you should go out there and look for them rather than traumatizing the innocent ones here!&#34; His voice echoed with a raw edge, the kind that only came from barely restrained rage. One of the female Executioners turned to him. She reminded me a lot of the dead one. &#34;You&#39;re always being defensive.&#34; she said calmly, her voice as smooth and cold as steel. &#34;We did our research and got to know you two are friends. So, I guess both of you must share a lot of secrets. And judging from how you&#39;re always sensitive on this matter, I think it is safe to assume you&#39;re both hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s nostrils flared as his lips curled into a grimace.He looked ready to swing, fingers twitching as he fought the impulse. &#34;We have nothing to fucking hide!We just hate the fact that she gets disturbed all the time!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer the question.&#34; It was Cole, speaking to me again. &#34;Did my colleague mention that word to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach twisted. I bit the inside of my cheek to keep myself calm, tasting blood and fear. My hands,cold and clammy, curled tightly into fists. &#34;She did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my gaze. &#34;Did she suspect that you were one?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled as I stepped back. &#34;I&#39;m not doing this with you guys. I&#39;m not going to let myself be treated like a suspect. Go out there and find your killer. Leave me the hell alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I was thinking straight, I&#39;d realize that only a guilty person would overreact this way. It shouldn&#39;t be difficult to answer their question if I had nothing to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We really need your cooperation here, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just answer the damn question, girl?&#34;Luna Isolde chimed in. &#34;This is a serious topic. If you&#39;re being questioned, you should provide them with answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot formed in my stomach. Gods, no. I couldn&#39;t have my people turning on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did she suspect you were a Siphon?&#34; Cole repeated the question,his tone harsher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a sob forming low in my throat as I looked into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One word said in a firm tone. Yet, one that was enough to ruin my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A haunting light shimmered across Cole&#39;s eyes. It wvas the kind of look psychopaths usually have when they&#39;ve seen a new prey. A new victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t thik it was possible for a strong-faced man like Cole to smile, but his lips did crack the hint of one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lying,&#34; he told me.</p>
