                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised I emptied the entire plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want more?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gathered the plates to the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing back at the chains, my heart twinged with a subtle ache. I hated being in them. And right now, I&#39;d rather sleep comfortably on a bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t trust myself that much. I might be better now, but for how long? What if I end up hurting Lyric or Ericka?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Lyric. I&#39;d never forgive myself if something happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I had this confidence that I&#39;d be fine with her by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to the kitchen to find her washing the plates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you mind sleeping with me?&#34; Her hands paused with a plate in them as she looked at me in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, I&#39;d love to sleep on the bed but, I think I&#39;d feel better if you cuddled me,&#34; I clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; She dropped the plate in the sink. &#34;Um...sure. I&#39;d love to,Alpha...Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll take a bath first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a bath and wore something fresh-a shirt too.Lyric joined me just as I&#39;d finished dressing and talked about taking her bath as well in the guest room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I waited in the room, I imagined her under the shower, her hands touching her intimate parts while the water ran over her body. I imagined my hands replacing hers, touching her in places only I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, what I&#39;d do to have that in reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She soon entered, looking more vibrant. My/sparkled with delight when I noticed she was wearing my T-shirt and boxer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused at the door, looking a little shy and uncertain while my eyes traveled from her legs to her face. The boxer gave enough space for her thighs to be revealed. The shirt was too big on her, yet l&#39;d never seen anyone look better in a T-shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time someone was wearing a cloth of mine, and this feeling-it threatened to tear my heart apart with pride and this sense of ownership.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I found these in the drawers.&#34; Her nose was pink.&#34;I don&#39;t know if it belongs to you, but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Lyric.&#34; I held out my hand to her. &#34;Come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The need to touch her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she walked toward me, l imagined myself grabbing her by the waist and pinning her on the bed.I imagined her lips being parted in shock, then being claimed by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did she remember our kiss from two nights ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her hand in mine. Gently, I pulled her to the bed where she laid beside me, backing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She felt so small in my arms; so easy to spoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t understand what happened yet, but the room suddenly became too hot. My heart flipped the scripot,dancing to a frantic beat that had me breathless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kiss her. Claim her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voices wouldn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel how nervous she was in my arms. Yet, she didn&#39;t try to oppose me in any way. She&#39;d do this for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Lyric,&#34; I whispered softly against the top of her hair. &#34;I won&#39;t forget this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the longest sleep ever. I was shocked that Jaris and I had slept for six hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought at some point, we&#39;d have tossed and separated from each other on the bed, but to my surprise, we were still in each other&#39;s arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was still fast asleep, amusing me more than l could take. Looking into his face, I took the opportunity to admire him. He seemed so peaceful in his sleep. Handsome too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t believe he asked me to sleep beside him.The kind of joy it brought me...it wasn&#39;t even something I couldn&#39;t describe. I managed to slip away from the bed, delighted I didn&#39;t wake him up. I was so hungry and needed something to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was crazy I was this hungry when I&#39;d eaten something in the kitchen earlier that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my phone with me and tried calling Jace, but I couldn&#39;t reach him. I hoped he was alright and must have had some sort of information on Penelope by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d stored some food in the freezer, but when I tried to microwave it, I realized I didn&#39;t feel like eating that.I wanted something...salty. Which was kind of crazy &#39;cause I&#39;d never really liked salty meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have to make a new meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying to decide when Marta&#39;s call came in.Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>l ignored it. But she called three more times, making it unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I help you, Marta?&#34; I rolled my eyes as |answered the call, like she could see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; Her tone was icy, like always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...since when do I have to report my locations to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris has been missing, Lyric. And so have you. Now,I&#39;ve been having this funny feeling that you&#39;re somehow with him because you never mind your business. So, tell me; where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed. &#34;And you mean you&#39;re the one who&#39;s minding her business? By calling me to ask about a man who wants to be alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop playing games with me,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know where he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His kids are asking for him. I&#39;m sure if you had kids,you&#39;d have understood how worried they are right now about not seeing their father for days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That left me speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,if you&#39;re with the father of my kids right now, you better say something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, tucking some strands of hair behind my ear. &#34;I&#39;m afraid they can&#39;t see him right now.But I&#39;ll let him know about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about? What&#39;s wrong with him?&#34; &#34;Nothing. Please, don&#39;t call me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call and put the phone on silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped at the sound of his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning around, I found Jaris leaning against the doorframe, his hands in his pockets, oozing gentlemanly allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yeah.&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d been eavesdropping.&#34;She um...said the kids wanted to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of sadness crossed his face. &#34;You&#39;re right.I can&#39;t see them now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and nervously looked around. &#34;You&#39;re awake.Did you sleep well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You left.&#34; He said the words like I&#39;d done something wrong,which I couldn&#39;t quite understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hungry. I came to eat something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on me for sometime before he gave a clip nod and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed a little upset. What was wrong with him? I prepared noodles and was eating when Jace texted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You need to get down here right now. I just found Penelope.&#39;</p>
