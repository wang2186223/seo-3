                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously, I can&#39;t deal with this right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to leave, but as expected, he was faster and rushed to stand in my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I can&#39;t do this. I&#39;m not doing this with you,&#34; I said with irritation while avoiding his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really?&#34; He scoffed. &#34;Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a little harsh for someone you&#39;re still bonded to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a fierce, cutting stare. &#34;I am not bonded to you! Every connection we had ended the moment you rejected me as your mate, Roderick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so? I doubt the ribbon at the temple would agree, though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back, as if to properly admire me. &#34;Well,you look stunning, Lyric. I promise, if I had seen this part of you five years ago, I&#39;d have treated you better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms, hating that he had the privilege to evenlook at me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father has been trying to reach you. You&#39;ve been ignoring both of us, Roderick, and you know it&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know. And I&#39;m so sorry. But don&#39;t worry,Lyric, I&#39;m ready to meet your father. He and I need to talk about our remating ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, our what?&#34; My face crumpled like I&#39;d just tasted lime. &#34;I&#39;ve told you; you&#39;re more than delusional if you think I&#39;d ever get back with you.Even if you were the last male on earth, I&#39;d rather remain single till the end of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. Speaing about being single...&#34; he tsked. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t happen to slept with anyone while you were away,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest swelled with the emotions threatening to consume me.Memories of the nights he would come home with different women and make out with them in our matrimonial bed haunted me. He had been a true monster! He despised me so much he wouldn&#39;t even touch me for once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that little moment, I was tempted to tell him I had given my virginity to someone else on the very day he broke up with me. How lovely his reaction would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck you, Roderick.&#34; I turned to leave, but his hand grabbed mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go!&#34; I struggled with him, then suddenly,felt a new presence. A familiar one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat as I turned to find Jaris watching us, a glass of wine in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, no. No. Roderick and Jaris shouldn&#39;t be in the same sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; Roderick called with a small smile, releasing my hand. &#34;Please, go back to the party.There&#39;s nothing here you should bother yourself with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; face remained impassive. &#34;Are you sure?Because you seem to be troubling something that&#39;s of importance to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something? Hold on, was he referring to me as a tool?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick seemed surprised. His gaze slid between Jaris and I.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you... know her?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I more than know her. Actually, we&#39;re getting mated in a few days. So, I ask again, Roderick, is there something going on here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Roderick&#39;s jaw drop, and my stomach did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Roderick couldn&#39;t tell him we were still bonded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would totally ruin things for me. &#34;Are you being serious?&#34; He huffed.&#34;You...and Lyric are getting bonded?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned quickly to face Roderick, turning my back on Jaris as I whispered. &#34;Please, we&#39;ll finish this conversation some other time. For now, could you just leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Jaris demanded, coming closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick looked speechless. But above all, he looked angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I mouthed to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt I&#39;d already pissed Jaris off enough and news like this would really tip the scales. But thankfully, by some unexplainable miracle, Roderick listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are not done,&#34; he grumped before angrily walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep quiet breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is going on with you two? What aren&#39;t you done with?&#34; Jaris snapped, getting in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good Moon.NJow,I have to deal with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring into his face, all I could see was irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper, who exactly are you?&#34; His voice was colder than an Arctic breeze. &#34;Do you really have this much complications with men? Will I have issues with my Lunaalways found flirting with men?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; My voice was near a shout. By the moon, I hate it when he implies that I&#39;m loose. &#34;I promise you, it&#39;s not what you think. I&#39;m not like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, it hurt. It hurts to have to defend myself against such absurd accusations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about that? Because so far, I&#39;ve been dealing with the men in your life. Just three days ago,you were dancing almost naked in a club with men who you let romance you as they please. Then, you got followed by two men whose clear intentions were to force themselves on you. Yet, when I saved you, you were furious like I&#39;d interrupted something good.And now, today, I&#39;ve had to deal with-how many is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to scream. It was too much to take in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, first; I was never naked to the club. I didn&#39;t know I had to watch my dress sense since I was still very much single. Secondly, I&#39;m telling you, I have nothing with these men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, explain Roderick to me at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s... It&#39;s complicated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. Goodness, it was really complicated. He&#39;d get really mad if I told him I was still bonded to Roderick. It might be considered a breach of contract and I could get locked up for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What have I gotten myself into?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw drew tight. &#34;You disobeyed me today when you left my chauffeur hanging.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself not to roll my eyes. &#34;I told Kael over the phone.I wanted to go with my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t take lightly to disobedience, Lyric.&#34; He stepped toward me. &#34;And tonight, you&#39;ll understand how dire the consequences of your actions can be.Tonight, I&#39;ll punish you; make you feel hurt deep in the bones. Tonight, you&#39;ll learn never to disobey me.Ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips were dropped open in shock as I watched him speak. His eyes looked so threatening, and it didn&#39;t sound like they were empty threats. He was going to hurt me...tonight.</p>
