                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Her mother murmured. &#34;How&#39;s that-How&#39;s that possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They can&#39;t be his, Marta. We bought them,remember? Or did someone manipulate the results?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beatrix is Jaris&#39; aunt. She&#39;d definitely want to know if her nephew was being deceived, and if he was, she&#39;d expose it. She wouldn&#39;t cover up for us for any reason.&#34;Marta pulled at the roots of her hair. &#34;This isn&#39;t right.Something isn&#39;t right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; Her grandmother took a seat. &#34;Are you trying to say the kids we arranged for and bought in a far away country are actually Jaris&#39; kids? How in hell is that possible? Who&#39;s their mother,then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t know, grandma. But this can&#39;t begood.&#34;Marta&#39;s eyes were wide with panic. &#34;How did I end up with Jaris&#39; kids? How is another woman pregnant for him and...and he knows nothing about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More importantly, who&#39;s the mother of the twins?How could she possibly let go of them when they belonged to someone like Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find her.&#34; Marta pinched the bridge of her nose, frustrated. &#34;We need to understand what&#39;s going on. Grandma, we need to find the woman that sold the twins to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we&#39;ve all been trying to find Penelope for the past four days, right? There&#39;s still no sign of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But we need to find her so she can tell us who the mother of the children is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood in front of the window, fisting her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, to Lyric and Jace. She was going to make them pay. They almost ruined her life. If she hadn&#39;t been this lucky, Jaris would&#39;ve probably killed her by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was going to make them regret trying to ruin her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>KAEL</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael walked through the rows of cells. As he did, the people locked up stretched out their hands to him through the bars, teasing him to touch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind him were two maids, carrying trays of assorted foods and drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped in front of the cell he came for, where there was a guard guarding it. &#34;Open it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard was hesitant. &#34;Beta Kael, I&#39;d love to, but the Alpha specifically said no one should bring him food or water unless he permits it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For some reason, that seemed to infuriate Kael even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me ask again, Michai. Open the damn gate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what am I supposed to do when the Alpha finds out about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, who&#39;s going tell himn? You? &#39;Cause if you don&#39;t,then he&#39;s not going to know nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guard glanced at the maids behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They won&#39;t be saying a word, either. You have my word for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, the guard got the keys and opened the metal gate. Kael went in with the maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seated on the floor was Jace, head in his hand. Kael paused for a moment. He&#39;d never seen Jace look that way before. So frustrated. He must have overheard him talking with the guard, yet he didn&#39;t even try to lift his head as he made his way in.He wordlessly ordered the maids to drop the trays on the floor and leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace.&#34; He called when they were alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Jace looked up at him. He released a deep breath as he leaned his head against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here, grump? Come to mock me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and start eating,&#34; Kael&#39;s voice was serious.&#34;Have you had anything to eat since yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you now? My mum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me hit you in the head, Jace. I&#39;m being serious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hit me in the head and there&#39;ll be blood on this floor.And trust me, it won&#39;t be mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling his eyes, Kael sat on the floor, facing him. Jace gave him a surprised look. The floor was dirty and all.He didn&#39;t think Kael would go so low for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the trays of appetizing meals. Well, he was starving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; he mumbled before drawing them closer to himself. The first thing he grabbed was the pack of apple juice. It wasn&#39;t until he was halfway that he regarded Kael with amazement. &#34;Hold on, how did you know this was my favorite? Or is it mere coincidence?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go with mere coincidence.&#34; Kael tipped his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace scoffed and grabbed something else from the tray to eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, Jace? You sounded so sure that Marta was guilty of what you accused. How did you turn out to be the liar?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t know.&#34; He pinched the bridge of his nose. &#34;I don&#39;t-I don&#39;t understand any of this. I could swear on my life that Marta was never pregnant.Or...did she really have an immature birth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. Marta gave birth in the month of July. At the right time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see? Exactly!&#34; Jace opened his palms to him.&#34;So,when I met her in June, she was supposed to be pregnant. But she wasn&#39;t, man. I&#39;m telling you.Something-Something is wrong here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence blanketed them. Then, slowly, Jace continued eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you must think I&#39;m a clown,&#34; he mumbled,not looking at him.&#34;Go on. Call me names. Tell me I&#39;m a liar. I&#39;m a-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know if I wanted to do that, you wouldn&#39;t be the one to tell me.&#34; Kael flicked his gaze at him. &#34;As much as I know you&#39;re an asshole, I know you&#39;d never stoop so low. You must&#39;ve been sure before you made the accusation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace looked at him astonishment. &#34;So, you... believe me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, right now, we should be more concerned about getting you out. I&#39;m still trying to talk to Jaris.You know he&#39;s very pissed as he thinks you lied to him.But one way or the other, we&#39;ll get to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十十****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I angrily paced my office, my phone in my hand,listening to the beep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still won&#39;t pick up. The damn woman was ignoring my calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called her two more times and when I still didn&#39;t get a response, I went for my second plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called the second number, and after a few seconds,it was answered. &#34;Hello?&#34; The little girl&#39;s voice came on the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Jamie. How&#39;re you doing?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Who&#39;s calling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m trying to reach mummy. Is she with you? Can you give her the phone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated before shouting an&#34;Okay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Jamie, tell mummy that this uncle is going to take all your candies if she doesn&#39;t take the phone from you.&#34; She should know what that means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The child doesn&#39;t say anything in response, but soon after her, I heard her talking to her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He said he&#39;ll take all my candies away, mummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Margaret mutter some curse words before taking the phone, finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Alpha Jaris-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While I laid in bed, did you know the thoughts I had of you?&#34; I cut her off. My blood was flowing faster,my need to kill growing stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought of traveling all the way to burn down your house,Margaret. I also thought of just taking you out and hanging you on a cross. I wanted to watch you suffer. I wanted to do so many things to you, Margaret And trust me, I still will-if you don&#39;t tell me why the hell you&#39;ve been avoiding my calls, and why I haven&#39;t seen the pictures I asked for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; she was sobbing. Oh, to hell with her tears &#34;I&#39;m so-I&#39;m so sorry, Alpha Jaris. I just didn&#39;t know what to say to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you don&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He escaped!&#34; She let out at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was when I really saw it-red. Everything snapped.</p>
