                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My appetite left with Jace after our painful conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared, and a tiny voice in my head kept mocking me that I might not be alive for very long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard my door unlocking and snapped upright,waiting to see who&#39;d enter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hadn&#39;t been long since the maids brought me food.So,who was-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts took a pause. Swallowing hard, I rose to my feet as Jaris made his way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still wearing something corporate,which meant he must just be making his way home.But it was almost midnight. Why was he just coming back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s none of your business, Lyric.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening,&#34; I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time he was coming to see me since he locked me up. I couldn&#39;t believe he could be so cruel to do this to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed his eyes linger on the tray of my untouched meal. He didn&#39;t seem pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why haven&#39;t you eaten?&#34; He asked coldly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Just didn&#39;t have the appetite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously?&#34; He huffed. &#34;You&#39;re not eating so you can lie to people that I starved you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him with disbelief. &#34;I really don&#39;t get why you assume I&#39;m a liar.&#34; I have never lied to you!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing, but his expression didn&#39;t get any softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ambled toward the table, leaning against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He folded his brawny arms across his chest, and I forced myself not to look at how good it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why were you trying to run?&#34; His voice was less scolding, more like he was curious. &#34;Aside our contract,you were supposed to treat Xylon.I thought you liked the kids. Were you really going to abandon him just because of our differences?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. He really thought I was trying to flee because we were at loggerheads? Oh, he knew nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I scratched my hairline with the tip of my finger. &#34;I promise you, it&#39;s not what you think. I wasn&#39;t trying to flee because of our differences.&#34; I hated the fact that I was explaining myself and apologizing when few weeks ago, he had hurt me as well and didn&#39;t do anything to make me feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| know you might not believe it, but Xylon is the reason you caught me in the first place. And I intend to stay and finish my job on him.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;I can&#39;t abandon a soul like that. Never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he watched me with those accessing eyes of his. Those eyes that made me feel like I was being investigated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me where you were headed,then?I deserve to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. I&#39;ve had enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we just put this behind us?&#34; My voice was a little serious. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, okay? Sorry I tried to flee. Sorry you caught me. I promise, it&#39;ll never happen again.Honestly, I&#39;m just tired of this conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened. &#34;You think you have the right to be tired? I deserve an explanation, Lyric Harper!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, at least, I have and I&#39;ve apologized! You didn&#39;t do any of these on our mating night. You embarrassed me in front of friends and family! At least, I haven&#39;t done any of that to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved from the table, stepping towards me with eyes burning like hot coals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my warning to keep shut. My warning to tell me I was crossing the line. But I&#39;d been carrying this hurt with me for weeks!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a step back when he kept getting closer Eventually, I stood my ground, despite the fear clawing deep in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stood almost feet to feet, his dark eyes pinning mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know nothing, Lyric,&#34; his voice was like an ice cube. &#34;You know nothing of the embarrassment you brought to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? My voice was barely audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away, heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I did something, why don&#39;t you just tell me!?Because as far as I&#39;m concerned, I&#39;m the only one who has been your victim here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop. Didn&#39;t look at me. &#34;If you hated me this much, you shouldn&#39;t have brought the damn contract to me. My life is more hell than It&#39;s ever been!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, that was not true. But I was furious and not thinking straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked out the door, but I didn&#39;t hear the locks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a moment before going closer. What.I turned the knob, the door opened. And more to my surprise, the key was right there on the keyhole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t lock me in. Did that mean I was free?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JACE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace impatiently glanced at his time for what felt like the millionth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was one thing he hated, it was having to wait for anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked his phone and keys to leave when Kael finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, man! You&#39;re late!&#34; He hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael remained calm as he took his seat, facing Jace&#39;s. &#34;How ironic,&#34; the corner of his lips tilted up in a smile.&#34;A few days ago it was me begging to see you. Now,it&#39;s the other way around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must have vocabulary problems because I didn&#39;t fucking beg,&#34; Jace forced himself not to growl. &#34;Why were you so late? You were supposed to be here ten minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dude, I know you have the brain of a child and all,but there&#39;s something called traffic. Besides, you only waited for ten minutes. Don&#39;t act like a lady hasn&#39;t kept you waiting for longer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. People don&#39;t keep me waiting. It&#39;s forbidden in my rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael simply huffed as he reached for his half cup of wine and drank from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, why the fuck would you do that?&#34; Jace slammed his hands on the table, although it was light.&#34;Your stupid lips just kissed my glass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked his fingers toward a waitress, requesting for an extra glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re an ass. You should be thankful someone like me getsto kiss your glass. From the look of things,I don&#39;t think you get such privileges often.&#34; &#34;Yeah,you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael chuckled and emptied the drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was always unnerved by this guy. He could act very cold, his mind capable of delivering the greater evil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, why did you call for me?&#34; Kael asked as he dropped his empty glass on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waitress arrived with Jace&#39;s new glass which he started filling with the wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need your help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s obvious. You wouldn&#39;t call me here for any other reason.Please,refill my glass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace gave him the death glare. &#34;I&#39;m not your boy.You&#39;ve got hands. Do it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I fucking said please! How&#39;re you even the chairman&#39;s son? You&#39;re the complete opposite of what your father is. Seriously, I think I need to talk to him to change his son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you? Do you even have a father I can talk to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael chuckled, although Jace didn&#39;t miss the dark glint in his eyes. &#34;Look, you better fill that glass or I&#39;m out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace growled low in the throat. He wished he could punch this guy so hard he wouldn&#39;t heal. But he was right. He did need his help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grudgingly, he refilled his glass and slid it to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his gaze on Kael as he drank from it. &#34;Careful.I might&#39;ve poisoned it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you wouldn&#39;t dare.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael brought the wine to half before setting it down on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. So,what help are we talking about?&#34;</p>
