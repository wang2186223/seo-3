                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the patient&#39;s room with Guinevere.She had to wait around since the man was demanding for her and was called as soon as he was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Pete. How&#39;re you feeling?&#34; She asked with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man might have been sleeping for a long time,but he still looked dizzy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted his eyes to Guinevere. &#34;I asked for the woman that healed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did. And she&#39;s in front of you,&#34; Guinevere furrowed her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man gave Marta a long stare before shaking his head. &#34;She&#39;s not... She&#39;s not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chills spread through Marta&#39;s abdomen. This was the reason she had been reluctant to see him. But Guinevere kept insisting, saying their patient&#39;s satisfaction was important. And there wasn&#39;t much Marta could do to go against her superior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put up one of her best smiles as she addressed him again. &#34;Sir, I understand that you&#39;ve been in coma for a long time. You&#39;re probably confused and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I saw her. I know what she looks like. I need to see her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s countenance fell. It was a good thing Guinevere was standing behind her and couldn&#39;t see the soured expression on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Rete, a lot of people come and go in this room.Nurses had to come in every single day to check on you. You&#39;re probably mistaking one of them for this woman. You&#39;re my patient, and I&#39;m telling you, I was the one who brought you out of coma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the man shook his head, not convinced. He knew what the doctor looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was beautiful,&#34; he voiced out, his eyes staring distantly at the ceiling. &#34;Had green eyes, oval face,long hair.&#34; He sighed, his shoulders slumping.&#34;She was very beautiful. You&#39;re not her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s hands balled into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could he be referring to Lyric?&#34; Guinevere asked from behind, sending more fear to Marta&#39;s heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She could count the number of doctors that had those eyes, and judging from how beautiful the man claimed this person was, Guinevere could only think of Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t think so,&#34; Marta stuttered, turning to the woman. &#34;He&#39;s just very confused. I believe when he&#39;s rested enough, he&#39;ll see that he&#39;s mistaken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man shook his head, wanting to protest, but Marta put a hand on his shoulder. &#34;You should sleep now,Mr.Pete.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Guinevere spoke again, further complicating things for her. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll bring the doctor have in mind to you tomorrow. You&#39;ll tell me if she was the one or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;If you want to have more of that dream, take this.You have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I read the note over and over again, wanting to be sure I wasn&#39;t mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who left this in my room? How can anyone even have access to my lockedroom?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More importantly, how does anyone know about my dream?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced the room for minutes, digging my fingers into my hair, trying to make sense of the note.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one with Jaris. The one where I wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I&#39;d been craving for more since it happened. But this...this note didn&#39;t seem right. Did Jaris send it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, he didn&#39;t. Jaris didn&#39;t like me. He wouldn&#39;t want to have anything to do with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was this pill?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took it out of the small pack and observed it in my palm. I&#39;d never seen it before. What if it was something dangerous?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Jace could tell there was something wrong when he came to check up on me. He asked, but l couldn&#39;t tell him the truth I couldn&#39;t tell him l&#39;d been having sex dreams with Jaris, and now,someone just offered to help me keep having those dreams. I&#39;d planned on questioning the twins&#39; nanny today to know about their birth, but the pill had completely taken over my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even until midnight, I couldn&#39;t sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of the dresser, holding the pill in my hand.What kind of dream would I have if I took this?How different would it be from the one that happened the last time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how dangerous it was to take something strange given by someone unknown, I couldn&#39;t deny the fact that I was curious and wanted this. We might be at loggerheads in reality, but I wanted to feel more of him in my dream. I wanted him to kiss me.Wanted him to touch me more than he did the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I die being curious...well. I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the time.It was past midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My door was locked. Nobody could come into the room. And even if they do, at least, I&#39;d be able to see their face at last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was only going to enjoy the dream. That&#39;s it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I popped the pill into my mouth and swallowed with water.</p>
