                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished this guy didn&#39;t have this effect on me. Why do I seem to lose my composure when he was near me?I&#39;d feel hot and cold all of a sudden and start imagining him in my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a sad way to live, truly. Especially when I knew he could never be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; I lowered my eyes to the floor, my hand holding the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,staring at Jaris in the eyes was an extreme sport</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nodded. It wasn&#39;t even a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope your room was the exact way you left it?&#34; He sounded so calm, so different from the arrogant Jaris I experience most of the time. He reminded me of the Jaris I&#39;d experienced in the vacation home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yeah. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a short silence. &#34;What do you say about having dinner with me tomorrow?&#34; My eyes widened like saucers as I dragged them up to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted in shock, my tongue unable to form any words. Was Jaris Dreadmoor asking me to dinner?That was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you say, Lyric?&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the spark of amusement in his eyes. He must enjoy watching me struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I-&#34; My eyes darted around, unable to meet his face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with me? Stay calm, Lyric!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath froze as I looked at his face again. He fucking chuckled!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you mocking me, Mr. Dreadmoor?&#34; | crossed my arms, forcing a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time,he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, I could swear my heart stopped beating.Jaris&#39; laugh was always the cutest. It was always deep and dark and so rich enough to savor. I didn&#39;t miss the way his Adam&#39;s apple always bobbed when he did. It was so adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Dreadmoor?&#34; He repeated. Though, he&#39;d stopped laughing, but the mirth remained in his eyes. &#34;Did you seriously call me that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, but a smile slipped through in the end. &#34;You were mocking me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,tell me,doctor Lyric. What did you expect when you were stuttering over a mere invitation to dinner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I twisted my lips, wishing I could stop the color making its way to my cheeks. What was I saying? They&#39;d already been there from the second I opened the door to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well.. I&#39;d love to, but I&#39;m supposed to be at the hospital from four to nine p.m tomorrow. I think that&#39;s past dinner time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, like I&#39;d just said something meaningless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Worry about taking an extra dinner dress to work tomorrow. Your work time isn&#39;t an issue,&#34; he spoke with so much nonchalance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;You really have TCH wrapped around your little finger,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d be surprised what people are willing to do for someone like me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez.Such pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Like it doesn&#39;t send a swarm of butterflies dancing in your belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See you tomorrow at seven. Exactly seven. I&#39;ll be there to pick you up.&#34; He started walking away, then paused to glance back at me. &#34;I hate waiting, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept with a smile on my face. Don&#39;t blame me, l couldn&#39;t really help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I had free hours before my shift at TCH, I researched on something I&#39;d been desperate to do.l knew Jace would be furious at me if he learned I was still doing this. But I couldn&#39;t help it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I told him about it at lunch yesterday, I&#39;d already gotten the books from Botanical Bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I trusted myself. Once I&#39;ve learned to use my powers,I was only going to use it for my protection. And that&#39;d be once in a while. Or it might never even happen if danger doesn&#39;t come my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time for TCH, I got ready and left. Work at TCH was going smoothly. Marta was here,but fortunately, I didn&#39;t get to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my schedule, I had to inject four of my patients with Calmizol. It was a powerful wolf drug that was meant to bring them instant relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as they peacefully went to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I knew it, it was quarter to seven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly changed into the dinner dress I&#39;d brought along with me. I still couldn&#39;t believe I was having dinner with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to the staff Quarters where there was a mirror and applied light makeup on. I smiled at my reflection in the mirror. Well, I might look simple, butI definitely looked beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His text beeped into my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS:Where are you?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That butterfly thingy happened again. Geez</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fixed my bag and hurried out of the room. But of course, I had to meet one she-devil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the rude doctors-Kayla-was at the door and gawked at me &#34;Why are you this dressed up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t even stop to talk to her. This night was going just fine for me. Far be it from me to let anyone ruin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy to spot Jaris&#39; Zenith Glide among the numerous cars in front of TCH. I thought he&#39;d be in the backseat as usual with Kael and Nerion in front.But to my surprise, he was the one driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to suppress my smile as I settled in the front seat.I guess this was just about us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,&#34; I said as I fixed my seatbelt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Lyric. You look good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, to hell with suppressing my smiles. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
