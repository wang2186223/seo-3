                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect his next question. &#34;Did you meet her before the party by any chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on. What is this?&#34; Jace rasped. &#34;Why would she meet an Executioner before now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you let us do our job?&#34; One of the females snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, as long as you take that job elsewhere rather than bugging an ill lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, it&#39;s fine.&#34; I intervened. &#34;I&#39;ll just talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he kept up with this, we&#39;d really look suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned my gaze to the man. &#34;Yes. We met at a mall where I went to get gifts for the twins.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were as dark as night, no emotions in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you two talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;She told me I was beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She also asked me if I knew a certain lady. I told her I didn&#39;t and left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned the tab to his partner.&#34;And did you two talk at the party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took another dry gulp. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She followed me away from the party. I was actually shocked to see her. She told me.she was into girls and liked me which was the reason she approached me at the mall the previous day. But well, I wasn&#39;t into girls.  So, I ran away and left her there.&#34; I did run away. But it was her corpse I left her behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my stare as powerfully as gravity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I added something else. &#34;While we were talking though, I think someone was watching us. I heard the steps of someone running, but when I went to check I didn&#39;t find anyone. That was just before I left as well. It was the last time I saw the Executioner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think this person might&#39;ve been following your partner?&#34; Jaris asked. &#34;Maybe she&#39;s the Siphon, and when Lyric left, she went in and attacked?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tall man held my stare for a little longer before he sighed and looked away.&#34;So far, she&#39;s telling the truth. Are there any cameras where this happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sadly,no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;I guess we&#39;ll just question the others and see what they know. Our culprit is definitely close.&#34;He turned to me. &#34;Thank you for your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They went out the door, giving me the privilege to release the long breath I&#39;d been holding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t lie. All I did was tell half of the truth, and to them, it was still the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris, however, stayed behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you tell me you&#39;ve met this woman before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fumbled with the bedcover. &#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry. I just didn&#39;t want to make it seem weird that a dead woman had been hitting on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head.&#34;Take care. I&#39;ll check on you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he went out the door, I broke into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The week passed by in a blur and turned into two. I was completely fine and ready to get back to TCH the following day. My relationship with Jaris has gotten better. Both physically and in the dreams. We were more free with each other and even cracked jokes from time to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This side of him was exciting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night in my dream, he made love to me in a different way. He gave me the one thing I&#39;ve always fantasized about. He pleasured my clit with his tongue and I had the best kind of orgasm ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I woke up in the morning, I could still feel the impact of the dream. There was this constant sweetness in my lower belly and a kind of warmth it spread each time I remembered how good it felt. It was crazy how real these dreams always were. Yet I was sure that was aIl they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris might&#39;ve become friendly with me, but l was sure he wasn&#39;t sexually attracted to me. He wouldn&#39;t do the things he did to me in the dream in reality. No; I was sure he&#39;d never touch me that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hummed happily as I got ready for work. After three weeks, my suspension at TCH had finally been lifted.I knew it wouldn&#39;t be easy, but I was excited to be back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done. Come on,&#34; I said to Jace who had been sitting on the bed, reading the newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Woah. Who&#39;s this badass doctor?&#34; He dropped the paper and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had offered to be my personal bodyguard. It hadn&#39;t been easy convincing Jaris to let that happen. Let&#39;s just say he felt more secured knowing Jace and Kael had a thing. Besides, I think he was convinced that Jace was simply my best friend and nothing sexual could ever spark between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jace and I got outside, we found a brand new car parked next to mine. It had ribbons tied in front of it,like it was a present or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a white Titan Pulse and looked really classy. I wondered who owned it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was opening my front door when two guards stepped forward from around the new car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Luna. We were asked to deliver this to you.&#34; My brows furrowed as I stared at the car key in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand. You were asked by who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris.&#34; The second guard held out a card to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated before taking it from them. I didn&#39;t understand this. Jaris got me a car? How? He didn&#39;t have a reason to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like someone is about to drive a new car. AKA, me.&#34; Jace chuckled, already going to check out the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the card, I was stunned by the content.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;We had a deal at the party. Congrats.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched my brows as I laughed. What in Moon&#39;s name? He was referring to the game!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t believe this!&#34; I hurried to also check out the car. It was damn cool and must&#39;ve cost a fortune. How could he get me something this expensive for a stupid deal we made at a game?</p>
