                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite his efforts and involving some of the guards around the perimeter, they still weren&#39;t able to get Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was frightening to know he could easily penetrate the Pack without being noticed. How was any of us safe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was I safe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrenaline had been saving me while I was in that restroom with him. Now that I was finally out, I could feel the entire fear my brain had been trying to protect me from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monster who had tortured me for hours almost laid his hands on me today again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael drove us home while Jaris and I stayed in the backseat, his hand holding mine firmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re safe, Lyric. He&#39;s gone.&#34; He kept saying assuring words to me, probably because he could still see how shaken I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t utter a word. And when we got home and he led me to my room, a new fear settled in my guts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The things Caden had said about him. Did he mean them? Did Jaris really kill his ex? And did he make me wear rid lipstick &#39;cause it was her favorite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden made him look like a dangerous person, and I didn&#39;t even know what to think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to sleep in mine instead?&#34; Jaris asked when I sat on my bed, my arms wrapped around myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;I-I just want to be alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But do you need anything?&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There will be two guards stationed outside your window the entire night. You and I know you won&#39;t be needing them, they&#39;re just there to make you feel better. Will that make you feel better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded even if I barely understood what he said. My head was a mess and I just wanted him to leave already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a clip nod and exited the room. I could see he was also pissed and was only trying to keep calm around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he left, I rushed in and locked the door. I wasn&#39;t scared of him-hell no. But I just didn&#39;t want to be around anyone at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alone at last, I finally let the tears flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was all fucked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in my guts kept telling me the asshole might find a way to sneak into the Pack one day, but l just didn&#39;t want to believe he could get past the new security without being seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess I underestimated how slimy he could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After making sure Lyric was safe in her room, I drove out of the pack, driving around and hoping to miraculously run into him. I hoped that somehow, he was around somewhere.If I could lay my hands on him....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, after driving for hours, there was no luck. I tried to check for Lyric again only to discover she had locked her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t blame her, and I hated the asshole for traumatizing her this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a cold bath before retiring to bed. The sleep wasn&#39;t forthcoming, not when my mind wouldn&#39;t stop</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replaying different scenarios of what I could do to Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head started to ache, and eventually, the sleep did come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was pleasant at first, until it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a dream. One I was never supposed to have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One that only meant trouble whenever I had it back then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was feeding off of someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d split their wrist with my claw and was sucking from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the best meal I&#39;d had in years. Despite being a dream, the blood tasted real. Smelt reel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was juicy, and I could hear every sound I made while I sucked off of it. The person&#39;s pained moan was quite obvious too. Everything was heightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should stop. You&#39;re only supposed to take a sip and stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except | couldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when it was the best thing I&#39;d had and the best thing I&#39;d been trying so hard to bury. Why have I been running away from this? In what world was it right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until the victim dropped dead to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to a fog of pain swirling in my/ head, an aching throat, and my arms and legs feeling like they had run a marathon in the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing I did was reach out to the men to know if there had been any sign of Caden or his people.Unfortunately, there was no luck. It wasn&#39;t until I was brushing my teeth that the memory of the dream came to me, and I froze immediately,trying to recall all of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strangely enough, I could still feel the taste of blood on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t normal, and it bothered the hell out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fully dressed and ready for work, I stopped by Lyric&#39;s room. She opened up when I knocked, still wearing her pyjamas. She was on afternoon shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,yes.I knew her schedules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I leaned against the doorframe, my hands in my pocket. &#34;Slept well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yeah. Good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand was holding the door, her eyes barely meeting mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you feel better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause. &#34;I think I&#39;d assign a guard to assist Jace in keeping you company for the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woah. She didn&#39;t even try to object or anything. She must be damn scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should probably go. But | couldn&#39;t help noticing there was something wrong with her. She didn&#39;t look comfortable around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something you need to tell me,Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; She crossed her arms, her eyes dancing on the floor and unable to meet mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh...I just have a question, that&#39;s all.&#34; She looked nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, she met my gaze. &#34;Did you ask me to wear a red lipstick because it used to be Etta&#39;s favorite?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One where for a long time, I was speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing in the world could&#39;ve prepared me for the question Lyric threw at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood unblinking for some seconds, my head playing around scenarios.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,Caden.How could he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I squared my jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But was it her favorite?&#34; There was a slight tremor in her voice. She looked really hurt and betrayed. WVhat the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it was, then there&#39;s no way you can tell me you didn&#39;t miss it on her, hence the reason you liked it on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, stop this.&#34; My voice was harsher than l intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you kill her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the hunts, damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she the one Maddy had been talking about? She-She mentioned you killing a past lover. Goodness,she had been right all along. You did kill someone.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed her fingers into her hair, appearing so paranoid. The sight broke me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, we&#39;ll have this conversation some other time when you&#39;re calmer. I can&#39;t deal with this right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 tried walking away. &#34;Why don&#39;t you just tell me! Huh? Tell me the truth, Jaris. Did you kill your ex-lover? Is that what you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s &#39;Alpha Jaris!&#39;&#34; I growled at her, my eyes glowing red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice was thick and echoed through the space. It drew a deep shiver from her, her eyes round with fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I realized my mistake as soon as it was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used my Alpha voice on her, bringing my beast to the surface. It was the first time I was using it in years because I knew the effect it always had on people. I couldn&#39;t believe l just terrified Lyric with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a step back, her hand shaking slightly on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know the right words to say to her in that moment. So, I watched quietly as she retreated into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I should go inside,&#34; she mumbled before slamming the door shut.</p>
