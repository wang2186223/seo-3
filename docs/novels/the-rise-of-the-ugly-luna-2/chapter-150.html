                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute, no words were shared between us, our eyes doing thetalking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he gave in to the loss and leaned back in his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we should start talking, then.&#34; He locked his fingers behind his head. &#34;Before we proceed, however,I&#39;d love to know how the kids are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted in my chest, but I forced my expression to remain blank, my eyes not leaving his face even as he gave a stupid smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, my little niece and nephew. Never met them. But I&#39;d sure like to. Would you permit that, Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cocked my head to the side. &#34;Mention my kids one more time and this conversation is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;&#39;Fine. I want my position back.&#34; His tone got serious, but he sounded stupid all the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should know you&#39;re in my place, Jaris. If you didn&#39;t betray me and had me locked up, I&#39;d have been Alpha,and definitely the one competing for the grand throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward again. &#34;You sent me away to be imprisoned forever while you get the things I&#39;ve always wanted. In what worldis that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed as I leaned back in my seat, letting my eyes take him from up to down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Caden, do you really think you&#39;re fit to be King?&#34; I let a moment pass for the question to sink in.&#34;Because of you, Darkspire almost became isolated. Because you couldn&#39;t control your stupid urges and kept getting us into trouble. Our own people were already becoming scared of us. Do you honestly think they&#39;d have accepted someone like you to be their Alpha?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face scrunched in irritation. &#34;You&#39;re judging me now? You&#39;re judging me when-&#34; &#34;I know we&#39;re the same,&#34; I cut him off. &#34;But that&#39;s the point. You didn&#39;t see me going on a killing spree, did you? You were feeding on even our own people! And you dare think I betrayed you? If I wanted to betray you, I&#39;d have killed you. But I had you locked up instead, keeping everyone safe. And if I have to, I&#39;d do it again, Caden. So don&#39;t expect an apology from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes stayed on mine for a while, making me see the brewing rage in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m back. I want my position back. You need to step down, Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I couldn&#39;t hold back the laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t leave any position behind. It was shattered when you became a threat to the people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;I am telling you, Jaris. I&#39;ve spent the last year working on myself. I can control my urges now. I have been preparing for this! I&#39;m sure you must&#39;ve known by now that I was behind the King&#39;s death.I was clearing the path, and it definitely wasn&#39;t for you to take it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared harder at him when he mentioned King Thaddeus&#39; death.The asshole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Jaris; I have control of the Feeders, and they&#39;re willing to correlate with the wolves, but that can only happen if I&#39;m King. If I get what I want, tns Feeders will no longer be a threat. We&#39;ll all be one happy family.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was extreme sport holding back the laugh that wanted to burst through my throat. The asshole had so much delusions up his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need help. You&#39;re clearly sick,&#34; I told him honestly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew darker. &#34;You wouldn&#39;t want to know what I&#39;d do if my demands aren&#39;t met, Jaris. I&#39;ll get Lyric again, and this time, yesterday would feel like a massage to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightened, but.I didn&#39;t give him the asshole the satisfaction of knowing he was riling me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up instead, but he wasn&#39;t done talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, you should be grateful I didn&#39;t kill her. I mean, considering the fact that you killed Etta.&#34; My heart froze in place. It was impossible to hide my unsettling reaction this time, and Caden smiled,knowing he&#39;d gotten me right where he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was mine, yet you took her away from me. Not just her body, but her life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Etta was mine, not yours,&#34; I gritted, feeling the need to defend myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she? Or you just snatched her from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes as I pinched between my brows. &#34;I&#39;m not having this conversation with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fed on that poor girl until she ran dry,&#34; his words brought me to a stop. &#34;Talk about having control,&#34; he snickered. &#34;You were just like me, even worse. Do I need to list the people you killed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to face him, a hand in my pocket. &#34;I never denied being the same as you. I did horrible things,but that was before I learned to control my urges. But you? You never gave it a try. You didn&#39;t care about working on yourself. And that is why we&#39;re different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that so?&#34; He cocked his head. &#34;Are you sure you&#39;ve really learned to control your urges? We both know that Jaris without control is worse than any beast in the wild.If the people were to get a glimpse of the old you,the you you&#39;ve been trying so hard to bury, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d want a new King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled.tell me, brother; are you really sure you&#39;ve gotten rid of the urges? Are you sure they can&#39;t be triggered?&#34;</p>
