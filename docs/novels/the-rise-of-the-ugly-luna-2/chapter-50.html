                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a terrible hangover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head ached terribly. The first thing I did was soak myself into the Jacuzzi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I was a little calm that I recalled all that had happened the previous night. When I did, fury pulsed in my bloodstream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, he was there and ruined my night. Dragged me away when I was having the fun of my life.For the first time since I met him, I felt genuinely happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Done bathing, I checked my email and nearly screamed in excitement wvhen I found one from TCH,asking me to come over by ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the time. It was past nine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As fast as lightening, I fished for what to wear-black corporate pants with a red top-hastily brushed my hair, packed it into a ponytail and applied a red lipstick. Hm. The red lipstick looked really good on me today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my bag and file and hurried out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, some good news. I&#39;d be beyond grateful if I could get this job. At least, it&#39;d keep me busy and keep my mind off some depressing thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fished for my car keys in my bag as I hurried down the passage. I noticed someone coming before me-someone with a familiar scent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my head, I found &#39;him&#39; coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion was beside him, seemingly giving him a report.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat as our eyes locked. I had that familiar mix of hurt and confusion flood me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed too slow, but we didn&#39;t stop walking.And as we got close, I noticed his eyes linger on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows, wondering why the hell he was staring at my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dip my head to him as we walked past each other.There was a great sense of unease and loss as we lost eye contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Focus, Lyric. We have an important day ahead.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way to TCH, Jace called me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked the call and put it on speaker so my hands could focus on the steering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our usual greetings and teasing, he told me the reason he called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just texted you Alpha Zarek&#39;s number.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. What a relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks a lot, Jace.&#34; I smiled like he could see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish you&#39;d tell me what you need the number for.I&#39;m kind of worried, Ly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t be. Trust me, I&#39;m not doing anything that&#39;d get me in trouble. I&#39;m not you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffed. &#34;Of course. I&#39;m the one who gets into trouble because I&#39;m always taking care of your mess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. We talked some more before the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been hoping Zarek would be at the party last night.It was one of the reasons I was hell-bent on going. So,since he didn&#39;t show up, I asked Jace for his contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to ask him about that night. I didn&#39;t trust the fact that he had come into the garden, right after Marta left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone beeped with a new message, and when l got to a traffic stop, I checked it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hi, Lyric. Let me know as soon as you get back to Darkspire.I need your help.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? I arched my brows in surprise. Kael needing my help? What the hell was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I arrived at TCH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I showed one of the ladies at the reception my email,she showed me where to wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited alone for almost an hour before the woman from the other day who I suspected was Marta&#39;s superior, walked up to me. &#34;Good morning, ma&#39;am.&#34; I rose to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Mrs. Dreadmoor.&#34; She shook my hands. &#34;Sorry you had to wait for long. Please come with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed her into the elevator and onto a certain floor. She looked strict and always spoke in that stern,professional tone. Like the kind of woman that didn&#39;t take nonsense from anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught her name on the tag on her coat. Dr.Guinevere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we begin, you&#39;ll need to meet with someone.I tried not to make it happen, but he insisted. And with him,one could hardly say &#39;no&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her with surprise. Who was she referring to?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got to a door which she pushed open, and my heart nearly jumped out of my chest when I found Jaris in the office, leaning against the table, his legs crossed in front of him while he gave me that piercing look like he was the boss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be in ward four on this floor when you two are done. Just find me.&#34; The woman left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed rooted at the door for some seconds before dragging my legs in. What&#39;s he doing here? Here to ruin this tiny fragment of happiness I&#39;m trying to have?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word as I stood, waiting for him to do the talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, he did. &#34;Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to get to hear from strangers that my mate is applying to TCH?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned, not quite getting his point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When were you going to tell me that you had plans of working here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all I could do not to scoff and shrug instead.&#34;I didn&#39;t think it was mandatory for me to tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper, don&#39;t start with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, what? Why was he still addressing me by my father&#39;s name? He didn&#39;t like me bearing his name or what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should be informed if you&#39;re planning on working in a place like TCH. I shouldn&#39;t be getting to hear it from strangers.&#34; He grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sorry, but incase you haven&#39;t noticed, you and I haven&#39;t exactly been on talking terms. On our mating night, you specifically told me to stay as far away from you as possible. I&#39;m only doing that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed his jaw clench. He glanced up at the ceiling,as if contemplating a thought. But I could tell he was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do know I have the power to have you kicked out, don&#39;t you?&#34; My eyes widened in disbelief when he uttered those insane words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it. I knew he was here to ruin this little peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In case you had no idea, the woman that just left is my aunt-my father&#39;s sister. And the one at the top,the one everybody answers to-he&#39;s a member of Darkspire. You could say I have TCH wrapped around my finger.&#34;</p>
