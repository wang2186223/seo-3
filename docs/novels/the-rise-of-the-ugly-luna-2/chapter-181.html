                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw this coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The part of me that was afraid that this night couldn&#39;t go so smoothly without any problems.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if we beat Caden&#39;s last plan and he seemed to have been silent for some time, a part of me had still been worried that he&#39;d try to come up with something to ruin this night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went completely numb as the nanny tearfully told me how she was supposed to be waiting at their school for them but had to quickly go somewhere to do something else. And when she returned, the kids and the driver were gone. She thought they might&#39;ve come home somehow but there was still no sign of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think about the fact that the driver had clearly betrayed us and taken them away. The very thought that kept nagging at me was the fear of what Caden would do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, Jaris couldn&#39;t know about this. It&#39;d totally ruin his performance and make him fail the trial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-How long has this been?&#34; Iasked with a tremor in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A couple of hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And Caden still hadn&#39;t said a word about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was doing it again. Going into a panic mode at the thought of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should I do, Luna? The Alpha would kill me if he knows u left the kids when I shouldn&#39;t have. l-I just didn&#39;t expect something like this because It&#39;s never happened. Plus the driver was there. So, I thought they&#39;d be safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke into more tears. &#34;Maybe I should tell Alpha Jaris about it. We need to start looking for them anyway and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t.&#34; I held onto the vanity for support. &#34;He-He can&#39;t know.Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to leave. If only Caden would let him get through this night without the evil distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who I was kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang on the table with an unknown number  calling. Even though there was no name, my head already screamed the danger of who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too scared to pick the phone up until the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Lyric?&#34; Mrs. Bastina called behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone started ringing again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could you-&#34; A hard gulp. &#34;Could you excuse me,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although unsure, she left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands are on a shaky rollercoaster ride without an end in sight. I answered the call and took the phone to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finaly.&#34; The sound of his voice made me want to puke. &#34;I was beginning to think you wouldn&#39;t take my calls at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish I didn&#39;t have to-l wanted to tell him but the fear wouldn&#39;t let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| trust you&#39;re all doing fine at home? How&#39;re preparations going for the final trial?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know I hate it when I don&#39;t get answers, Lyric.&#34; His voice was tinged irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was enough to make my panic worse as l remembered the times he hit me when I failed to give him answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you take them?&#34; It was difficult keeping the tremor from my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you referring to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better be specific if you want answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kids!&#34; I raised my voice a notch. &#34;Do you have anything to do with their disappearance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... I think I might have an idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fell into a well of anxiety, echoing the emptiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, they&#39;re here. Wanna say hi to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh gods. He really took them. He wanted to ruin this trial for Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this? They&#39;re just kids! How can you be so shameless, and heartless and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Save the lecture for someone who actually cares.I just need one thing tonight, then I&#39;ll let them go.&#34; &#34;What?&#34; |snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes met the mirror and I realized I had been crying. The makeup I spent forty minutes doing was ruined because of this son of a bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come take their place,&#34; his response made my breath freeze.&#34;If you come to me, I&#39;ll let the kids go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never prayed so badly for something to be a dream.There was no way I was sacrificing myself to the monster. Just speaking with him was already filling me with so much fear. I couldn&#39;t imagine myself being in the same space with him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you say, Lyric? Should I let the kids go already? Or you&#39;re not willing to take their place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sick,&#34; I bobbed my head in a show of disillusionment like he could see me or it&#39;d even matter. &#34;I&#39;m not coming anywhere near you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still going to win in the end. If Jaris gets to know the kids are missing, it&#39;d make him lose focus.And if the kids are back and he gets to know I&#39;m missing, it might still distract him. Plus, what if Caden came up with a plan to trigger him or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, the asshole might just win this thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But far be it from me to let him win. Jaris had put in so much already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After killing the Executioner the other day, I swore never to use my powers on anyone again. But Caden was biting more than he could chew at this moment,and unfortunately for him, I wasn&#39;t ready to sit back and let him win over Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, despite how scared I was of him, I changed my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do I need to meet you?&#34;</p>
