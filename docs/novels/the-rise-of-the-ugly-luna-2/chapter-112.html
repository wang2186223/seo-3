                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dinner was beyond fine with Jaris. It wasn&#39;t the first time a guy had asked me to dinner, but it was the first time I was ever having dinner with someone. Well,other than Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I discussed light topics while we ate. I was surprised he actually knew how to hold a conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me more about yourself, Lyric,&#34; I suddenly said as I used my knife and fork on my steak. &#34;Like, what were you doing before you returned to Nyxvale?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone had told me months ago that Lyric and I would be having dinner in a fancy restaurant someday,I never would&#39;ve believed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But here I was, hopelessly enjoying her laughter and every single thing she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know what I was thinking when I asked her to this dinner last night. But well here we were.And if I had to, I wouldn&#39;t mind asking her all over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess I had Nerion to thank for this. All I had to do to get her home was swallow my pride and apologize. It wasn&#39;t so difficult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...&#34; her smile faltered. Didn&#39;t she want to discuss her past?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| actually worked as a doctor in Mystopia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mystopia. That was where my brother was imprisoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; I put some steak into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was a good experience. I didn&#39;t have a lot of things to worry about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound like you have a lot of things to worry about now,&#34; I huffed, drawing a small laugh from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found it cute that it was easy to make her laugh. And man,she had one of the cutest smiles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I do. If you think of it.&#34; She rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm.I&#39;d definitely have to do something about this eye -rolling. She was too used to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you were a doctor there until your father called you home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her next response came after a slight hesitation. &#34;N- Not really. I had problems at work and had to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed, my interest piqued. &#34;What kind of problems?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a deep breath. &#34;It&#39;s a long story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave her a long stare. I wish I could get it out of her though. It was crazy how I was getting fascinated by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That woman you chased after in traffic the other day,can you honestly tel me who she was?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease glimmered subtly in her eyes. For a moment,I thought she&#39;d actually get up and run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; she struggled for words, unconsciously playing with her cutlery. &#34;She&#39;s just someone I used to know.She um...she took something that belonged to me.Something important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was even more curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And...this thing isn&#39;t replaceable? It&#39;s so important you had to run after her in traffic and nearly lost your mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; Her voice rose a notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing her mistake, she sighed to calm herself. &#34;You don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s a long story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, I knew she was closing the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion had done all he could to get information on her, but it&#39;s been impossible. It was as if Lyric Harper never existed until few months ago. How was she shadowed in her family?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you always have that necklace on?&#34; | tipped my head toward the one on her neck. &#34;Remember that night I took it from you? I checked the pendant.It was filled with ash.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible to miss the new anxiety on her face</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But from what I know about you, Lyric,you haven&#39;t lost anyone important. So, who does it belong to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply didn&#39;t come swiftly. She chewed her lips for some time before getting something out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t real ash. I just-l just came across it and liked it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And you were so obsessed with it you had to wait outside my lodge for hours to get it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t say that to her. The lady was filled with too many secrets. It made me wonder if she could actually be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued eating with a calmer topic. Gradually,she got to ease up and her genuine smiles were back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the treat,&#34; she said with a smile as we walked back to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing. You can just pay me back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She chuckled. &#34;You didn&#39;t tell me I&#39;d be owing you a favour, Alpha Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing goes for nothing.&#34;I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking side by side, I stared down at her hands. I&#39;d missed holding them. The only times I got to was during the &#39;dreams.&#39; But she didn&#39;t take the pills last night. I didn&#39;t know why.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if she&#39;d react to me taking her hand in mine. Would it be too strange?Would she become dramatic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; My voice came out softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were by the car now, and as she stood face-to-face with me, I had a hard time concentrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was too damn beautiful. I&#39;dacknowledged that from the first day I saw her. But the stubborn me had always been bent on pushing her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something you need to know.&#34; I tucked my hands into my pockets and watched her brows rise in curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s a reason I suddenly grew cold at the mating ceremony. And why I always thought you slept around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was misled into believing you were that kind of a person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The furrow in her brow deepened. &#34;Misled? By who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went ahead to tell her. All about Zarek. The video,his confession.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I finished, she was so shocked her face could be used as an illustration for the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?!&#34; She panicked. &#34;This happened and I had no idea?! How could he? How could he do this to me,that son of a bitch?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the situation wasn&#39;t too serious, I probably would&#39;ve Laughed. Seeing Lyric this angry and swearing was a funny sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I judged you because I thought you consciously slept with him.l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I&#39;d never!&#34; She recoiled. &#34;I&#39;m not some cheap whore. I don&#39;t just go around-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; I took her hand. Fuck, I was finally touching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was under the disguise of trying to get her to calm down. She was clearly panicking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you. Right now, I just want to know how you were lured to the garden. Who lured you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows knitted together as she seemed to think about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated in her bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released her hand from mine to get it and appeared confused when she checked the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guinevere?&#34; She called as she placed the phone over her ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call wasn&#39;t on speaker, but I was close enough to hear Guinevere&#39;s panicked voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you, Lyric? Come here this instant! They&#39;re dead. All the patients are dead!&#34;</p>
