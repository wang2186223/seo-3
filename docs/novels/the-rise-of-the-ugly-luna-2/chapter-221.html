                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper,&#34; Cole called with a cold smile, leaning casually against the wall. &#34;How delighted we are to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to take a step back but couldn&#39;t. That would make them chase me; and I knew they were definitely going to catch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you we should check the house,&#34; a female said with a taunting smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, forgive me for doubting you, Niyahn. I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d be stupid enough to leave the man that saved her and come back here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed so hard I wondered if they heard me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so nervous, but I needed to say something.&#34;How did you find me?&#34; &#34;Wasn&#39;t too hard after we captured your best friend,&#34;Cole shrugged. &#34;He&#39;s one hell of a tough ass,though. The asshole wouldn&#39;t break despite the torture. So, we decided to look around the city where we found him. That was how we found you at the shop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another female took over from him. &#34;We already had our people working on some information on Jace.Fortunately, they found this house belonging to his grandmother, so we decided to check it out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands clenched into fists by my sides. I was right all along. They did take Jace. They hurt him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve left Jace out of this. I am the one you wanted! You didn&#39;t have any right to hurt him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole&#39;s eyes darkened. &#34;You&#39;re a forbidden thing on the run, Siphon. We had to do whatever it took to find you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill the Luna!&#34; I shouted in frustration. &#34;She was the one who killed my baby! Why won&#39;t anyone believe me?&#34; &#34;We don&#39;t care if you did it or not. We&#39;re just glad your kind finally gets thrown out of our world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They pulled out a chain from one of their bags. I took a step back, very much recognizing that chain. I couldn&#39;t let them wear it on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You set me up,&#34; I said in resignation. &#34;Didn&#39;t you?You wanted so badly to make the world hate me.And you succeeded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t I think of this? They must&#39;ve gotten someone-maybe a Siphon-to kill the Luna and pin it on me. It was all their plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole laughed. &#34;We might hate you, Siphon, but we never set people up. We knew it was only a matter of time before you did something that would reveal your true colors to the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed as his words confused me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough talking,&#34; the one with the chain said as he tugged,coming closer. &#34;Time to take you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could kill her here, you know? Tell everyone she</p>
                
                
                
                <p>attacked us,&#34; Another said, confirming the fear I had earlier on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole tsked. &#34;That&#39;s quite tempting. But I promised the King I&#39;d bring her back alive. She&#39;s lucky for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady frowned, like she didn&#39;t like the fact that that was the case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two of them approached me, wanting to put the chain over me. As soon as they got close, I attacked,grabbing both their wrists. I&#39;d be damned if I let them take me back so they could kill me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know how exactly/ I was going to Siphon all of these people here. Something told me it wasn&#39;t going to be possible. But I couldn&#39;t just stand here and do nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like I feared, they were too much for me to handle.I&#39;d barely been ableto fully Siphon the others when Cole and the rest came for me and knocked me out.I still tried to struggle, but it was futile and they soon had me pinned on the ground. The chains came on next, locking my hand behind my back. They weren&#39;t just regular chains. They were meant to weaken someone. And right now, they made me feel like I was losing consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This would be a really good time to kill you,you know?&#34; The female snarled above me. &#34;You really did attack us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t say a word in defense. I grunted as | was dragged out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept slipping in and out of consciousness. I knew we were in a moving vehicle. I didn&#39;t know which type of vehicle it was, or where we were even headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I badly wanted to ask them about Jace, to know if he was fine and if they&#39;d let him go. But my tongue was too heavy to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The journey lasted for sometime before something changed.My mind may have been weakened, but l knew the moment there was trouble. The vehicle screeched to a halt, followed by a cacophony of voices. I heard shots, growls and so many terrifying sounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was damn scared. Something was happening out there, and I was too weak to defend myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever was happening out there seemed to last for a really long time. The door to the booth where l was kept suddenly opened and the face of a man came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision was blurry, but he looked familiar. So so familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, there.&#34; His voice was familiar too. Was it Caden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me out of the booth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in a strange environment. A soft bed, well-scented room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly sat up, touching my forehead which  still ached terribly.Where was l?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The events of the past few hours came crashing down, and that was when I fully left the bed.Someone saved me. Please, don&#39;t tell me it was Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Going to the door, I tried to open it. Only to discover it was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anxiety shot to an entire new level.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I banged angrily, calling out for anyone. It didn&#39;t take long before the door opened, revealing a girl in jeans and a crop top. She stared down at me like l was being a nuisance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where am I? Who brought me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a gum in her mouth which she popped.&#34;Why don&#39;t you calm down for a minute? I&#39;ll goget him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed the door. I paced the room as I waited for whoever it was.When the door opened again, I snapped my head,and there he was. Like I suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Lyric,&#34; he said with his trademark sly grin.&#34;Looks like you rested well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed my hands on my thighs, my eyes down on the floor. Why did the wrong person keep saving me?I was grateful I was saved,but why him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t listen, do you?&#34; He said as he took a seat.&#34;I told you not to go back there. Can you imagine what would&#39;ve happened if I hadn&#39;t kept a tab on you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I resisted the urge to glare at him. I hated the fact that someone like Caden was rightabout something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t plan on staying. I only went to get my things,&#34; I said, my tone biting. &#34;Anyway, thanks. But I have to go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; He crossed his hands behind his head. &#34;And where exactly will you go?&#34; He gave a pause,but l wasn&#39;t able to say a word. &#34;I&#39;ve done my findings,Lyric. You don&#39;t have anyone else in the country.And I&#39;m damn sure you don&#39;t even have the resources to try to get out of the country. You seem kind of stuck to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I&#39;m stuck but I&#39;m ready to give it a try. And please, don&#39;t even try to talk about staying here.Even if you were the last option I had on earth to stay alive, I&#39;d gladly die, Caden.&#34;</p>
