                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know my way around the city Caden had brought me. So, I had to give Jaris the address of the store beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how far away it was from the Capital City. I waited for so long that I slept off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to a gentle tap on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fluttered open and surprise ripped me from within when I found Jaris kneeling on the floor beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He really did come!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or wait;what if I was hallucinating?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; I called with furrowed brows, trying to be sure he was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still dark, but I could make out his face clearly. He looked the same even as he wore a simple black jean and shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you on the floor?&#34; He asked with displeasure, his hands coming to cradle my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. Get up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to help me up, but the best I could do was sit with my back leaning against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, I can&#39;t stand,&#34; I told him weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this had nothing to do with hunger. It was simply the weight of everything crashing on me. The truth about my kids, knowing I&#39;d never be with Jaris... v &#34;Hey,&#34; I held his hand beside me. &#34;If there&#39;s anyone more fitting to be King, it&#39;s you, Jaris.&#34; &#34;You only say that because you know me. But I think we both know the truth that I&#39;m only a disaster. The people need someone better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head to hold my gaze. &#34;Let&#39;s go far from here. I want to stop caring about everything and just be...me. I want to live for me.&#34; He stared down at the place where our hands joined. &#34;Will you come with me,Lyric? Would you mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face bore a look of confused astonishment. &#34;You.... think I killed your mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression didn&#39;t shift. &#34;I just told you-l want to stop caring about everything. I want to leave everything behind and just move forward, Lyric. I&#39;m tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart bled from the reality I saw now. I&#39;d been so focused on running and had no idea Jaris had been facing so much-alone. I thought it was just my life that had been a mess. I had no idea he&#39;d been suffering too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen Jaris look this defeated before; not even when he wanted to opt out of the trials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave it a small peek-what it&#39;d be like going far away from here with him. The fact that he wanted to elope with me was something I cold not wrap my head around. He still loved me after everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked away from me, closing his eyes again with his head still leaning against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not been the same without you, Lyric,&#34; he spoke softly. &#34;I tried to hate you, to let it sink in that it was you who killed my mother. But everyday without you was a torture, and when you managed to escape, l hated you for running away from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched his Adam&#39;s apple bob as he gulped hard. &#34;You weren&#39;t there when I really needed you, Lyric.Nobody was. Everyone kept bringing complaints to me, demanding results and blaming me for the wrong things. Nobody cared to check on me like you would have. Nobody was there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears came running effortlessly. I released my hand from his as I buried my face in my palms, weeping profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; I whimpered. &#34;I hated myself for leaving you, Jaris. I just... I didn&#39;t want to die. He scoffed. &#34;You really think I&#39;d have stood by and let them kill you? I didn&#39;t know what judgement to pass on you, Lyric; but I definitely knew wwhich judgment I didn&#39;t want to pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words cleaved me open, inch by inch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I felt so terrible. Why did everything have to happen the way it did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; I sniffled. &#34;If I could turn back the hands of time, I&#39;d be more careful. Maybe... Maybe there was something  would&#39;ve done differently that would&#39;ve stopped things from happening the way they did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my hand again, running his thumb gently along my skin. &#34;I&#39;m sorry about the baby. I&#39;m sorry...I wasn&#39;t there to comfort you when it happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a frail smile. Right now, I couldn&#39;t help but believe the Moon must&#39;ve taken the poor child from me because it didn&#39;t deserve to be with a mother like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wonder what Jaris&#39; reaction would be if I told him right now that Xyla and Xylon were mine.Ours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish I could, but I knew the witch Marta. She was definitely going to expose Xyla and create an uncomfortable relationship between her and Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve missed you, Lyric,&#34; Jaris said as he slowly cupped my cheeks.&#34;Let&#39;s bury the past and live for the future. I&#39;m willing to do this with you.Are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focused on his lips which kept coming closer to mine. I went for it myself, kissing him passionately like he was the best thing I&#39;d tasted in weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kissed me back, his hand tangling in my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gods, I&#39;ve missed this. I&#39;ve missed him. My Jaris. The man who hurt me and also showed me the meaning of love. The first man to take my virginity and showed me what it meant to truly be in love. The world could be burning and Jaris would still be the only thing that mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We broke the kiss after what felt like an eternity. I locked my forehead with his, a smile on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I breathed. &#34;I&#39;m ready to live for the future, Jaris. As long as you&#39;re in it.&#34; I watched his eyes beam. His happiness was contagious and passed onto me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips parted to say something, but words never came out-only a grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face contorted in shock. There was an arrow in his neck. It happened so fast, I didn&#39;t notice it flying until it was already in his neck.</p>
