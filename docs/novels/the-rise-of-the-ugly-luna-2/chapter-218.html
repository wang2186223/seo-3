                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did she escape?&#34; I was tired of hearing Maddy ask the same question over again. Unfortunately, she didn&#39;t know when to stop. &#34;She was supposed to be sentenced yesterday. She couldn&#39;t have been able to escape without the help of someone powerful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched my brows, my elbows resting on my desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re barking at the wrong tree, Maddy. None of us know how she managed to escape. I&#39;m tired of this conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the brat wasn&#39;t done. &#34;Why haven&#39;t we been able to find her? It&#39;s been two days. The whole thing is looking like you not even putting any effort.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you&#39;re that concerned, you should be out there looking for her.&#34; She paced the office, her hands on her thighs. This was the reason I didn&#39;t want to speak to anyone before now. I was tired of people bringing up stupid conversations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you didn&#39;t help her escape?&#34; Maddy halted in front of my table and asked. &#34;I mean, I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised considering the fact that she&#39;s always had you wrapped around her finger. You loved that lady in a way that dlidn&#39;t make sense. You were ready to quit the throne for her, remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something cracked in my hand. I stared down and discovered I&#39;d snapped my pen. Maddy looked at me in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re getting on my nerves. Get out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blinked and the shock was gone. &#34;Why don&#39;t you just tell me the truth, Jaris? Did you choose that murderer over justice for our mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give her a response. It was pointless talking to someone like Maddy. &#34;Fine. Keep mute all you want. But I want you to know we&#39;re going to find her, and she&#39;ll be greatly punished for what she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She used to be your friend,&#34; my words made her stop.&#34;How did you just... turn against her in the blink of an eye?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t start with me, Jaris. I liked Lyric when we were good. But she killed my mother! Our mother! What was I supposed to do? Hug her and tell her she&#39;s loved?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her gaze but said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need her punished for what she did. I&#39;m not letting this go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door had barely gone shut for a minute when it opened again, revealing Nerion. He looked pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem, boss. There&#39;s been another fight between the ranks. This time, it&#39;s bigger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was all it took to snap the last shred of my control. I stood up with a growl, swiping things off the table to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It still wasn&#39;t enough. So, I picked up a vase and hurled it at the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I have been here for four days. So, far,we&#39;ve been surviving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He goes out to get us food and any other necessities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time and again, I&#39;d tried to get him to leave but he just wouldn&#39;t listen. I&#39;ve lived the last four days in fear of him being caught in my mess. The Moon knew I&#39;d never forgive myself if anything happened to Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t have something to keep my hands busy, I thought of Jaris. The one man that was irreplaceable in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had been able to get me scent suppressants so Jaris would never be able to smell me if we were close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d hurt me by not coming to see me at all while l was locked up, but I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to be mad at him. I still loved and missed him and wished none of these had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood by the window, thinking of him as I waited for Jace to arrive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared down at the phone in my hand, wondering for the umpteenth time what would happen if I gave him a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had managed to get my phone before we escaped. But it had been switched off since then as we didn&#39;t want anyone calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the past four days, I&#39;d asked myself what would happen if I actually gave Jaris a call?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recalled all the timnes he took care of me and made me laugh. I thought of our bitter memories-all the times we fought, wvhen he made me cry, the times l thought I hated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the sweet memories-the first time he kissed me, how he&#39;d act like he didn&#39;t care yet was ready to burn down the world for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nobody like Jaris Dreadmoor, and none could ever take his place in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, my mind drifted from Jaris to the fact that Jace had stayed out too late. He leftabout six hours ago to get more provisions. He should be back by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued waiting for hours. When the clock struck midnight and he was still not back, I knew something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned on my phone for the first time and called him, but his line was switched off.</p>
