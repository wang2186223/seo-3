                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work was extremely boring today. All I did was check patients&#39; vitals. Guinevere thought I still wasn&#39;t strong enough and didn&#39;t give me any complex work to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted at the end of my shift. All I wanted was a good shower and a long sleep. But when l reached home, Kael approached me just before I&#39;d open my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris wants you to accompany him to a meeting. It&#39;s in an hour.&#34; He told me after welcoming me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be possible. I just go back and I&#39;m -&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to tell him you&#39;d be exhausted, but he insisted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stormed off, heading to his office. But he wasn&#39;t there. I went to his room instead, my mind storming like a cyclone. He ushered me in when I knocked on his door. I didn&#39;t like the idea of being alone with him in his bedroom,but I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was rocking something on his table when i walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, Alpha.&#34; I was doing all I could to sound normal to keep the anger at bay just yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He merely glanced at me before looking away. &#34;I believe Kael has passed the information across?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! And I came to tell you that won&#39;t be possible.I just got back from the hospital, and I&#39;m beyond exhausted!&#34; You could be exhausted when you keep worrying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris sighed, his expression like one being pestered.&#34;I thought we had an understanding, Lyric. You&#39;re to accompany me to meetings and events. Or was l supposed to include &#39;without complaints&#39; in the contract?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about the way he spoke that always unnerved me. He had the uncanny ability to drop bombshells of annoyance, all while maintaining a serenity that would make Buddha proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger heightened. &#34;Well, the least you can do is inform me on time. I&#39;m not a robot, Alpha. I have feelings and I get tired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He continued with whatever it was he was doing on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence was frustrating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just take someone else?&#34; I moved my hands up and down in exhaustion. Afterall, you took Marta to the Rhys&#39; party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything, only grating on my nerves.I soon realized what his silence meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears stung at the corner of my eyes. &#34;This isn&#39;t fair.It&#39;s really not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stormed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than an hour, I was fully dressedand went downstairs to meet Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned out he wasn&#39;t down yet. So, I had to wait for him. How funny that I was always doing the waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed as I took a seat. I was irked at the absurdity of attending such a ludicrous meeting. If only I had a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, &#39;the arrogant king&#39; joined me.I rolled my eyes as I stood up and headed for the door. But | didn&#39;t miss the way his eyes lingered on my dress</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I was sure looking good in my ankle-length purple dress. My hair was flowing on my shoulders,and I had my red lipstick on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both got in the car. Kael drove while Nerion took the front passenger seat. And in no time, we hit the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept glaring out the window, feeling so mad that was sitting next to him right now and couldn&#39;t do anything. He was busy with his system and didn&#39;t seem to care about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We stopped at a traffic light, awaiting the pedestrians to cross over. Someone caught my attention;someone that made my heart stop in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in shock as the name escaped my lips.&#34;Penelope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right there, crossing over with the pedestrians.It looked like a dream to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For close to five years, I&#39;ve been looking for her.I&#39;ve been longing to know where my kids were buried. And now,she was right there! &#34;Penelope!&#34; I called again, louder this time, my hands on the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she couldn&#39;t hear me. The car was soundproofed and tinted black.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and the others must be looking at me right now like I&#39;d lost my mind. But I didn&#39;t care. Before I could stop myself, I opened the door and jumped out of the car.</p>
