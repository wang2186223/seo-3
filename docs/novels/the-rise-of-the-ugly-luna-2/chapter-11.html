                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men stared at me, like I&#39;d just told them the moon was made of cheese.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; The second man spoke for the first time. He was the grumpiest between the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I dropped my eyes. &#34;But I really don&#39;t want to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you telling us to deliver a message to Alpha Jaris? You expect us to tell him you refused to honor his request?&#34; The second man, asked, stepping closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I&#39;ll admit it. He was handsome-if &#34;handsome&#34;meant looking like you wrestled mountains for fun-but he was intimidating as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m sure she was clear enough,&#34; Jace spoke up before I could. &#34;Why don&#39;t you tell your Alpha to send chocolates or flowers next time? Girls love that stuff.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the men didn&#39;t look like they were there for jokes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re coming with us. This instant,&#34; the second man said in a tone that brooked no room for further argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t changing my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my shock, he grabbed my hand, though, to befair,his touch was surprisingly gentle for a guy who looked like he could crush boulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Get that hand off her!&#34; Jace shot up so fast he nearly knocked off his chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. I didn&#39;t like where this was headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you stay out of this, Mr.whoever-you-have? This is no business of yours.&#34; The second man grumped. He was too rude, unlike the first man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong. She&#39;s my best friend,SO it&#39;s my fucking business.&#34; &#34;Kael,&#34; the first man called, tapping his partner on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael. So, that was his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Kael didn&#39;t seem like he was done. Whoever he was, he had serious temper issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained focused on Jace. &#34;If you don&#39;t step back this instant, I&#39;ll make you regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happens if I step forward, then? Do l get a gift card?&#34; Jace took a step toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| stood up, trying to defuse the situation, but it wNas too late. Kael swung, landing a clean punch to Jace&#39;s jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And right there, the two men got engaged in a heated brawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They threw punches at each other, crashing over tables, breaking cups, flower vases and important items.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant turned into a full-room circus. It took the intervention of stronger men to be able to pull them apart. Kael&#39;s partner held him firmly when they were separated while I did same to Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving!&#34; Kael&#39;s partner angrily said, and it wasn&#39;t a suggestion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This isn&#39;t over!&#34; Kael spat out, wiping off blood from his lips with the back of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace wasn&#39;t in a better state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately,they left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; | turned quickly to Jace, holding his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Just tell me my nose is still cute. Is my nose still cute, Lyric?&#34; He looked genuinely worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez,it was difficult staying angry around Jace, even when you&#39;re aware that your situation just got fucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just finished an intense meeting with the elders and retired to my room to get changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found Marta in when I arrived, seated on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My spirits dampened. &#34;You don&#39;t get to come in here without my permission, Marta. I thought I&#39;d made that clear enough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she rose from the bed. &#34;I just had some good news to share and wanted to wait for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not asking what it was, I ambled to the table where l poured myself a glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you... curious to know what the good news is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell she was hurt from her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When were you going to tell me the truth?&#34; | asked instead, my back still turned to her. &#34;The truth that someone else had treated Xylon, not you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she said nothing, I turned around to see her looking pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh..,&#34; she cleared her throat. &#34;What&#39;re you talking about,Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always find out the truth. You of all people should know this, Marta.&#34; I pinned her with my gaze,taking in her nervousness. &#34;Were you so eager to take the glory and get commended by me? Does our son&#39;s health mean that little to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, no. It&#39;s-It&#39;s not whatyou think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you always want to be the best, Marta. But if there&#39;s someone out there who can help our son,shouldn&#39;t you be happy as the mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stuttered but formed no words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I emptied my drink down my throat and slammed the glass on the table. This was one of the many reasons I could never make her my Luna. She was too selfish.Even to her own children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; her pride was a hard pill to swallow. &#34;It was wrong of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a knock on the door. &#34;Leave,&#34; I dismissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught the hint of tears in her eyes before she exited the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her presence was quickly replaced by Kael and Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked like he&#39;d fought off some rogues himself.I didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me the mission was trash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She wouldn&#39;t come with us,&#34; Nerion supplied when l asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was numb for a moment, but when the words registered, it came off like a blow to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about?&#34; My brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, Alpha. We tried to talk to her. Kael even got into a fight with a friend of hers trying to bring her here.She said she&#39;s... no longer interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he was joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as seconds passed and no one laughed, I realized he was serious. My hand closed around my glass so tightly that it cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angrily, I threw it on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rejection. How dare she reject me? My whole life,I&#39;d never been rejected by anyone, ever. Who did she think she was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael, tell Astrid to cancel the rest of my schedule for today,&#34; I instructed. &#34;Nerion, get the cars ready.We&#39;re heading out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion appeared surprised. &#34;Where are we going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where do you think? Bennett&#39;s Pack.&#34;</p>
