                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept thinking about something else through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric had comprehensive knowledge in healing techniques. If she could heal Xylon, wouldn&#39;t she be able to heal me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, I&#39;d made up my mind and sent for her in my Pack&#39;s office. I was running late as I had an important meeting at the company. But this was more important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric looked a bit surprised as she walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you sleep well?&#34; I casually asked while scribbling down in my book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l uh...I did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good. Because you&#39;re about to hear some really shocking news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I called you here for a purpose. But first, you need to swear secrecy. What I&#39;m about to say to you cannot be heard outside this room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyebrows knitted together in intrigue. &#34;O...kay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Promise me it&#39;ll be confidential, Lyric. If word of this gets out, you&#39;ll hate what l&#39;ll do to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smidge of irritation crossed her face. She didn&#39;t like being threatened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph. Her business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I promise. It stays between us.&#34; She responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perfect. I dropped my pen and sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Since you seem to have a great knowledge on herbs and how to make people better, I figured you could provide some extra help. I have a problem that&#39;s been on for years. Like... a really long time.&#34; I interlocked my fingers. &#34;When I&#39;m in bed with a woman, I don&#39;t get to finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric gasped, her eyes reflectng her shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her. She probably didn&#39;t expect me to say those words to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to her legs, crimson crawling to her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think you can help?&#34; I shrugged, hoping she was over the shock by now. We needed to move forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh...&#34; I watched her gulp. &#34;I don&#39;t-I don&#39;t really...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. &#34;Can you form a sentence?&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers started fiddling with the fabric of her shirt. She couldn&#39;t look me in the eye anymore. Why was she so ashamed when I was the one with the condition?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t... really know. I&#39;ve never treated anyone with this condition before.&#34; She stuttered the entire sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you treated anyone with Nexopathy before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you were sure you could treat my son. So, why do you think you&#39;ll not be able to treat mine? Or are you being choosy,Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! It&#39;s-It&#39;s not that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Is it because it has to do with my dick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes widened like saucers as they snappily met mine. Her mouth was wide open like a theater curtain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen Lyric Harper so shocked before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly was her problem? Had she never heard those words before? I was sure she wasn&#39;t a virgin. &#34;Can you put a pause on the whole shock part and answer my question? Do you think you can treat me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed this to be done. I&#39;d missed what it felt like to reach climnax. I&#39;d missed that supreme feeling. The last time I got to enjoy it was five years ago, but unfortunately, mystery woman was nowhere to be found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I suppose,&#34; Lyric nervously cleared her throat. &#34;Um.... for how long have you been experiencing this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than fifteen years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;And... what led to it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts turned murky. Okay, you&#39;re crossing the line, Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How it came about is no business of yours. Just let me know if you can treat me or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed, shakily. She still couldn&#39;t hold my gaze for long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll...think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;You&#39;ll think about helping me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, not that. I mean, I&#39;ll have to think of the process and all. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get back to you this evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked really nervous now. Okay, she was hiding something. What&#39;re you hiding,Lyric Harper?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess we&#39;re done here,&#34; I stood up. &#34;Kael will be taking you shopping today for the ceremonial necessities. Remember, you have to be careful out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, then retrieved something from her back pocket. It was my black card.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made use of it yesterday. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed as I grabbed my jacket from the arm of the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask you to give it back. It&#39;s yours for now.&#34; I answered and I walked out first, knowing she&#39;d follow when she was done being stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be a joke. Although, a part of me had seen this coming. From the very day I told him I could treat his son. But finally hearing it from him sounded like a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might have an idea that could work for him, but that&#39;d require me touching him.... intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good Moon,the process was complex, and it definitely wasn&#39;t something I could do. Especially not with someone like him who had hurt me with that very &#39;thing&#39; in the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael informed me when it was time to go shopping. I was quite sadthat I didn&#39;t have a female friend that could go with me. I knew it was necessary to have someone I could argue styles and colors with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have asked Jace to come along, but since Kael was the one taking me, I figured it was a bad idea.I wasn&#39;t in the mood to witness another world war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the sales girls at the bridal shop we went through were quite friendly. They helped me make some decisions, and in the end, I got really pretty items, paying for them with Jaris&#39; black card. I was still surprised he let me have it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,the contract-privileges for a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the Pack, I started thinking of an alternative way I could help Jaris. There was no way l was touching his...man organ to treat him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made some research and drove out to Botanical Bliss to get some herbs I hoped would suffice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She waited in the corner of the garden, looking around and wondering where the hell he was. What was he taking him so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept glancing at her watch. She had a surgery in less than an hour. She needed to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he did come, walking casually like he didn&#39;t just keep her waiting for thirty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta,&#34; Alpha Zarek called as he took his seat. &#34;I must say I am quite surprised you asked me here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You kept me waiting. That is not so gentle of you.&#34; She tried and failed to hide the irritation in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I never said I was gentle. But I apologize.&#34; He reached for the glass of wine on her table, taking a sip.&#34;You said you could help me. What did you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta glanced around. There were the only ones in the garden. It was completely safe. &#34;I heard you&#39;re on a little bet with Alpha Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek rose his brow in surprise. &#34;How did you know this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My father was at the meeting. He overheard you two talking at the wine counter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek appeared thoughtful for a moment before he leaned back in his seat. &#34;So... how do you think you can help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well... what if I said I could you help you be the winner?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; Zarek chuckled. &#34;I know who your grandmother is, Marta. She&#39;s the great Priestess. So, I know you&#39;re in possession of some really strong potions and knowledge. But if there&#39;s one thing you should know about me, it&#39;s that I like playing fair. And I&#39;d like to win this fairly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rolled her eyes. &#34;I never said you weren&#39;t going to play fair. I was only offering some assistance.I could make the process of winning...faster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, Zarek was intrigued. &#34;So, what do you have for me?&#34;</p>
