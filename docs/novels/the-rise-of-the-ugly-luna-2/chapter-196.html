                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We took the stairs, and in no time, we reached a big bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her stall as she admired the place. Turning her around, I helped unzip her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whose room is this?&#34; She asked, running her eyes around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pleased she didn&#39;t ask about the fact that I was taking her clothes off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just a random guest room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I helped her step out the dress. She was left in just her bra top and under shorts. At least, she should feel more free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to rest,&#34; I told her as I pulled her with me to the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated a little. I knew she wanted to argue.Wanted to remind me that we had more things to worry about and that she wanted to get out of here.But she must damn tired &#39;cause she finally gave in and laid on the bed. I sat with my back against the headboard then placed her head on my thighs. She closed her eyes, taking a deep relaxing breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I revelled in the sight of her face. Her beautiful flawless face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes drew to her belly where one of her hands rested. I noticed she was mostly having a hand on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started massaging her scalp. The soft relieving breath she released was enough to make me want to do more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know why the Siphons became hated and banished?&#34; I asked a while later, still massaging her scalp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She mumbled something that meant no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Centuries ago, there were a lot of them. The people adored them back then as they were seen as saviors.The only healers that could help people in minutes.Things were going pretty fine, until the Siphons began to realize how powerful they were. The power suddenly intoxicated them, making them feel invincible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It got to a point they began to argue that leadership should be handed to them. They started Siphoning people to get what they want. They&#39;d siphon people&#39;s memories, their emotions. They&#39;d even end up killing some of them. They became a terror to the very people they&#39;d once been so sweet to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The King tried to make peace. And guess what they did?&#34; I paused for effect. Lyric&#39;s eyes had long gone open, gleaming with curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They pretended they&#39;d agreed to the peace. They apologized to the King and everyone and offered a handshake. And that was when it happened. They killed him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drained him of his oxygen. It happened so fast no one could save him. Right in front of his people,the Siphons were bold enough to kill him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could they do such a thing?!&#34; Lyric frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, recounting the story my father had told me. &#34;A group of Siphons are dangerously undefeatable. That was the first mistake the people made that they didn&#39;t realize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Siphons were determined to take over leadership.With the current King gone, they started assuming the position. But the people hated them. So, they had to act fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>certain group of people-brave warriors-came together and cooked up a plan to get rid of them That&#39;s... It&#39;s actually a long story for another day. But in a nutshell, they were able to defeat the Siphons and killed all of them-or so they thought. Unfortunately,the Siphons were special beings. Committing mass murder in that manner was something that should never happened. So, there were consequences, and the warriors bore the brunt of it. They began to develop a certain craving for blood. They started having this insane urge to feed on others, just to satisfy the new beast that was created in them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric sat up quickly, her eyes shinning with understanding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Feeders,&#34; she muttered. &#34;That is how they came about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. My brother and I are worst because our forefather bore more of the curse. He was a bestfriend to the king and was more furious at his passing. He was the one who came up with the plan that wiped the Siphons off. It was also him who did most of the killing. Believe me, the rest of the warriors barely assisted him. That mission had majorly belonged to Vorlantis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He bathed in their blood that night; spared no one-not even their infants. He hated them with a passion and wanted every single one of them wiped off the surface of the earth. He became a Hexed wolf.&#34; &#34;Oh, no,&#34; Lyric gasped, her hand rising to her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The curse ran in the family for generations and unfortunately became amplified when it got to mine.I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s worst between Caden and l.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes looked so sad as they stared into space, no doubt recounting the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t blame the people for hating your kind,Lyric,&#34; I calmly said, stroking her hair. &#34;They&#39;re known to be easily intoxicated by their power. A lot of them had seemed friendly in the past, but when the sudden change began, everyone was shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your kind can do things to people that nobody else can. They can strip people of their senses, emotions,identity... name it. To be honest,&#34; I took a deep breath,bringing her head to lie back on my thigh. &#34;I also hated the Siphons and liked the fact that they were in extinction.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we&#39;re the reason you became Hexed,&#34; she confirmed, despair seeping through her words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept stroking her hair, wondering how fate could be so cruel to make me cross paths with something I&#39;d always hated. Of all the women in the world, why did this special one have to be Lyric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called her special because now, I didn&#39;t know how to lose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; she said wearily. &#34;I understand that I&#39;m cursed. But I wish... I wish there was a way I could get rid of my powers and just be me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;Fate can be a bitch sometimes,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do?&#34; There was a small tremor in her voice. &#34;Everyone hates me. Tomorrow... tomorrow the Executioners would be-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll handle them,&#34; I interjected calmly, back to massaging her scalp. &#34;No one is hurting you, Lyric. You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know how on earth I&#39;d achieve that,but the Moon bear me witness that I&#39;d have to be dead before anything happened to Lyric and my child.</p>
