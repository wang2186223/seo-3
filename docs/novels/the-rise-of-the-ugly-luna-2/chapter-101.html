                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled as I tucked some strands of hair behind my ear,my face red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maid came up to me with the steaming cup of tea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.,&#34; I mumbled as I took it from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father walked up to me. &#34;Your room is ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded,taking a sip from my cup</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you mind telling me what happened? And for how long will you be here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d been worried since I came in crying. But I couldn&#39;t even bring myself to repeat all the treacherous things Jaris had said about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I sniffled. &#34;I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll be here for now. I just-l just want to sleep for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Does Jaris know you&#39;re here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, he won&#39;t be looking for me,&#34; I scoffed. But the words made me feel immense pain. He didn&#39;t care that his words had hurt me. He didn&#39;t care when I was leaving. He&#39;s never cared for me at all. How did I even let myself get entangled with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drank from my tea but had a hard time swallowing.Everything tasted bitter on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the cup and stood up. &#34;I&#39;ll just be in my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That night, I cried for a long time. Sleep was far from me,chased away by my pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;re that desperate for sex. aren&#39;t you? It isn&#39;t just me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded like he knew l&#39;d been lusting after him.I don&#39;t even know how that&#39;s possible, but he made me feel stupid about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;If you&#39;re so desperate for men, you fucking wait until we&#39;re done!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried harder, remembering all the cruel things he said to me. My whole life, I&#39;d never felt more ashamed.More ridiculed. There was no way I was getting over this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十十＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s still no trace of her,&#34; Nerion gave me the same report. The same disappointing one they&#39;d been giving me since last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and ambled to the window in my office,loosening the stupid tie around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the fuck is she?&#34; I mumbled under my breath.But I knew Nerion didn&#39;t have an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been twelve hours since she left the house. We&#39;ve checked every hotel in the city, but she wasn&#39;t in any of them. I even went as far as reaching Juan and Becky to know if she crashed with any of them since they were the only friends she had. But they didn&#39;t know anything about it either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked Kael to reach out to the asshole, Jace. But he was even furious and worried when he learned she was missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even this morning, I called the hospital to know if she showed up to work, but they told me she sent en email,requesting an emergency leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody knew where the hell she was, and it was getting on my nerves. Didn&#39;t she want to be found?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I&#39;ve had more time to think, I realized I needed to talk more with Zarek. There were some questioning statements about his revelation from last night. Like how was Lyric lured to the garden? She must&#39;ve been lured by someone she trusted, and I damn well know she didn&#39;t trust Zarek. So, who was it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe, Lyric could have an answer to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First things first, I needed to find her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I paced the room, a thought suddenly settled in mny mind. One I hadn&#39;t thought of before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Kael with furrowed brows. &#34;Contact her father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing interested me today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not going to the hospital. Nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just stayed indoors in my room, managing to eat when the servants brought my meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But later in the day, I decided to take a walk around the Pack,just to clear my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father&#39;s pack had a fine walkway where you had a row of beautiful flowers on each side. It was very relaxing, and when I was little, I used to spend most of my time running around there. As I walked down the beautiful path, I touched the necklace around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the last time Jaris seized it from me months ago,I&#39;d learned to be more careful with it. I mostly keep it in my bag and wear it on rare occasions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like now, when I know there&#39;s no sign of him, I have it on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve always enjoyed having it on me. The last connection I had with my twins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was wrong for saying having sex with Jaris was the worst mistake of my life. I hated him for everything he&#39;s done to me, but I don&#39;t regret having those kids.I only regret that they died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in my tracks when I heard Nora&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been so lost staring at the floor while walking that I didn&#39;t notice her in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My retort died in my throat when I noticed the state she was in. Her eye was swollen, her nose broken.There were other fading bruises on her face and neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to you?&#34; The question was out before | could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since they could still be seen, I could only assume they must&#39;ve happened this morning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, adjusting her sleeves to cover her wrists. &#34;It&#39;s none of your business. I asked what you were doing here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, did Roderick do this to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;d only make sense. They were mated. And if he did beat her up, it&#39;d explain why she was here at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you it&#39;s none of your business,&#34; she snapped,bout I was already going closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could spot the bruises on her wrists now. The ones she was trying so hard to cover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could he?&#34; I muttered under my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he do this to her? What did she even do to deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you kicked out of your pack?&#34; She chuckled.&#34;Is Jaris suddenly fed up with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart hurt from thinking about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nora, I think you should be more concerned about yourself. If Roderick has been hurting you-&#34; &#34;I thought I told you to leave it alone?! Why won&#39;t you mind your own business, Lyric?!&#34; She shouted at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was enough to bring me back to reality.Fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even deserve my sympathy, anyway.&#34;I stepped away from her. &#34;Afterall, you wanted so badly to take Roderick from me. How does it feel getting a taste of my medicine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks burned with both shame and rage. She Looked like she was about to say something to me,but we were both interrupted by a guard.</p>
