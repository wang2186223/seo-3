                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Several minutes passed. When I didn&#39;t hear a word from Jaris, I had to look at him to be sure he was even in the car with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was. He just looked... distant. Angry. What was he thinking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I sniffled, hoping to bring him back. I did because he looked at me.&#34;For helping with the board.Although,I remember telling you not to get involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a cold shrug. &#34;You still got suspended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For three weeks!&#34; I laughed. My voice was hoarse since I&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the window again and wiped my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to give it to those men who were patient and composed no matter the situation they found themselves. I mean, they could be going through shit and still speak calmly to the person that was pissing them off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been waiting for Marta for an hour now and already lost my mind. In addition, there was a broken vase on the floor to prove my impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my phone and tried not to crush it in my grasp as I called her again. Fortunately for her, she picked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris,I&#39;m-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not here in the next ten minutes, I promise you, it&#39;s going to get a lot more messy,&#34; I cut her off,my own voice vibrating with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was trying to say I&#39;m here already!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That calmed me down a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I dropped the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute later, she was entering into my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care that I pulled her from work. When I called an hour ago and told her to get here,she sensed how furious I was and tried to round things up and come as soon as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so scared as she made her way in. She should be. She deserved it. &#34;Jaris, I know Lyric can be convincing, but I promise you,I didn&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed. She actually thought this was about the hospital stuff? She didn&#39;t know it was way worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to control it. I promise you, I tried to put a rein on my emotion, but it didn&#39;t work. I was onto her before she could blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand wrapped around her throat as I shoved her back until her shoulder blades slammed against the wall. She tried to scream but it got stuck in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ja-ris!&#34; She struggled to pronounce my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so fucking pissed I couldn&#39;t think clearly.All I could see were images of Lyric kissing Zarek, begging him to touch her, being so hungry for his touch. And the whole time, Marta fucking Monroe was behind it.She wanted me to hate Lyric. I know she&#39;d always been a desperate bitch, but going that far? The asshole Zarek could&#39;ve fucked her if he wanted.He could&#39;ve had his way with my mate!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her face as she began to choke. She tried to get some words out, probably to try and beg me, but I didn&#39;t let her. I didn&#39;t want to hear what she had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?&#34; | gritted. &#34;How dare you take it this far?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t ask questions if she wanted to. I watched as her face started turning purple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You knew who Zarek was to me,&#34;Itightened my hold.&#34;You knew how much I hated him. Yet, you connived with him to sleep with Lyric. How fucking dare you,Marta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only when I saw her eyes rolling in that l released her. As much as I&#39;d love to choke the life out of her, I needed her conscious for the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dropped to the floor and coughed so hard, her hand holding her chest like it could help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her catch her breath for some seconds before l was on her again, yanking her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, please!&#34; She cried out, tears streaking down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you want me to stop, then you better start talking,Marta.Else,I swear by the sky, I&#39;ll kill you here and now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do that to Lyric?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...&#34; &#34;How could you fucking do it?!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her body wracked with sobs, tears flowing profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her go with a shove and paced the room, brushing my fingers into my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, I might really kill her if I didn&#39;t control myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent weeks hating Lyric for something Marta orchestrated. The poor girl didn&#39;t even know what she did wrong. She didn&#39;t even know why I was so cold toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did I ever end up with you?&#34; I shook my head,rubbing my thumbs against both sides of my temple.&#34;How did I ever get tangled with a bitch like you,Marta Monroe?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sobs grew heavier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I remembered. The witch had always been like a cat stalking a mouse in the shadows. We met in high school. She seemed like a pretty nice girl then.So, I kept her as a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,she made sure she was my friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when I flew out of the country to attend college,she made sure to follow me and ended up in the same school as me. She was a fucking pest I couldn&#39;t get rid of, and now here we were. I was stuck with her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, please don&#39;t say this,&#34; she whimpered like she was hurt by my words or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she knew I wanted her to be more than hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went closer, dropping to a crouch before her.&#34;Why did you do that to Lyric?&#34; My voice was calmer,like l was genuinely trying to understand her. &#34;How could you connive with my enemy to rape her? How could you be so shameless?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, she was ashamed right now. She couldn&#39;t even hold my gaze as she whimpered on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry. I-I didn&#39;t mean to.&#34; Another apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt that she didn&#39;t even try to deny it. So, it was true.She did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart broke at the painful reality that this very woman was the mother of my kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really want to apologize, don&#39;t you?&#34; I straightened and walked back to my table, picking up my phone.</p>
