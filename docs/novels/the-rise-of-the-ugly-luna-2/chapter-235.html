                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried as best as I could to mask my shock. In the name of the Moon, the guy had completely lost his mind!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A wave of uneasiness rippled through my guts as Jaris angled his head and locked eyes with me. There was no spark in his cold eyes as they regarded mine. It was so serious that when he finally said his next words,I was sure he meant them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. She holds no relevance to me either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes lowered to my laps where my nails idily played with each other under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden chuckled before leaning back in his seat. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll have one of the Alphas address you, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Jaxen coughed slightly. &#34;Actually, the reason we called for this meeting is because we&#39;re tired of the unnecessary bloodshed and violence. Gradually, our world has been divided into the high and low-ranks,and it is quite unfortunate that people like us are the ones who always suffer for it. For this, myself and the other low-ranking Alphas have decided to officially split. We are no longer interested in co-existing with people who see us as their minions. We are getting our freedom. We shall have separate lands, separate territories, separate facilities. Maybe a time would come when we&#39;ll be able to freely co-exist again. But for now,we demand the split.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Most of the high-ranking Alphas did not seem too shocked, as if they&#39;d seen this coming. Well, it was obvious with the territorial restrictions that bad been going on for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inclined my head, unable to accept the reality. I couldn&#39;t believe Caden had really succeeded in splitting the world. He said it, and the asshole was actually doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute after Jaxen finished, there was silence at the table. Jaris held his gaze as he regarded him with amusement in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you really think he will be fit to  be your King when this split happens?&#34; Jaris asked. He wasn&#39;t looking at Caden, but everyone knew he was the one being referred to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An even better King, Jaris,&#34; Caden answered with a smile. &#34;Trust me, you can&#39;t begin to imagine what I&#39;ve done for them already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A little more while of silence, then Jaris shrugged. &#34;If you want the split, I won&#39;t stop you. Afterall, it&#39;s your life and your decision. But you must knowthis-you&#39;ll not be allowed to step foot in any of our packs and territories.&#34; For some reason, he locked eyes with me as he made his next statement. &#34;If anyone is found trespassing, they may not leave with their lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath hitched in my throat as I quickly stared down at the floor. It was getting harder to hold his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure my people will not trespass. The Dregs will be sure to mind our business,&#34; Caden smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is ridiculous!&#34; An older Alpha said. &#34;We have been living together for centuries! How can we suddenly split now simply because of mere misunderstandings?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lives were lost, Luther! Believe me, it&#39;s more than a mere misunderstanding!&#34; Jaxen slammed his hand on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you&#39;re a coward, Jaxen, you know that?&#34; Another high-ranking Alpha said. &#34;You&#39;ll dare make alliance with our enemy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you leave the choice to us and focus on being Kings in your various Packs? We refused to be downgraded by our fellow Alphas.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, to hell with you! You low ranks have been nothing but peasants! Surely, we can do without lots of you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; Jaris commanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was hopeless. It was quite unfortunate that Jaris had plans of dissolving the ranks but never got the chance to before the issues started. Now, it was too late to do that. These Alphas were bent on leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris continued. &#34;I have accepted your plea. If this is what every one of you wants, then you shall have the split. I&#39;ll draft the territories and restrictions and send it over when I&#39;m done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you should be the only one to do that,&#34; Caden objected. &#34;Aren&#39;t we all supposed to sit and mark the territories ourselves?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m the only onethat&#39;s King, Caden, and the only one that&#39;ll make these decisions. You&#39;ll only be a dictator to these people, never a King. And one day-which I&#39;m very sure of-they&#39;ll realize how big of a mistake they&#39;ve made, and unfortunately, it&#39;ll be too late for them to come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. You sound so sure they&#39;ll be regretting this. What makes you think the Alphas with you won&#39;t regret in the future?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris shrugged. &#34;Why don&#39;t we see how that plays out, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, they both held their stares, not uttering a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; Caden sighed. &#34;Since the splitting has been accepted, I&#39;ll let it known that no one from your Pack is permitted to touch anyone from mine. To be more specific,&#34; he leaned forward. &#34;I&#39;m referring to my Lady-Lyric. Your people would&#39;ve killed her had I not saved her in time. Henceforth, she&#39;s a property of the Dregs,and as such, you do not have the right to lay a hand on her. Not anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; eyes were stone-cold. He kept it calm like he didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As long as your Lady doesn&#39;t trespass on my territory, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be fine.&#34; He didn&#39;t even look at me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah. Don&#39;t worry; there&#39;s nothing of importance in your Pack that&#39;d bring her over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about that? Are you... certain she doesn&#39;t have a litter boyfriend around there? If I remember correctly, she loves the attention of men a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted in shock, my eyes unblinking as they looked at him; though he wasn&#39;t even looking at me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden&#39;s smile vanished for some seconds before he brought it right back. &#34;Or maybe she&#39;s just a really loveable lady who attracts a lot of men. You know, we men love good things, and we tend to want to worship people like her. It&#39;ll be a shame for any man to lose her, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah,&#34; Jaris tsked. &#34;Only a man who hasn&#39;t been with her for a long time will say such nonsense. Being with your Lady is boring. The only time something happens is when she does something bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t breathe anymore. Sitting here and being the center of their rants made me want to lose my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on my feet before I could stop myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I need to use the restroom.&#34; I hurried off immediately, not looking at anyone else&#39;s faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heels clicked against the floor as I trotted until I found the restroom. As soon as I made my way in,I shut the door with full force and leaned my back against it. The tears finally came flowing. This time, I didn&#39;t care about the stupid makeup or how mad Caden would be about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was falling apart. It all felt like one stupid bad dream I was never going to wake from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods,I was tired. So so tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slid to the floor and wept for a long time. I knew this was going to happen when I siphoned our happy memories. If Jaris didn&#39;t have a reason to like me, of course, he was bound to hate me. I guess I just didn&#39;t prepare myself to be hated by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone vibrated in my purse. I took it out and found a text from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get over here. Right now!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled as I forced myself to my feet. The last thing I wanted was for Caden to burst into this restroom himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My makeup was already ruined with pathways of tears. Fuck, this was definitely going to get him super mad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleaned the tears I could as well as some makeup. I didn&#39;t lookas perfect as I&#39;d come, and anyone would easily be able to tell I&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I opened the door to leave, I found Kael waiting outside the men&#39;s room, his hands tucked in his pockets as he leaned against the doorframe. I slowly stepped out of the lady&#39;s room and closed the door behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; he eased away from the door. He scrutinized me carefully. &#34;How have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh at the question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled as I lowered my gaze. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; The lie tasted bitter on mny tongue. Even I didn&#39;t know what it felt like to be fine anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from him, attempting to walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,Lyric,for doing this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came to a stop, though I didn&#39;t turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s hard. I know Caden is a monster and must not have been good to you. I know... it&#39;s hard having Jaris hate you like this when you&#39;re only in this position &#39;cause you saved his life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears returned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know it&#39;s hard that no one knows the sacrifice you made. I want you to know I&#39;m deeply sorry, Lyric. So sorry you&#39;re in this situation. I hope...you find a way to get out soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobs broke free from my throat as more tears continued to flow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, it felt good. Felt good to know that someone understood what I was passing through. I couldn&#39;t even blame him for pushing me to Caden. If I hadn&#39;t gone to Caden, Jaris would&#39;ve still been missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dabbing my tears, I forced myself to stop crying and walked away, unable to utter any word to Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my life now-the one I choose over my dreams with Jaris. The one I choose over my freedom.The one I choose because I fell hard in love.</p>
