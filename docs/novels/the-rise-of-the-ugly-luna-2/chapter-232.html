                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even turn to glance at him but kept my eyes on Jaris as I thought of what I was about to do with his memories. I was sure there would be no mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we waited for the moon to come out, Caden had gotten me to experiment on three of his prisoners-crazy that he was already beginning to have prisoners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My powers did precisely what I wanted them to do without killing the men-unlike when I&#39;d killed that Executioner by accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As soon as I give him the antidote, he&#39;ll be weak. That is when you Siphon him. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this necessary?&#34; I glanced at him with teary eyes. &#34;We could just... let him go and I&#39;ll stay away from him like the contract says. We don&#39;t have to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I know my brother. He&#39;s never going to stop fighting for you even if you try to avoid him. He needs a good reason to stay away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To hate me, you mean!&#34; I snapped at him. But he simply shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call it what you want. Now, do I give him the antidote or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bite down on my lower lip to stop it from shaking. Gods, I hated him so much. I hated the son of a bitch and hope he suffers at the end of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, I moved away from Jaris. &#34;Get him up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden whistled, calling one of his men who came in with the antidote in a very small bottle. I watched with curious eyes as he lowered to Jaris&#39; side to inject the antidote in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get that antidote?&#34; I suddenly asked. &#34;I mean, my powers wouldn&#39;t even work on him since he was poisoned with my blood. So, what antidote is strong enough to work on him?&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t bore yourself with the details, Lyric,&#34; he answered coldly without looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t say anything else as Jaris suddenly gasped awake. Every other thought flew out the window as my entire focus was on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was awake! Caden was right when he said he&#39;d wake him up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, at some point, I&#39;d been scared the son of a bitch wouldn&#39;t keep to the end of his bargain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, Lyric! Do it!&#34; Caden ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like he said, Jaris looked weak and didn&#39;t even have his eyes opened yet. I wasn&#39;t sure he knew what was happening around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet felt like jelly as I went to sit on the edge of the bed beside him. His handsome face soon blurred in my vision due to the tears that had gotten worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric. Stop stalling and do what I fucking asked,&#34; Caden snapped, his patience clearly growing thin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have a choice. There was a contract binding us. I had to do his bidding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Jaris&#39; hand in mine, I dug my nails into the flesh of his wrist and began the process. Tears streaked as I ran through the memories in my head-the memories I wanted gone from his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I erased all our good times-the first day we met at that bar and he called me Princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That magical night where he touched my body for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first day he kissed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the little moments that seemed like nothing but deep down, we knew our hearts were synching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our first sex in Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the times I was there for him when he was at his lowest. The times he made crazy decisions for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully and painfully, I stripped Jaris off his feelings for me. I siphoned the emotions that made me special in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop until I was sure he was left with nothing and the name Lyric would never mean anything to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was going to remember me, but only as a random girl he never should&#39;ve met. The Siphon who killed his mother and managed to get away with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our future was gone. As was our past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shaking like a leaf by the time I finished and removed my nails from him. His eyes were still closed, and this time, it looked like he had gone to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears had shaped a sorrowful necklace, tracing the line of my neck. My heart ached terribly. Not just literally but physically-like a sharp pain carefully hurting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair as I stood up, sobbing like a child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s done. It&#39;s over,&#34; I told Caden before I ran out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up in the middle of the night in a strange environment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been lying on a bench, and there was no recollection of how I got here. This was definitely not the Capital City.How did I get here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, confused. Something felt wrong within me. Like there was something greatly missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thing I remembered was getting an arrow in my throat. I touched my neck, but the mark was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who shot me? And for how long was I passed out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three cars suddenly pulled up in front of me. Men ran out of themn, including Kael and Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris!&#34; &#34;Boss!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all called as they ran toward me, every one of them seeming worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Kael asked as be sat beside me, placing a hand on my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a surprised stare. &#34;I feel okay. How did I get here? And...how did you know you&#39;d find me here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Caden,&#34; Nerion&#39;s face hardened. &#34;He had you taken for two weeks and just sent us this location to pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? &#34;Two weeks!? It doesn&#39;t feel like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had youpoisoned. So you stayed asleep the entire time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, unable to believe the son of a bitch got me this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did he suddenly release me? What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think we should be having this conversation here, My King.&#34; It was Kael who answered. &#34;We should get going. We can fill you in in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted and didn&#39;t argue with them. I followed them to the car, but the whole time, I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that something was missing. Something I wished I didn&#39;t have to let go of but it was necessary to.</p>
