                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath froze in my lungs as I stared wide-eyed at the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I wasn&#39;t mistaken. It was very clear to me now.That was Penelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Do you know her?&#34; Jace asked in surprise,his eyes darting between me and the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could hardly even hear him. Before I knew it, I was moving toward the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Lyric!&#34; Jace caught up with me, holding my wrist.&#34;Calm down now will you? What&#39;s going on? Did she offend you or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! l-&#34; | closed my eyes and took a deep breath.I was trying so hard to think straight. It was hard to do that when I was reminded of the kids | lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need to talk to her. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fred my hand from his and continued toward the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve been looking for her for five years. One might say it&#39;s been a long time and thne kids were already dead,but I didn&#39;t care. I needed to know where my babies were buried. I deserved that as their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope had been a nice woman. She took me off the streets, gave me a place to sleep and fed me Although, I didn&#39;t understand why she suddenly went missing after I put to bed. But she had been a nice person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope,&#34; I called when I reached the group. She was laughing about something Jace&#39;s mother had just said, and the moment they saw me, their conversation died down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, darling. Is there a problem?&#34; Jace&#39;s mother asked sweetly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t even look at her as I kept my gaze pinned on Penelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked better than she was five years ago.Prettier,hotter. She was holding hands with a man l assumed must bethe Elder. He looked way older than her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must have gotten married to him of recent,because when I met her, she told me she wasn&#39;t married.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to speak to you.&#34; It was all I could to keep my voice even. She didn&#39;t seem shocked. Then it dawned on me. She clearly didn&#39;t know who I was. She only knew me as the ugly girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...who are you? And why would you want to see me?&#34; She asked politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s my friend.&#34; Jace settled beside me. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, she doesn&#39;t have any evil intentions. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just...curious about something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. I wouldn&#39;t know what to do if she refused to speak to me. The last thing I wanted was to break down in front of all these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; She nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed me to the garden which was very secluded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what is this about?&#34; She raised her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I was out of words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For five years, I&#39;d tried and failed to get over the death of the kids. Seeing Penelope now didn&#39;t make it any better. Instead, I had to feel the pain all over-my panic when I didn&#39;t hear my babies cry after I put to bed. I remember asking the doctor what was wrong.I was in so much pain I couldn&#39;t stay awake, and when l woke up, they told me I had a stillbirth and Penelope had taken them to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remember going to her house but she never came.At a point, I was even worried that something bad might have happened to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you bury them?&#34; The question came out without proper thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She furrowed her brows, clearly confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crying?&#34; She asked with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled and touched my cheek. Damn my inability to hold back tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Lyric.&#34; Another sniffle. &#34;The scarred pregnant girl.Do you remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it registered. She must know who I was by now because the shock that crept into her face was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ly-Ly-Lyric?&#34; She stuttered my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled again as I nodded. &#34;You remember me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a head to toe stare, her mouth wide agape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell,&#34; she muttered. &#34;You look...&#34; she shook her head. &#34;How am I sure this is you?&#34; &#34;24th Maple Street?&#34; I raised my brows, stating her address.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still remembered it. It was the third place I&#39;d gone to when I returned to the country. I was disappointed to find a new tenant there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the hunts!&#34; She covered her mouth with her palm.&#34;It&#39;s really you! How&#39;s this possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long story. I&#39;ve been looking for you, for a very long time. What happened? I never saw you again after the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I-&#34; she cleared her throat, her eyes blinking rapidly. &#34;I-I got into some sort of trouble. It came urgently and I didn&#39;t want to drag you into the mess with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t doubt her. When I lived with Penelope, she always seemed like she was into some sort of shady lifestyle. She kept telling me she had enemies and all.But she was good to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she ran from the hospital because she wanted to protect me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you bury the babies?&#34; It was sodifficult asking this very question, and I hated that I had to repeat it. I didn&#39;t even get to hold them in my arms. I didn&#39;t get to hear them cry. If only... If only they&#39;d just let me hear the sound of their voice before they passed on.If only they&#39;d given me the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; Penelope said in a very soft voice.I realized it was because I&#39;d started crying so much.&#34;I&#39;m sorry for what happened. After everything,didn&#39;t expect them to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where did you bury them?!&#34; I asked in a more pained tone, my sobs rising a notch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt. So so bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I kept them somewhere safe.&#34; She breathed.&#34;actually thought the pain would be less if you didn&#39;t see them when you woke up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,you were wrong.Because for five years, I&#39;ve been looking for you. I&#39;ve been... looking for them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gods, I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; her voice broke, like she really was. &#34;If I had even the slightest idea, I promise I&#39;d have come to you myself, Lyric.&#34; She nodded. &#34;I&#39;ll take you to them tomorrow. Is that okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-Why can&#39;t it be today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned. &#34;Lyric, it&#39;s getting dark already. And I can&#39;t just abandon my husband. We have something important to do right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dipping her hand into her purse, she retrieved a pen and small piece of paper. &#34;Here. Call me whenever you&#39;re ready. I promise I&#39;ll take you to them. They&#39;ve been in a safe place, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She handed the paper to me with her number on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled as I wiped my face. She was right. It was getting dark already. I shouldn&#39;t expect her to take me to a cemetery by this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nice seeing you again, Lyric. Maybe we can catch up tomorrow.&#34; She gave me a hug before parting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For almost a minute after she left, I stayed rooted to the spot, still imagining everything to be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what was that about?&#34; Jace asked as soon as l returned to my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even say anything. I simply shook my head and went into the car.</p>
