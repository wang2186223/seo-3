                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shook at my sides, fresh fear eating me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wase any more time and started running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the chase from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop her! Get that lady!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t look back. I ran like my life depended on it-which of course it did. But there were too many of them.I feared they&#39;d catch up with me in no time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The streets were empty. I kept running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that they could easily shoot me, I took a turn,going into the woods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like an eternity of running. If only I had a wolf,it&#39;d have been much better. I was soon out of breath and needed to pause for a break, otherwise risk passing out. I hid behind an abandoned tree, saying a silent prayer in my heart that the Executioners wouldn&#39;t come this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to imagine what they&#39;d do to me if they laid hands on me. They might even kill me without taking me to Jaris and simply lie to everyone that I&#39;d tried to attack them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was I kidding? The Fates had never been entirely kind to me. It didn&#39;t take long before I heard their approaching footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must be close by. Check thoroughly.&#34; It&#39; was Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced the fastest it&#39;s ever had. I suddenly understood how people died of heart attacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to glance back to see their position so l&#39;d know where to ruin to. I gasped when I found one very close to me. Luckily, she hadn&#39;t seen me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My panic increased. If I were to leave my hiding spot and continue running, they&#39;d definitely see me,and judging from how close they were, they&#39;d catch me in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strong wind blew past me. I looked to my side and almost screamed when I found Caden standing beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes wide open, I gave him a head to toe look like he was a ghost. What was he doing here?! How did he find me? How was he so fast?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he also...have the Super Speed like Jaris?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes crinkled with amusement as he stared down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, there. Long time no see.&#34; His voice carried mirth, like this whole thing was a fun game to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard something! Over there,&#34; one of the Executioners said. I fearfully looked around before settling my eyes on Caden. What if he was here to make sure I got caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their footsteps were getting closer. I had to run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could take a step, Caden snatched my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll definitely get caught, Ly.&#34; He shook his head in disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he still talking!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go...!&#34; I tried to free my hand from his but it was useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, the Executioners caught up with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Found her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I nearly passed out. I was right!Caden was here to help them catch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, to my dismay, he smirked. &#34;Looking for someone? I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ll have to find someone else.I need this one.&#34; Before I could fully grasp the moment, his hand wrapped around me, lifted me off the ground, and off we went, running through the air at a speed that no wolf could catch up with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came to a stop in a deserted place. I was sure it was far from where the Executioners could find us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he set me on the ground, I stepped away and ran my hands along my skin, hoping to scrub away his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome,&#34; he scoffed, leaning against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shot him a steely glare before muttering a &#34;thanks.&#34;I might not like the guy, but he saved my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know I was there?&#34;|threw at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, in case you haven&#39;t noticed, a lot of people have been looking for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you were just smart enough to be the one  to find me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; he shrugged. &#34;Me and the Executioners. You should feel lucky we found you together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking away, but his hand shot out, holding mine. &#34;Where are you going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Home? Can you let me go?&#34; I forced my hand free form his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saving me didn&#39;t make him less of a monster to me.It didn&#39;t make me suddenly forget all he had done and was likely going to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a home, Lyric. It isn&#39;t safe,&#34; he told me the harsh truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what do you want me to do? Live off the streets until the Executioners find me? And what the hell do you care?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed. &#34;You should stay with me. You know you&#39;ll be more than safe in my place. None of those people would even dare to-&#34; &#34;Are you being serious?&#34; I scoffed, giving him a head-to-toe stare like he was ridiculous. &#34;You expect me to believe you actually care and come live with you? Have you gone nuts,Caden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;lf I didn&#39;t care, I wouldn&#39;t have saved you minutes ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bobbed. &#34;Maybe you do care. But because I&#39;m a Siphon, isn&#39;t it? You looking for a way to turn me into a tool.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be ridiculous. If I wanted to make you a tool,I&#39;d easily abduct you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, thanks but I don&#39;t want your help, Caden.I appreciate you saving me today, but please don&#39;t expect me to give you a hug for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I attempted leaving again, but he walked around and got in my way. &#34;Come on, Lyric. I&#39;m only trying to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m telling you to stay away from me! Please, I don&#39;t need your protection!&#34; The words finally seemed to sink in &#39;cause he didn&#39;t take another step toward me. So, I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have any intention of staying in the house.With the Executioners in the city, I knew it was only a matter of time before they found me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t just run off without anything.I needed to take my clothes and some personal things from the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was night by the time I reached. I kept looking around as I made my way into the house. What were the odds of the Executioners finding this very house?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried into the bedroom where | started gathering my things and cried in the process. My life was fucked up. Where would I possibly go from here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know a single person in the country that would want to be of help to me. I couldn&#39;t even go to my father as I knew the guards and Executioners would be on the lookout for me. Here, I was packing my bags without knowing a single thing about my next location. I just knew l needed to leave this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rounded up the packing and made my way to the living room. That was when a frost settled over my soul.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My bag slipped from my hand as I froze at the door.In front of me were the Executioners-a sight that shouldn&#39;t be possible. How in Hell&#39;s name were they here? I didn&#39;t hear them come into the house.</p>
