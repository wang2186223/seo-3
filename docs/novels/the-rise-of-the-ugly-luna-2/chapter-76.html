                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid in the bathtub, one leg splayed over the top with my head leaning backward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a long day. A crazy one. All I wanted to do was get some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staring into nothing, I thought of Jace&#39;s discovery.I still had a hard time believing what he said. Of course, Jace was my best friend, and he&#39;d never lie with something this serious. I just couldn&#39;t believe Marta could be that heartless and fearless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could she risk lying to the entire Darkspire? Like she was so certain the truth wouldn&#39;t reveal itself one day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tsked, thinking of the poor kids. Who were their real parents? And how would they feel getting to know that the parents they&#39;ve come to love weren&#39;t theirs? What would Jaris do when he learns the truth?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So many questions, it frightened me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath. I decided to think of something better. And of course, the only &#39;better&#39; memory I could come up with was the one of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop myself, my fingers were already on my wet core. I bit my lower lip, trying to suppress my moan, but in the end I failed. They came out just as shamelessly as I touched myself to a weird dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My scream echoed in the bathroom as I made myself cum. I panted heavily, squirming in the tub.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming down from my high, I was too exhausted to move a limb, and before I knew it, I was shedding tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried because it was too good. Cried because I wanted more but couldn&#39;t even have it. It was a stupid dream. How can a stupid dream have this effect on me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Marta hadn&#39;t come in when she did, I was certain the pen would&#39;ve snapped in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where were you, Marta? I called like an hour ago,&#34;I growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was running low on temper. Damn it This wasn&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry, Alpha. My grandmother called for me. I just got back and came running when I heard you summoned me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I regarded her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Came running&#39;, yet she&#39;s had the time to change into one of her red lace nighties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Came running&#39;, yet she&#39;s had the time to shower and brush her hair, judging from how damp her hair looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Came running,&#39; yet she&#39;s had the time to apply purple lipstick on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta looked fucking gorgeous right now. Since we met, she&#39;s been desperate for my attention and had been doing all she could to get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s put in more effort to seduce me than Lyric Harper has ever done. As a matter of fact, Lyric had never done anything seducing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, here I was, being tormented by my memory of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, my chair groaning as I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still wearing my suit pants and white top, only the jacket missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here, Marta,&#34; I ordered impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did, walking sensually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bulge in my pants was almost painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can do this, Jaris. You can take control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was close, I grabbed her by the neck, slamming my lips against hers. She moaned in response, throwing her arms around me and deepening the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can do this-l repeatedly told myself. I can use Marta as a distraction. I can get Lyric out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as I let my hands roam over Marta&#39;s body, they didn&#39;t feel like &#39;hers&#39;. They didn&#39;t bring out the kind of response Lyric did. Her hair didn&#39;t fucking smell like apple shampoo!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was different. She wasn&#39;t strong enough to get Lyric out of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed her to the edge of the table, wrapping her legs around my waist. Her hands were already working to unbutton my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shouldn&#39;t be difficult. I was already as hard as rock since she came into the room. She was horny for me too. All I had to do was take out my dick and fuck her senseless. Get it all out. Even if I won&#39;t be able to cum, it&#39;ll bring me some kind of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted more than just jerking myself in the bathroom. I wanted to feel myself deep inside her cunt, moving my hips and filling her up with my cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell has Lyric done to me? Why can&#39;t I think straight? Why can&#39;t I want anyone but her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hiss, I pulled away from Marta, my thumb caressing my lower lip. My shirt was parted into two.Marta&#39;s eyes were heavy with lust. She looked like she wanted to cry from the loss of contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; She stretched her hand to touch me, to pull me close. But I didn&#39;t let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t Lyric. No one could ever be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I contemplated if it had to do with the mate bond? Could it be the reason I was so desperate for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I remembered these delusions already started even before the mate bond. This... This was something different. &#34;Get out, Marta,&#34; I rasped, turning toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gasp was audible. &#34;J-Jaris...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give her the chance to speak. I know a lot must be going through her head. It was the second time I was giving her hope. But I was just as hopeless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as I pleasured myself with my hands in the bathroom, I came to a conclusion: I was done managing without Lyric Harper. The Moon knows I tried. I fucking tried to keep her out of the way. But now, I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting a taste of Lyric tomorrow.</p>
