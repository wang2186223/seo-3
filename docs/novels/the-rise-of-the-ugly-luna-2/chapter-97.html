                <p>I walked out of the patient&#39;s room, carrying the chart in my hand and going through it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I instructed the nurse beside me on what to do to one of the patients in the chart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came to a pause when someone stopped in front of me. I was forced to lift my head from the book, and in front of me was Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need something, Doctor Monroe?&#34; | resisted the urge to roll my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; She had a dubious smile on her face. &#34;How has life been without your best friend being close to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I widened my eyes at her. Was she really going to do this in front of a nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the nurse beside me, I dismissed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you, Marta?&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me? I mean, it&#39;s been two days since he was kicked out of the pack. How do you think that makes me feel?&#34; Her smile stretched. &#34;ReallyI walked out of the patient&#39;s room, carrying the chart in my hand and going through it.</p>

                <p>I widened my eyes at her. Was she really going to do this in front of a nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning to the nurse beside me, I dismissed her.</p>

                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me? I mean, it&#39;s been two days since he was kicked out of the pack. How do you think that makes me feel?&#34; Her smile stretched. &#34;Really good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have the time for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shaking my head, I walked past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, I&#39;d be very careful, Lyric.&#34; I stopped walking. &#34;I&#39;m not one of those bitches who would attack you without warning you. Right now, I&#39;m telling you to watch your back. Because you and your stupid friend will pay for what you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what exactly did we do?&#34; I snapped at her.&#34;All we wanted to do was reveal the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which turned out to be a lie. You almost took my kids from me. You almost took Jaris from me!&#34; She came forward, her feet nearly touching mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to make you pay. I&#39;ll make you regret trying to cross me. You&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had mixed emotions as I watched her leave. I was angry, but I couldn&#39;t deny being uncomfortable.Marta could be crazy sometimes.I know it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent extra hours at the hospital trying to arrange some things. Before I knew it, I was exhausted and passed out on my desk. The nap was so sweet and peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finally woke up, I gasped at the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?! It was past ten! How did I sleep for so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly gathered my things and left the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way to the car, I checked my phone and found several missed calls and texts from Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS: Where are you, Lyric? Do you even know what the time is?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was sent thirty minutes ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. Funny how he was concerned when he&#39;d ignored me for three days when Jace was locked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to call him back but couldn&#39;t reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling in my car, my phone lit up with a text.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face went from cool to mad when I saw the sender and the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick: How was work today, Ly? Do you need someone to tell all about it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was the asshole texting me? Like the first time, I didn&#39;t reply. I wasn&#39;t going to give him the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started my car and hit the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I vibed to a song as I drove with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until it wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came to a halt when I noticed two cars in front of me that were turned upside down. Beside them were people on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like an accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, I looked closely, and what I saw made my blood freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the victims were other people that had their fangs in their necks. They seemed like wolves judging from the yellow glint of their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what unsettled me was the fact that they seemed to be sucking from the necks of the victims on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they sucking off? Their blood?My heart thundered in my chest as I watched the terrific scene. This wasn&#39;t normal. None of it was.Wolves shouldn&#39;t be sucking from other wolves. What was the meaning of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, a million thoughts crossed my mind.I contemplated calling Jaris. But before I could reach my phone, one of the strange wolves turned his head at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes rounded, my heart stopped working and my lips parted without a sound coming out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think. I shifted into gear, turned the wheel and made a quick u-turn. But from the corner of my eyes,I saw them coming after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove as fast as I could, but they were also fast,and in no time, they were ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were they doing? They shouldn&#39;t be in front of a moving car!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shook on the steering as I stepped on the gas pedal. Maybe I could run over them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t have the chance as, to my surprise, they flipped my car over when I reached them. I screamed so hard as I landed roughly with my car. My entire body crashed along with it, heavy pains hitting me everywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I thought I&#39;d pass out. Or worse, die.Not having a wolf was terrible. There was no backup for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My car was turned upside down when it stopped moving. They kicked my door open and dragged me out to the ground, but not before I managed to grab something from the back of my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; I whimpered, sharp pains still shooting through my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who were they? How could they be this powerful to do this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. She&#39;s a fine one,&#34; one of them said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was laying on the ground while the three of them stood hovering over me. They didn&#39;t look familiar in any way, and they had blood on their lips. Clearly,they&#39;d been sucking the blood of those people on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did the same fate await me? Were they going to suck my blood as well? Kill me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought brought tears to my eyes. This whole thing was terrifying. No wolf should be able to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should taste her first,&#34; one said to another. &#34;I doubt I&#39;ll be able to stop when I start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They chuckled and the one that had been spoken to started coming closer.</p>
