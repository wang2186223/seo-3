                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a while to get over Jaris&#39; action that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that I argued with him. But I only wanted answers. And maybe I did get a little paranoid, but |wouldn&#39;t really blame myself with everything that&#39;s been happening to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,how could he growl at me? His beast has been so close to the surface. He could&#39;ve easily hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got ready for my afternoon shift and left with Jace and the guard Jaris assigned to me. I was overly quiet during the ride, staring out the window and trying not to cry at the recollection of my argument with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twice we&#39;ve tried to have dinner, and twice something had ruined it. It was as if even the universe was fighting against us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a complex surgery to perform today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going through the patient&#39;s file when Marta barged into my office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing, Lyric?&#34; She asked as soon as she entered, leaving me temporarily confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you attend to my patients today?&#34; She clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, it&#39;s unprofessional to just barge into people&#39;s offices. There&#39;s a doorfor a reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damm it, answer my question! Have you lost your mind? What gave you the right to go to them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help my smile. &#34;Why are you so worked up about it? Every patient is our responsibility in here. Or...are they requesting for me now instead of you?&#34; I knew the very patients she was referring to. Those were our VIPs. People who held powerin our world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors and nurses always thrived to attend to these patients because they looked forward to being owed a favour by them. Marta had been in charge of four, and immediately I arrived today, I went to them.Of course, it was easy for sweet Lyric to be liked by all. It was even easier when I secretly siphoned their pain and made them more relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are all shared into separate tasks, Lyric,&#34; Marta approached with a fierce look, her eyes shooting icy arrows straight to the heart. &#34;I&#39;ll not say this again. Don&#39;t ever go near any patient of mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t tell me what to do anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you stupid? I&#39;m your superior!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. Ugh. Superior, my ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes to show I didn&#39;t care, and that seemed to infuriate her the more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a threatening look before storming out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgery was a success. Everyone was happy about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the last thing I had to do for the day. So, after cleaning up, I was gathering my things in the office to go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only I didn&#39;t exactly feel like going home. Maybe I could go pay a visit to Juan and Becky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was fixing up my bag when my door opened. For the love of the Moon, what was it with people and barging into my office today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got even worse when I looked up and discovered it was Kayla and Margot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please don&#39;t come into my office without knocking,&#34; I couldn&#39;t keep the bitterness from my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both stop at the doorway, giving me a weird look from head to toe. &#34;Do you need something?&#34; |asked when they wouldn&#39;t say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. We&#39;ve just been curious. How did you cope with the knowledge that four people died because of your carelessness?&#34; Kayla asked. &#34;Those people had been getting better already. But they were snatched out of the arms of their loved ones because some stupid doctor was careless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt my cheeks blaze at her insult.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill them.&#34; I was already tired of saying those words when no one ever believed them. &#34;Besides, the incident is in the past and has been settled. You have no right to come to my office and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please!&#34; Margot waved her hand in the air to.cut me off. &#34;How were you just suspended for three weeks?! Your license should&#39;ve been seized! You shouldn&#39;t be allowed to practice for the rest of your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, she was behind under the shelter of Alpha Jaris. I bet being mated to him is your biggest achievement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you rather he&#39;s mated to you?&#34; | snapped at them. &#34;Because right now you two sound so pained.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please spare us. We know it&#39;s your highest achievement to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you answer the question?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the one who interrupted them. It was a male voice-one I&#39;d recognize anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped and looked behind them, but I couldn&#39;t see him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when they turned and gasped, I knew he was there. He was probably behind the door which was why l couldn&#39;t see him yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Alpha Jaris!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings,Alpha!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We-We didn&#39;t know you were here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps, then Jaris was finally visible to me. His eyes were winter cold as they looked at me, then at the doctors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I guess I&#39;ll need to have a discussion with your superior, because i seems there must have introduced a new rule that gives freedom to people like you to intimidate others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No. Not at all, Alpha! We were just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;I still get punished for this. But the next time you bother her, it&#39;ll be the last time you work as a ddoctor here. And trust me, I&#39;ll know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even I was intimidated from where I stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors bowed their heads clumsily. It was funny how they were so scared when their mouths had been so sharp a minute ago. Well, only a fool wouldn&#39;t fear Jaris, especially now that he was about to become Alpha King. He could get a lot of things done without stress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors ran off, not even glancing back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was finally able to think clearly. What was Jaris doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; I nervously grabbed the strap of my bag. His words and anger from that morning still terrified me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the doorframe, his hands in his pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t resist a peek at him. He looked like a gentleman. A very handsome one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he&#39;s dangerous, Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s also the father of your kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat at the thought. If my twins were really alive, they&#39;d be children to Jaris Dreadmoor.Would I tell him about it? I hadn&#39;t even thought of it yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You done for the evening?&#34; He asked, his voice calm and different from the hostility he&#39;d used on the doctors a while ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; How did he even know? He moved away from the doorframe. &#34;Let&#39;s go, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You...came to pick me up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;Looks like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.Um...I&#39;H need to call Jace and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already took care of Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a little stunned. He really planned this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; I grabbed my bag and left the office with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about this felt sweet. Knowing we&#39;d just argued that morning and this evening he was coming to get me from work. It sent a delightful shiver through my stomach, like bubbles dancing inside.</p>
