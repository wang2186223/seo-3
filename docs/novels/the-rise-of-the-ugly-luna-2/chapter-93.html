                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was reading a book on my phone when a text popped on my screen, freezing the air in my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Hi, Lyric. Have you missed me?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was from Roderick, and it was accompanied with a photo of me at the airport from when I newly came into the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? He had taken a photo of me that day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most importantly, why was he texting me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doorbell ringing interrupted my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrambled off the bed and into the living room to check who it was. The kids were in their room, playing a video game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who could possibly be visiting Jaris?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door and was met with surprise when l found Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike her, she didn&#39;t have any makeup on. Her hair looked like it had been hurriedly brushed and parked. Her eyes were swollen, indicating she had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Marta Monroe looking pale. It was a rare sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me from head to heel with disgust. In her state, that didn&#39;t look good on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are my kids?&#34; Her voice came out croaky</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you even doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away. Gods, I wasn&#39;t mentally prepared for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how dare you take my kids without my permission, Lyric? Have you lost it? If you need kids to control,go get yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes snapped at her.Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s dumb coming from you, Marta. And I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in any position to make such remarks.You know, considering the fact that these kids are not even yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darkened just before she slapped me. This time, I didn&#39;t hesitate. I hit her back and pushed her so hard she almost fell on her butts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I was clear when I told you never to lay your filthy hands on me!?&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She chuckled as she brushed her fingers into her hair.But I could see tears glistening in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lyric.&#34; She laughed. &#34;Dear Lyric. How bold you have become.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to retort something when a car pulled up behind Marta. It was one of Jaris&#39; cars. Marta also turned around for a look, and we watched as Jaris stepped out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment, his gaze lingering on Marta.Then,he continued walking,wearing a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; Gone was the feisty look on Marta&#39;s face.Now shw looked pathetic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; Jaris asked coldly as he stopped before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m sorry. I just came to see the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris nodded, then looked at me. &#34;Bring the kids out to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Jaris, come on. I can see them inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s be clear, Marta. The only reason I&#39;m not kicking you out is because the kids are here and you have the right to see them. Don&#39;t ever make the mistake of thinking you can come anywhere near me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glistened with tears. &#34;This isn&#39;t fair,you know?Just letting a random guy ruin our lives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; gaze was colder when he looked at me again.&#34;I told you to get the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He huffed and walked past me before I even went into the house. He went into the kitchen and Marta didn&#39;t dare come in with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got the kids and left them with Marta outside the house before going to meet Jaris in the kitchen.He seemed really pissed. He&#39;d been that way since he exited his car. Did it just have to do with Marta?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are-Are you alright, Alpha?&#34; I leaned against the wall,remembering he&#39;d gotten an urgent call that made him leave the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am,&#34; he grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? You don&#39;t look-&#34; I stopped when he sighed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Maybe I was bothering him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There was an attack on some of our people,&#34; he mumbled, going back tos to stirring what was in the cup. Ooh. Jaris was opening up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But did he say an attack?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How? What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went ahead to tell me about a Rebel attack that happened in a strange way. He sounded really pissed about it. Well, of course. Jaris hated when people messed with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be found and justice will be served,&#34; I assured him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the door opening and returned to the living room to find Marta bringing the kids in</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,seriously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, come on. He told you not to come in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my face, bitch. I&#39;m only bringing my kids in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth dropped open, shocked at the fact that she used an unfiltered curse word in front of the kids.I don&#39;t even think she noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer to me, speaking in a lowered tone so only me could hear.-&#34;1won&#39;t let this happen. This whole thing you&#39;re trying to do-stealing my kids&#39; trust and attention and wanting to play the boss of Jaris&#39;home.&#34; She scoffed. &#34;I&#39;ll die before I let youI take my place,Lyric. Let this sink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head in disbelief. &#34;With everything going on, that&#39;s all you&#39;re concerned about? Position? Do you even care about the well-being of your kids? Are you concerned about how all of these would affect them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, shut up. Stop trying to play mummy here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, you need help, Marta. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you really bought these kids to claim your position beside Jaris. After all, that&#39;s all that matters to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned darker. She looked like she was about to hit me, but Jaris&#39; voice rang through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta.Out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She balled her hands into fists as she looked at him.&#34;Jaris-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me do something nasty in front of the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids looked so confused. They kept sliding their gaze from one face to another, probably wondering what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. They&#39;ve seen enough. &#34;Come on, now,&#34; I took their hands. &#34;Let&#39;s go play games.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took them upstairs, leaving Jaris and his baby mama to sort themselves. Although, considering who Jaris was, I was sure it wouldn&#39;t take him anything to kick Marta out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The evening went pretty smooth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids demanded ice cream, and instead of ordering one,Jaris suggested we all go out to get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised and enthralled when he asked me to come along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat in the front seat next to him while the kids played with their tabs in the backseat. Along the way,they got into an argument over a headset. They had identical headsets and only one was in the car. Xyla claimed it was hers, but Xylon insisted it was also his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before we knew it, Xyla was already crying as Xylon was the one holding strongly to the headset and wouldn&#39;t let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, honey. It&#39;s okay. The second one must be at home. When we get back, you can use it.&#34; I turned partially to rub her legs. &#34;No! This one&#39;s mine. I wvant it!&#34; She tuned the volume of her cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris simply sighed and shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, I think it&#39;d have been much better if they&#39;d gotten different colors,&#34; I whispered to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not my fault. The store only had one color left when I went to get it,&#34; he answered without taking his eyes off the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought real hard on a solution. Neither of them was sure who owned it, and one would be hurt if the other got to use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gently, I took it from Xylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There. No one is using it, okay? When we get home,I&#39;ll give it back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon made a pout but didn&#39;t protest. Xyla stopped crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez! Kids could be really dramatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Settling back in my seat and staring out the window,I thought of the ones I lost. I imagined them being Xylon and Xyla. I imagined us in this very position-Jaris driving, me in the passenger seat, and the kids fighting in the backseat. A small smile touched my lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at the realization of how beautiful my life would&#39;ve been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t always get what we wanted in life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the ice cream truck and the kids ended up ordering for more things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We spent some time in the park, which was really fun.I almost didn&#39;t want us to go back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, I took the pill and Jaris came to me in my dream. He made sweet love to me, completing my day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were having breakfast when Jaris got a call. I noticed him hesitate before taking the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Beatrix.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that name. That was the doctor performing the DNA test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My spine straightened, my curiosity going to its peak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Have it delivered here.&#34; Jaris ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that...&#34; I glanced at the kids. He simply nodded before returning to his meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, Beatrix arrived with the result. She said hello to the kids before leaving, because Jaris asked her to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood alone at the dining with him as he opened the envelope. For the first time, I saw Jaris Dreadmoor nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took out the result, and I watched as his eyes moved around the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, he was quiet, his eyes still on the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What does it say?&#34; I couldn&#39;t believe my voice was almost shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw clenched as he folded the paper and fixed it back into the envelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get the kids. We&#39;re going to the Pack.&#34; His voice was like ice as he spoke and walked away.</p>
