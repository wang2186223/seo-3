                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands were shaking as I ran into TCH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jaris wasn&#39;t with me and I had to be the one to drive here, there was no doubt I&#39;d have gotten into an accident somehow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so damn nervous,Guinevere&#39;s words tormenting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;They&#39;re dead! All the patients are dead.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she mean by that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was all shaky and panicking, Jaris was the opposite. He remained calm and collected, clearly trying to tell me to do the same. But I could see the concern in his face. He was worried for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we waited in the elevator, he took my hand,squeezing it tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s going to be fine. Calm down.&#34; His voice was honeyed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, I had no idea how badly I needed to hear those words until now. But was that even true? The elevator doors opened and we rushed out to the floor where Guinevere and a team of other doctors stood. There were nurses and a lot of people everywhere, most of them crying. And to my horror,two covered bodies were being rolled out of a ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank into the lowest pit possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do,Lyric?&#34; Guinevere&#39;s voice was cold as she came toward me. &#34;Tell me. How did this happen? How did you inject them with Thilax?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You murderer!&#34; One of the women crying suddenly pointed at me. &#34;You killed my husband.You killed my husband!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll pay for this!&#34; Another shouted, a younger girl this time. &#34;Did someone ask you to do this? Was it Jerry? Are you working with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My sister was getting better!&#34; Someone else from a different corner sobbed. &#34;We were supposed to be discharged tomorrow. How could you do this to her?How could you kill her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were so many voices being raised at me. So many accusing fingers. I couldn&#39;t breathe. It was too much to handle. I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the women rushed at me. Another man followed her, their faces looking so threatening. Yet,I didn&#39;t even have the strength to move. I simply stood there,jaws dropped as they came at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Touch her and lose those hands.&#34; Jaris stepped in front of me, stopping them from reaching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded so threatening, using his Alpha authority.They stopped instantly, but their hateful glares didn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the doctors came close. &#34;Lyric. This way.&#34; She gestured at the path leading to the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs moved on their own. Right now,they could be leading me into a pit of fire and I wouldn&#39;t even know or be able to help myself.I felt so numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even realize Jaris&#39; hand was on the small of my back. I couldn&#39;t feel a thing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got into the elevator, went up to the next floor and into her office. It didn&#39;t take long before Guinevere and three other doctors joined us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What in Moon&#39;s name happened, Lyric?&#34; The woman before me asked. She was a superior in a different  department. But all the same, she held a lot of power.&#34;I was told that those were your patients. They reacted to Thilax which should not have been ingested in the first place! What happened?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was racing too fast. There were so many judgy eyes on me. Even Guinevere that always admired me now looked at me with anger. They were all so disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jaris beside me. Gods, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do if he wasn&#39;t here right now. These people would&#39;ve likely swallowed me whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t give them...&#34; I managed to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about? They&#39;re your patients,Lyric. We found Thilax in their system.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;It-It can&#39;t be.l-I only injected them with Calmizol. That was all I did. I didn&#39;t administer Thilax to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard their huffs as they looked at each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to lie to get yourself out of this situation, young lady?&#34; The superior said in a strict tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Why would I lie about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we never Calmizol in their system. All we found was Thilax which was wrongfully administered.It&#39;s the reason they&#39;re dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? My brows furrowed in confusion as tears leaked from my eyes. Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it,&#34; I muttered, shaking my head as I stared down at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it possible you picked the wrong bottle?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; This time I shouted. I was losing my mind.&#34;know what I took. It was Calmizol. I&#39;ve used them long enough to know their differences. Plus the label was clear enough. I couldn&#39;t have made such a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t look like they believed me. They gave me those judgy looks like I&#39;d just committed mass murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe I had.Four people were dead. I knew their names. Aaron, Jasper, Carys, Elena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could they be dead? Just a few hours ago, they were all fine. They shouldn&#39;t be dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not just that; everyone believed it was my fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t do it.&#34; | sobbed. &#34;I don&#39;t know how it happened. But I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a hand on my back. Jaris. &#34;Well, maybe you should explain that to the families mourning out there!&#34; One of the doctors pointed at the door. &#34;This is a grave mistake, Lyric. You should&#39;ve been more careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, they were not listening! They didn&#39;t believe me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; Jaris&#39; voice was cold. &#34;She said she didn&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... pardon us, Alpha Jaris. But we&#39;re clueless here.A lot of people are dead, and it is obvious she made a mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; I whimpered, shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything came crashing down on me-the pain of those people actually dying, the fact that I was being blamed, the fear that no one believed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is too heavy to be swept under the rug,&#34;Guinevere sighed.&#34;The board will need an explanation.She&#39;ll have to answer for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods. Oh, gods. Oh,gods. I chanted repeatedly in my head. This was happening. It was my downfall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were right. I&#39;ll need to get punished for this.And judging by the number of deaths, it won&#39;t be easy.I might lose my license and get kicked out for good. I&#39;ll never be able to work as a doctor again. Gods,no. Please, no.Please,no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole life had been centered on this. This was what I&#39;ve always wanted to be. How could I lose it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and went shut. It was me. I was running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard my name from the office I&#39;d just left, but l didn&#39;t stop running. I couldn&#39;t.</p>
