                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would he do this to me?&#34; I whimpered against father&#39;s chest. &#34;I thought we had a deal. I thought he wanted this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The humiliation was crippling. Twice, I tried to end this deal, but he wouldn&#39;t let me. Did he only push it this far just to humiliate me? Was I cursed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; I heard Luna Isolde call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, I lifted my face off father&#39;s chest for a look, and there he was, striding into the hall with a look of cold detachment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face remained pale as I watched him. He did come. After three excruciating hours? After all the guests had left!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, where have you been?&#34; Luna Isolde asked in a cutting whisper when he reached her side. But Jaris walked past her without sparing her a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t spare me a glance either as he walked down the aisle, stopping in front of the altar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestess must have been informed of his arrival, because she stepped out again, taking her place at the altar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d stopped whimpering, but my tears were still flowing.Was this a joke?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper.Please,&#34; The Priestess pointed to the spot where I was to stand before Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my body wasstone cold. I could hardly even blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. Come on.&#34; Father stood up, pulling me along with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even have the strength to take my bouquet along. It was a miracle I was able to walk without falling. My makeup was already ruined by my tears, no doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was ruined!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was taken to the altar to stand before Jaris. His face was stone cold, like the part of him I despised. He wouldn&#39;t even look at me. At that point, he looked like he&#39;d rather be listening to the sound of nails scraping against a chalkboard than be here with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; My voice was barely above a whisper, the pain still evident. &#34;We&#39;ve been waiting...for three hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still wouldn&#39;t look at me. The expression on his face terrified me, just as much as it wounded me. What was wrong with him!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips quivered as I glared at him. He hurt me. Abandoned me. Yet he had the nerves to stand here and act all grumpy!? Oh,really?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was even more painful that I couldn&#39;t do anything about it. He was the only one with the right to terminate the contract. All I could do was stand her and take all the bullshit he offered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Priestess started the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my teary gaze to the floor, praying for the strength not to break down in front of him. But who was I kidding? I was already a weeping mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long procedure and proclamations, Jaris and I were mated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She retrieved a jar of ribbon and guided us into knotting it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations,Jaris Dreadmoor and Lyric Dreadmoor.Henceforth, you are both one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The very few people in the hall clapped. But even I could notice how sad it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would&#39;ve thought that this very day that I looked up to would turn out to be the worst day of my life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to say something!&#34; I said in a near-cry as I ran after Jaris who had stormed out of the hall as soon as the Priestess joined us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t just leave like nothing happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking, taking a while longer than necessary to turn to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were so cold, devoid of any warmth or affection. I couldn&#39;t see the man that had made me blush in the last couple of days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s get one thing straight, Lyric Harper,&#34; he started toward me, so intimidating. I stood my ground, forcing myself not to retreat. &#34;I only came here &#39;cause you&#39;re a necessity. Because I need you for something. But know this-you&#39;re to stay as far away from me as possible. I&#39;ll have nothing to do with you. And hopefully, the year runs quickly so we can put an end to this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? Tears streaked my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you say this?&#34; I asked when he turned around. &#34;I thought we were... I thought we were good.&#34; My voice broke at the last word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t felt pain this deep in a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me again,his eyes not any warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I should&#39;ve known you were all the same.&#34; He stared down at me in a degrading manner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did that mean by that? What in hell did I do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away from me.&#34; He added and left, going into his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remained there, sobs wracking my shoulders as I watched the car drive off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was gone. He hated me. But what exactly did I do to deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Lyric.&#34; Jace tapped me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned and fell into his arms, letting my tears run free. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything. I don&#39;t deserve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sshh. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s fine.&#34; He cooed, stroking my hair. MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta kept looking around as she met with Zarek a short distance from the temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you come here? What if someone sees us?&#34; She asked with a snarl, her eyes darting around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that would be your problem, not mine. If you hadn&#39;tignored my calls earlier, I wouldn&#39;t be here,&#34; Alpha Zarek gritted the words. He was pissed. &#34;What happened? I told you I loved playing fair!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rolled her eyes. &#34;Well, it was fair, wasn&#39;t it? She willingly followed you to the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, she kept moaning the name of another! She thought I was Jaris. Can you explain that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, I&#39;m really not in the mood for this. You got what you wanted. As for me, I&#39;m the one at a loss here because they still got mated!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek roughly seized her wrist, making it hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing? Let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in the dark. No one could see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ruined my plans, you know that? I wanted her to fall for me. That was how I wanted to win the game!When you told me you could help, I thought you had something good up your sleeves. You told me you wouldn&#39;t use any of your grandmother&#39;s...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I told you I was only going to help you play fair. She willingly kissed you and went along with you.What game can be fairer than that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek released her hand, but the rage in his eyes remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt deceived. The potion was meant to hypnotize and make her see the face of the man she loved. He was a bit surprised that Lyric loved Jaris that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least, tell me you slept with her. Give me something good to help with this mood,&#34; Marta said with pain in her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re sick if you think l&#39;d sleep with a woman while she&#39;s moaning the name of another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh!&#34; She grunted in frustration. &#34;I hate this! I shouldn&#39;t have helped you if I had known, since you&#39;re so ungrateful.&#34; She stepped toward him, meeting his gaze with defiance. &#34;This should be the last time you contact me. You and I, our business is over. Don&#39;t get me in trouble because, well, you&#39;d be in trouble too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on her hell and walked away, fury bubbling within her core.</p>
