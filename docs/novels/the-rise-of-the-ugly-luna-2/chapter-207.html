                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know his name, but he did work for me six years ago. He quit the job a few months later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,one of my staff had lied against me to push Lyric away? I knew there was no way this staff would&#39;ve done this on his own. Somebody must&#39;ve definitely asked him to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have him found and questioned,&#34; I told Lyric as I put the envelope back away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is it really necessary? I mean, we&#39;re already together, right? Shouldn&#39;t we just let the past be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; my tone came out harsher than intended. &#34;This son of a bitch is the reason we got separated for six years. If we&#39;d been together, I&#39;d have taken good care of you and the babies. Who knows, they might&#39;ve survived. You wouldn&#39;t have gotten into trouble by awakening Caden. Do you understand that a lot of things wouldn&#39;t have been happening right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, clearly seeing my point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hope to the moon there are people around when l find out who this person is, because there was no telling what I&#39;d do to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood at the balcony, watching Lyric return to her seat in the field where the people surrounded her,like she was a savior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all bowed their heads at her, gladly welcoming her as she took her seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept watching for a long time as Lyric helped the people through siphoning, and each second that passed only worked to increase her bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, the people started coming to Lyric with offerings. Some brought huge envelopes,foodstuff and even deer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is she now, a goddess?&#34; Marta scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As painful as it was, it was clear that Lyric was stealing the spotlight. Here, she was, the Grand Luna, with the people passing by and hardly even acknowledging her. Yet, Lyric was down there, being worshipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hate Marta felt could not even be described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her phone vibrated in her bag. She hissed as she took it out, then discovered it was one of her &#39;men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked to a more private part of the building before answering the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t think Penelope is dead, ma&#39;am,&#34; he reported, making Marta&#39;s heart to freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What&#39;re you talking about? Haven&#39;t you found the body?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ve had my people from far and near comb the entire water. Her body should&#39;ve floated at some point. The lack of it means she might&#39;ve survived,somehow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand shook before she slowly balled it into a fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute, she was taken aback, her heart racing wildly beneath her skin</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do we find her?&#34; She gulped hard. &#34;If she&#39;s alive somewhere, we need to find her! You should know how important this is!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand. I already have my men checking some hospitals.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea suddenly clicked in her head. &#34;Hold on; l need you to check for something else. Find out if she has any relatives. It&#39;s possible she&#39;s hiding with someone she trusts. A family member is a good place to start.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am. Will get to work at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta groaned when the call ended. &#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope needed to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But if she was alive, why hadn&#39;t she come to expose her yet? Or was she still in recovery?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter. She&#39;d be the first to find her, and she&#39;d put an end to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just finished from a meeting and returned to my room to find Marta waiting outside. I understood the only reason she wasn&#39;t waiting inside was because l had the door locked. I didn&#39;t want anyone snooping in my room while I was away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered me a smile and now when I got close.&#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the guards with me opened the door and l went in with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was the meeting?&#34; She asked in a warm tone. &#34;It was fine, Marta. What is it?&#34; Mine was harsher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to act normal around Marta MMonroe.There were times when I wished someone like her didn&#39;t exist in my life. But then, my kids wouldn&#39;t have existed. So, I guess I had her to thank for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only she was a better person, maybe we wouldn&#39;t have this problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I just came around to remind you of the plan with the kids. You know, we&#39;re supposed to go see that new movie together with-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know. I remember.&#34; How could I possibly forget?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled. &#34;I&#39;ll get them ready, then. See you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I breathed a sigh of relief when she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a shower and came out to see my phone ringing. It was from a strange number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked the call and went stiff when I heard the familiar voice of my brother. &#34;Jaris.&#34; There was no mirth in his voice like it often had. Caden sounded serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That should be &#39;Your Highness&#39; to you,&#34;I corrected him,going to stand before the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the things and people out there, but they couldn&#39;t do the same. Otherwise, it&#39;d have been funny to see their King standing half naked with a towel around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I guess I should be congratulating you, then.You won.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the bitterness that coated his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d actually been expecting some sort of retaliation from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk,&#34; he added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, keep talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to make a proposal. I&#39;m ready to leave with the rest of the Feeders. I&#39;ll put a stop to my plan and just vanish. You&#39;ll never be troubled by me or any of the Feeders, ever again. What do you say, Jar?&#34; My mood was already getting sour, &#39;cause I knew the asshole was about to ask for something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the fucking condition?&#34; | snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated. &#34;Lyric. I want to leave with her.&#34;</p>
