                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, for someone who&#39;s about to become the Luna of the Almighty Darkspire, I don&#39;t think this is a great idea,&#34; Jace said as I downed my sixth shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please!&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;Don&#39;t act like you&#39;re not enjoying this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed,confirming my suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I returned to the top stage,taking up the mic, singing and dancing the stupid dance steps l could come up with in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were funny, I knew. All I knew how to do best was sway my hips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man came up to hold me around my waist</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nope. I was done with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just dance alone now, will ya? I&#39;m done dancing with others.&#34;I winked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked displeased but left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sang and laughed happily for a long time. Ooh! The people seemed to really like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I descended the stage to take more shots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sing beautifully,&#34; a young fine man said when l took the last step down the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flashed a smile at him. &#34;Thank you, gentleman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re really beautiful.&#34; He added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another smile. &#34;I know. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, he held my hand. &#34;Would you mind dancing with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. It felt like I&#39;d danced with almost everyone already. &#34;Sorry, you should&#39;ve come earlier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freed my hand and returned to Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, do you know who that is?&#34; He looked amused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at the man to see him walking back to a booth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I can&#39;t know everyone, Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Well, look to your right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did, and the face I saw made me want to puke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michelle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little bullying bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? She was here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, she wasn&#39;t just here, she was also glaring at me like I had taken her candies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While you were up there, displaying your awful vocal skills, she came in with him. And I do not need a soothsayer to tell me they share a thing. Apparently,the young man seems to share that very thing with others.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked back at the man who had joined a couple of boys.Oh... &#34;Well, first of all, I don&#39;t have terrible vocal skills.Have you seen how people clamour when I&#39;m up there? Secondly, looks like Michelle is still very lucky with getting the good guys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And back then, she always made it clear to me that l could never get the good guys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not to make you sad, honey, but I think the words the people were clamoring were &#39;get down from that stage.&#39; And to answer your question about Michelle&#39;s boyfriend, just asked you for a dance, and you turned him down. Don&#39;t you feel like making someone a little jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea sounded funny to me. I was almost dismissing it when I looked at Michelle again and had second thoughts. She used to be a real bitch back then, and now, I could get a little bit of revenge on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a genius, Jace. Anyone ever told you that?&#34; I giggled and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked up to the fine man who seemed surprised to see me. And at such perfect timing, Michelle was just coming around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi! Still want that dance?&#34; I kept my eyes on the man&#39;s and didn&#39;t evenlook her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t. Why don&#39;t you go pick someone else?&#34;The bully said, irritation in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, well, well. I might dislike her, but I couldn&#39;t deny the fact that she had grown into a very beautiful woman. Michelle had always been beautiful, and back then, a part of me had been intimidated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Michelle.&#34; I waved at her. Surprise crumpled her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I know you,witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, but your boyfriend asked me for a dance.You&#39;re not the restricting type, are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was already on his feet, holding out his hand. &#34;Please, dance with me.&#34; Grinning with happiness, I took his hand. To Michelle,I winked. &#34;I&#39;m Lyric, by the way. The name should sound familiar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her jaw drop while I proceeded to the dance floor with her date.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. Sure feels good to be beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his hand around my waist and we danced into forgetfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was finally pressed and needed to use the restroom.But I didn&#39;t leave without taking one more shot at the counter. When I got there, Jace wvas surprisingly gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. Maybe he had to take a call or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I proceeded to the restroom and was about to go in when I noticed I was being followed. Turning around,I found two men in front of me. One was Michelle&#39;s boyfriend. He said his name was Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other, I did not recognize. &#34;Hey, this is for the ladies,&#34; I gave them disapproving looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, we know. My friend just wants to talk to you.&#34;The strange guy said, tipping his head toward Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O...kay. Well, just in case this is new to you,most people aren&#39;t comfortable having conversations in restrooms. People like me, mostly. So, why don&#39;t you step out and we could talk when I&#39;m-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I think here&#39;s just better,&#34; Josh cut me off,coming toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at them, beady-eyed. What did they think they were doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly dawned on me. We were in a restroom,alone, in a noisy bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Josh... step back,&#34; I warned while retreating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly laughed. &#34;Please, I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m here to do anything stupid. Believe me, I&#39;ll never force myself on a woman. I&#39;m just here to talk.&#34; Well, that did nothing to calm me. &#34;Like I said, we could talk outside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, okay. Fine.&#34; He held up hishands in surrender.&#34;You got it, I&#39;ll just wait outside. It&#39;s just that, what I have to say is really important. And I&#39;m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked his head at his friend. &#34;Come on, Matt.Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still took a step back, but there was a little bit of water on the floor, and the slippery thing tripped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed as I lost balance, my body going toward the floor. Josh came to me in one swift move,putting his arms around me, steadying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Matt had already opened the door,and before him was a face he didn&#39;t recognize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are-&#34; Before he could finish the question, his heart was ripped out of his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes opened wide in horror as I looked at the face of the man who now came into view when Matt dropped dead on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing there at the doorframe, with a pulsing heart in his hand was Jaris.</p>
