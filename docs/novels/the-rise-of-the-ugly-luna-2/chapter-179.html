                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed me roughly to the floor while I clutched my belly. And she wasn&#39;t even done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She got on top of me, hit me repeatedly-in the face,shoulders, and everywhere her hands could touch. I was too focused on protecting my belly to defend any other part of my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy, please stop!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids were on her, dragging her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop touching me!&#34; She snapped as she turned to them, her voice like a tempest. &#34;You should be taking my side, both of you! I amyour mother! And she-she&#39;ll always be nothing but an intruder. The earlier you get that into your tiny skull, the better it&#39;ll be for all of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands balled into fists, wanting so badly to make her pay. But I couldn&#39;t even lift myself from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two guards showed up at the door. How convenient for them to finally hear the noise when she was done beating me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Luna Lyric. Are you alright?&#34; They helped me from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tummy still hurt and I couldn&#39;t stop holding it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta threw a venomous stare at me. &#34;This isn&#39;t over.I&#39;ll make sure you regret ever crossing me.&#34; She dragged the children out of the room with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of my body hurt from where she had hit me.The unbelievable witch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we need to call a doctor?&#34; One of the guards asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,please.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, just take these again by morning, you&#39;ll be completely fine. The bruises shouldn&#39;t be too serious as they weren&#39;t fierce,&#34; the doctor explained while I listened to her room where I laid on my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing Marta&#39;s punches were nothing like Caden&#39;s. Otherwise, I&#39;d have been turning in pain by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a reason my belly hurt that much when she hit me?&#34; | found it a little strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually,&#34; she went through my kadek. &#34;When was the last time you saw your period, Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows, thinking it through. &#34;Last month...fifth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, it&#39;s been more than a month. I&#39;ll um... actually suggest a pregnancy test in this case.&#34; I could see the smile she was trying so hard to suppress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it with these people and forcing pregnancy on me? I wasn&#39;t fucking pregnant!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like me to conduct one for you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? No!&#34; I flinched. &#34;Trust me, there&#39;s no need for that.&#34; 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible for someone to get pregnant without sex? Hell no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, Luna.&#34; Her response came hesitant. &#34;This will be all for now. In case you need anything else, please don&#39;t hesitate to call me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was deep asleep when I felt strong hands on me,shaking me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric! Lyric!&#34; I came awake with a start to find Jaris sitting on the edge of the bed,his face filled with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That worry morphed into anger when he looked into my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck happened? Why did Marta get into a fight with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a tired breath. &#34;We had a disagreement at the hospital. She was...upset with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she did this to you?&#34; His brows arched in disbelief. &#34;Fuck, she&#39;s definitely going to regret it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please.&#34; I sat up and held his hand.&#34;Maybe she has the right to be mad at me considering what I did to her at the hospital. It&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still seemed displeased, but fortunately, he didn&#39;t insist anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid back on the bed, staring into his eyes while my heart beat erratically in my chest. Guinevere and the doctor&#39;s words haunted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;Ll actually suggest a pregnancy test in this case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump formed in my throat as I imagined myself actually being pregnant for Jarisagain in this situation.He already had two loving kids, and our contract would be expiring in ten months. What would his reaction be if I actually became pregnant? I didn&#39;t want to imagine how disappointed he would be and probably hurt me with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew I was not pregnant. It was simply not possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, I felt much better, especially after I took my drugs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I had an arrangement. So, very early,I followed him to the Beta&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door and glanced at my best friend who seemed unusually nervous. It definitely wasn&#39;t a good sight for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael opened up the door, wearing nothing but a pair of black pants. His hair was messy and flopped over his eye, his face exuding drowsiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his brows furrowed when he saw Jace behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Kael, hi. How was your night?&#34; I kept my voice cheerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he wouldn&#39;t even look at me, his hardening gaze too focused on Jace. &#34;Do you need something?&#34; His tone was clipped when he finally did look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...Yes! I mean, no. I just... I wanted us to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made a disapproving grunt before attempting to shut the door in my face. I was faster and hooked my leg in-between, forcing the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kale, come on! Don&#39;t be like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anything to discuss with him,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful experiencing this arrogant side of Kael all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But it&#39;s important. Stop being so difficult!&#34; My tone grew more serious. &#34;You know, if it were him, he&#39;d have given you a chance, at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glare remained as his gaze slid between Jace and 1.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have two minutes to say whatever the fuck you wanna say and get out.&#34; He retreated into the room,leaving the door open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a deep breath as I cocked my head at Jace.&#34;Come on. Go in and make him understand,&#34; |whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed a little hesitant, but I knew it was only out of fear and doubt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, come on. He might shut this door any minute!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Fine.&#34; He pinched the bridge of his nose and finally made his way in.</p>
