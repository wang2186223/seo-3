                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I went our separate ways when we finished at the restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I got home, I was met with an unpleasant surprise. Well, not really a surprise since I knew he&#39;d be coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There in the living room was Roderick. Ex-mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been busy with his phnone, but the moment he saw me, he couldn&#39;t look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, you did come.&#34; Nora rolled her eyes, rising to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was still staring at me, seeming surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you,&#34; he suddenly muttered. &#34;From the airport.&#34; I watched Nora&#39;s body language grow uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... Roderick,&#34; she sat next to him, taking his hand. &#34;This is Lyric. She&#39;s here now. So, let&#39;s go get this over with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not miss how tense she looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick&#39;s countenance clouded with confusion. He looked at Nora like she was insane, then at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wearing a smile, I ultimately said. &#34;Hello, Roderick.It&#39;s a good thing we finally met, because I&#39;ve been as eager as you to get this over with. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned toward the door. I wasn&#39;t even going to change or anything. I was longing for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand,&#34; Roderick said, standing up.&#34;How can she be Lyric? She&#39;s...&#34; he chuckled. &#34;She can&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t born ugly, Rodrick, just in case you&#39;re forgetting. All I had to do was get rid of my scar. But,don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the same Lyric standing before you.I still remember your favorite words: &#39;Don&#39;t look at me.&#39;Your face disgusts me&#39;. &#39;Get out of my Pack&#39;.&#34; I shrugged.&#34;See? Same me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes widened like saucers. For someone as rigid as Roderick, the sight was golden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued to the door and soon opened it. But l paused when I noticed Roderick wasn&#39;t following.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have things to do, Roderick. Please, we need to get moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his gaze, seeming uncertain. Suddenly,he took his phone, tapping on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... something just came up. l-I have to go somewhere now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Roderick stuttered. But what the hell was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Babe,&#34; Nora drew close. &#34;Anything can wait. We&#39;ve been waiting for ages now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It can&#39;t wait,&#34; he nearly slapped at her. Looking at me, his gaze softened. But there was guilt in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll finish this later,&#34; he muttered and walked past me,out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Nora was displeased with Roderick&#39;s dismissal, as was I. I was more than eager to get this thing past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, I met father to tel him of my plans of returning to Draconis. As expected, he didn&#39;t take it well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You just got back, Lyric. Besides, we still have the pending agreement with Darkspire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not interested in Alpha Jaris anymore.&#34; It was difficult getting the words out, but I had to. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, father, but I really want to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing him again had brought me too much pain.I just wanted to go back to my normal life in Draconis. Father&#39;s face paled. I couldn&#39;t help feeling pity for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to say something when two guards rushed in, displaying urgency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha,&#34; they bowed to him. &#34;We have company.Alpha Jaris is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes flared wide in surprise. I wanted to believe l hadn&#39;t heard clearly, but father sprang to his feet.Shit! This was real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We scurried outside to find Jaris and tons of his men stepping out of their cars. The two men from the restaurant were also present. My jaw dropped. Why do I have a feeling he was here to cause trouble?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; Father stepped forward, delighted as he was shocked. &#34;What a pleasant surprise. You should&#39;ve told me you were coming. I&#39;d have prepared a grand welcome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; eyes found mine, and not for one second did he look away. That made me uncomfortable in a lot of ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no need for that, Alpha Bennett. I didn&#39;t come here for a grand welcome. I came here,&#34; he stepped forward. &#34;to hear directly from your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nora and her mother were out of the house, although they kept their distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, I didn&#39;t like this one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father looked at me with furrowed brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris explained. &#34;Your daughter here told me she was no longer interested.&#34; His eyes took on a shadowy gleam. &#34;I got your message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nervously licked my lower lip. &#34;Iuh...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you say it again, Lyric?&#34; He ambled toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked far too intimidating like this.I found myself retreating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think you can actually reject someone like me?&#34; I picked offense on that. Oh, so you&#39;re the only one who gets to reject people, huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, what&#39;s going on?&#34; Father turned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, there were too many eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris finally stopped coming at me, but his expression didn&#39;t get any softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You can do this, Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should stand by my words of not being interested.The problem was, it was easier saying it to his men than it was to him. Staring at that terrifyingly handsome face, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to get the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his palm and a gun was placed into it.Okay...what did he-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped when he aimed at one of father&#39;s cars and took a shot. The window glass shattered instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris! What&#39;s the meaning of this!?&#34; Father growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forgive me, Alpha Bennett, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing anything wrong. If your daughter will not honour our agreement, then I believe everything you own now belongs to me, considering the depth of your debt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot at another window.</p>
