                <p>Dread settled in my stomach as I undressed to check myself. There was no smeared cum on me or anything. It didn&#39;t &#39;look&#39; like l&#39;d been touched. But l could &#39;feel&#39; it. His arms around me. His mouth on mine.His smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was too real to be a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few minutes later, I was with the ICT guys, asking them for a footage. Well, I was their Luna, and the moment I told them that someone might have broken into my room, they didn&#39;t hesitate to give me what l wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the footage, and it came as a punch to the gut when I couldn&#39;t find anything. No one had entered my room, not even while I was at work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, was it all a dream? Was that how the pill worked?It made everything feel real?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I bathed that morning, I didn&#39;t try to pleasure myself. I already felt this deep satisfaction in my belly. This unexplainable peace.It bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had done a lot of bad things in life. Killed people for committing minor offenses, and hurt those I shouldn&#39;t have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, none had been as relieving as it was, having a taste of Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might not have used the right approach, but I didn&#39;t even care anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night was one of the best nights I have had in a while. I slept more peacefully and woke up feeling as a light as a newborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last time I felt this way was five years ago.1didn&#39;t think it was possible for any other woman to make me feel the same way Princess made me felt back then. I thought that experience was gone forever,with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the meeting I had that morning,I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about her. Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was upsetting how much space she occupied in my head, considering the fact that this lady and I are not even friends and might never be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting finished and I headed downstairs with Nerion and my assistant, we came across a mall in the complex. It wasn&#39;t the first time I was having a meeting there, neither was it the first time I was walking past that mall. But it was the first time it drew my attention. Because I spotted a dress I knew would look good on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood, my hand gently in my shirt pocket as l observed the diamond-studded dress. I imagined her in it, her hair packed into a messy bun, her eyes dark and her lips stained with red. She&#39;d look magnificent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you wish to get it for Marta?&#34; Nerion asked beside me. It was all I could do not to roll my eyes at him and ask if he&#39;d lost his mind. When have I ever gotten things for Marta myself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever she wanted to shop, I only gave her the card and let her do the rest herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from the show glass, resuming my walk out of the building with my entourage behind me. But as I did, I got an idea. The only time Lyric had gone shopping was for the mating ceremony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking out my phone, I dialed Kael who I knew was in Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael. I need you to do something for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****++****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace kept me company through the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in my room, him casually lying in my bed and talking random stuff after we just had breakfast.Someone knocked on the door, interrupting us. &#34;I&#39;ll get it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and opened the door, and on the other side was Kael. His eyes traveled past my shoulder,landing on Jace. His shoulders grew tense at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; I cleared my throat, bringing his eyes back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; Just like that, his serious expression was back. &#34;Please, dress up. I&#39;ve been asked to take you somewhere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. &#34;Can I...know where? And who asked you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris. You can dress simple. I&#39;ll wait in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was gone before I could ask any question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed the door, turning to Jace wth a look of &#39;this is what I have to go through in his hand.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He told you to dress simple. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s somewhere serious,&#34; Jace muttered, not looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes looked distant, like he was thinking about something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Kael in the car and got in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I know where we&#39;re going now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the grumpy ass still didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drove for some time and into a large shopping complex.Okay...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha wants you to shop for new dresses,&#34; Kael finally said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows shot to my hairline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay.Was he kidding me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t... understand. Why? Are we going somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;He just wants you to have them for other occasions.&#34; Getting out of the car, he opened my car door for me.I was forced to get out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I understood why he didn&#39;t tell mne about this in the pack. He knew I was likely to kick against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even come with the black card!&#34; I grumbled when it suddenly dawned on me on our way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I have a substitute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my arms crossed over my chest as we walked into the place. Two sales reps were quick to welcome me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stood back while they led me into the deeper part of the store, showing me their really pretty dresses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They looked too expensive! How many could l possibly get from here? And why was Jaris doing this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach tightened when I thought of my last dream. Him sending me on this shopping spree wasn&#39;t helping at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over an hour, I tried different dresses and ended up leaving with more than five bags. I&#39;d wanted to stop a long time ago, but Kael showed up and told the ladies to get me more until he thought it was enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was amazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thanked him in the car, a part of me excited that I actually got the clothes. They were quite pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess I&#39;d have to thank Jaris later. As hard as it&#39;d be.</p>
