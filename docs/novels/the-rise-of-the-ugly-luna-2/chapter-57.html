                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace sat next to me, his shoulders slumped in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;At least, tell me what you did, Ly. Why are these people after you? I need to understand how I can help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled a long breath. He was right. If I needed his help,he should know what I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was terrifying that I had to say this. I was letting out a very big secret, but I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Three years ago, I was in Mystopia.&#34; It was where l met Penelope and had my twins. But I didn&#39;t mention that to Jace. It wasn&#39;t important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got a job in a hospital, but I was under training and supervision. I hardly interacted with the patients there.Then, I noticed that the few times I did, the patients could easily get better.&#34; I bit my lip, hesitating for what I was to say next. &#34;One day, I stumbled upon a certain room. Before then, I&#39;d noticed that room was always locked, and not everyone could be granted access into it. But on that very day, the door was open.So,I went in and found a young man on the bed. &#34;He was asleep, his face pale. He was in a coma.&#34; I still got the chills as I remembered what it felt like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was curious to know what was wrong with him. But I also suspected that this man was someone important who the others had been hiding. I went forward-stupid me-and I-I touched him. I don&#39;t know;maybe I just wanted to know how cold or hot he was.But as soon as we made skin contact, he came awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was scared and quickly stepped back. And it was in that moment that my supervisor-Winnie-came into the room. The man went back to sleep again,looking pale like he didn&#39;t just open his eyes. My supervisor was very mad at me that day and even threatened to get me fired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the next day, she called me to her officeand asked how l&#39;d been able to pull him awake. She asked me if I could try to make him wake permanently.I wasn&#39;t sure of what I could do yet, but when she promised me a lot of money-which I needed-l agreed to give it a try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was led on what to get for the man. I held his hand much longer, and to my surprise, he did wake up. But I didn&#39;t stay for long to hear what he and my supervisor said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, feeling guilty and stupid. &#34;I don&#39;t know, but I think I made a terrible mistake, Jace. Something in me keeps screaming that that man was dangerous and was supposed to stay asleep. I don&#39;t even know how I had the power to wake him up. But...&#34;I swallowed around the lump in my throat. This was the scarier part of the story. &#34;The following day,my supervisor ended up dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still recall the fear I&#39;d felt when the news reached me that she had been killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nobody knew who was responsible, but | realized that there was trouble. I had a gut feeling it had to do with the man that was awake. So, I ran. I ran to a different city and... with my discovery of my abilities,I worked on my scar and got them removed.&#34;I shrugged. &#34;That&#39;s pretty much wvhat happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was speechless for some time. He exhaled,wiping his hands against his face and propping them in his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness, Lyric. You must&#39;ve done something really dangerous. That man was clearly a prisoner, and you just released him when he was supposed to stay imprisoned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat turned to dust. The more I realized I was wrong,the scarier it got. &#34;I-I didn&#39;t know. And when my supervisor told me to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, before she ended up dead,&#34; Jace cut me off. &#34;No wonder they&#39;re after you. They want you to pay for what you did,just like her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I buried my face in my palms, cold crushing my bones &#34;|I don&#39;t know what to do, Jace. How do I mak&lt;e them understand it wasn&#39;t intentional?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was silent for a couple of minutes. &#34;Have you...tried to understand what you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my face to look at him. &#34;I have. Apparently, we have this thing in our family where some of us are gifted with these special healing abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But don&#39;t you think yours is quite different?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was damn right. I&#39;d been concerned about that as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace chuckled before revealing the heart-shattering truth. &#34;Lyric, you&#39;re a Siphon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| d-I don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s obvious! You have this knowledge of what could work for everyone, and the healing process occurs only completely when you make contact with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t agree any less. The first instinct in me when I see a sick person is to touch them. I always had this feeling that they&#39;d be better as soon as I touch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not healing them through the normal way you know. You&#39;re siphoning their sicknesses from their body to yours. Only difference is, your body has been made for things like this. So, you don&#39;t feel it.&#34; He stood up,lifting and falling his hands. &#34;Do you fucking know how special that is? We haven&#39;t seen a Siphon in hundreds of years!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach churned with dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. It couldn&#39;t be. I loved being different, but not Siphon-kind of different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;J-Jace, what do l do?&#34; A tremor ran through my quiet voice as I stood up. I&#39;d never been more scared in a long time. &#34;I can&#39;t be a Siphon. I don&#39;t want to be!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, girlfriend.&#34; Jace shook his head. There was no fun in his eyes. Just worry for me. &#34;You already are.And the Executioners already know, which is the reason they&#39;re going all out to hunt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Siphons were more of a curse than a blessing in our world. They were forbidden, and every Siphon that had been born in the past was always killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do realize how dangerous you are, don&#39;t you?&#34;Jace took my hands. &#34;You could hurt people, Ly.Destroy people. You can siphon so much, not justa person&#39;s sickness.&#34; He looked down at our hands joined together. &#34;If you focus, you can actually siphon oxygen out of me and I&#39;ll drop dead. You can siphon emotions, my reasoning, and even my memory!&#34; He huffed, shaking his head. &#34;Your kind has always been forbidden because you could do things that aren&#39;t allowed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I didn&#39;t ask to be this!&#34; My voice was filled with agony. &#34;I don&#39;t want to be this, Jace. I don&#39;t want to be this dangerous to people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my head, a tear slipping down. &#34;I&#39;m so scared,Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; he cooed, coming closer and taking my hands again. &#34;I know you, Ly. You&#39;re the sweetest defenseless girl I know. You won&#39;t want to hurt anyone.That&#39;s how I know you&#39;ve got this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tears streaked down my cheeks as I looked at him. &#34;But if the others get to know... I&#39;ll be dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won&#39;t. I won&#39;t let that happen.&#34; He squeezed my hands. &#34;We&#39;ll both protect this secret with our lives,and I&#39;ll make sure no harm comes to you.&#34;</p>
