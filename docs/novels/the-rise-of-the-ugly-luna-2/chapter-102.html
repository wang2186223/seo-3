                <p>I thought the guard was joking or wrong. Jaris was here? What was he doing here? I knew there was no way he&#39;d be looking for me. He should be more than happy that I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the guard to the living room, and to my surprise, Jaris was there, Kael and Nerion top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father was standing beside Jaris, and they all looked at me as I walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Maybe he&#39;s here to terminate the contract.That&#39;d be the best news I&#39;d have heard in years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, I didn&#39;t want him here. I didn&#39;t even want to see him. Seeing him only brought back painful memories of what he&#39;d done to me the previous night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even bother to greet him as I stood with them,making sure to keep my distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris is looking for you,&#34; Father said,surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him but didn&#39;t say a word. I noticed he&#39;d been staring at me since I came into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to speak with her alone, if you don&#39;t mind,&#34; Jaris said to those around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; My voice was firm. &#34;Whatever you have to say you can say it now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the good things that&#39;s happened with Jaris and I for the past few weeks, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be so cold toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was furious. He hurt me and I didn&#39;t want him around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me with surprise, clearly not expecting I&#39;d to say that in front of all these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice turned colder when he spoke again. &#34;I asked to have the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If they leave, I&#39;m leaving, Alpha Jaris.&#34; I made sure to include sarcasm in the way I called his name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the glint in his eyes. He was getting pissed.But above all, he looked hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Too bad I didn&#39;t care right now. I was beyond hurt last night. I was shattered. And why was he even here like he cared?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Since you want to do this here.&#34; He tucked his hand into his pocket. &#34;Why are you here?&#34; I shrugged. &#34;Maybe because you asked me to leave.You told me to sleep with other men. And since I didn&#39;t hnave any, I decided to come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surprise in Jaris&#39; face was unmistakable. He probably didn&#39;t expect me to reveal that in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all looked at me in shock, father&#39;s own being the most obvious. Well, I didn&#39;t have any intention of hiding it. They should all know what Jaris was doing to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get your things. We&#39;re going home.&#34; Jaris started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was clearly pissed. Very pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere with you.&#34; My words stopped him at the door. &#34;I&#39;m staying here, Alpha Jaris. For now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at him, I wanted to cry right now. He may not have said the word, but he called me a slut last night.He made me feel so ashamed of myself, for even loving him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His jaw ticked as he turned around to face me.&#34;What did you say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to remain strong. He looked intimidating right now, but this wasn&#39;t the time to cower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I&#39;m not going with you. I&#39;m staying here for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For how long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t know. I just know that I don&#39;t want to be near you. Or that place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain flickered across his eyes. But a second later, it was gone,replaced by hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to be forgetting that we had an agreement, Lyric Harper. As much as you&#39;d want to do what your silly head wants, we have a contract binding us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m pretty sure the contract doesn&#39;t include you calling me names and asking me to go sleep around.&#34;I tried to sound and look nonchalant, but only I knew how hurt I was. How I was shaking inside. &#34;Right noW,Alpha Jaris, I don&#39;t really care about the contract. The only way I&#39;m leaving here is if you ask them-&#34; | tipped my head toward Kael and Nerion. &#34;-to drag me out of here. They&#39;d have to humiliate me. But it&#39;s fine. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time you&#39;d be hurting or humiliating me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyelids stung with the heat of unshed tears. But l couldn&#39;t let them fall. I couldn&#39;t let him see how broken | was. I turned on my heel and hurried away, going up the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was finally some good news for the Monroes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta happily went home when her mother called and told her they&#39;d found Penelope, the woman they&#39;d gotten the kids from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the house and found the tall fine woman sitting on the couch with her head high,looking like she was the boss among them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was just like Marta remembered. She&#39;d always had that bossy nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are you here? I thought you were far from here or something?&#34; She asked the question that&#39;d been on her mind since her mother told her they found her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could ask you the same thing. I didn&#39;t know this was the country you resided in,&#34; the woman said with slight arrogance in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here on a mission?&#34; Marta stepped toward her.&#34;Are you here to ruin things for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please. You wouldn&#39;t have seen me had your family not been looking for me. Besides, I was born here. I only traveled out on business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, drop it. This isn&#39;t the reason we looked for her,&#34;her grandmother scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped arguing but kept her suspicious eyes on the woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope, where did you get the kids from?&#34; Her grandmother asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now it was Penelope&#39;s turn to look suspicious.&#34;Why are you asking? We all agreed the mother&#39;s identity would stay with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, there&#39;s a lot at stake, okay? Because those kids themed out to actually belong to the man I bought them for.&#34; Marta snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Penelope&#39;s bossy face was crumpled in a frown. &#34;How&#39;s that possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. That&#39;s the reason you&#39;re here. How did the kids turn out to be his? Who&#39;s their mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Well, it was just a random ugly girl.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What ugly girl?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know her. I only met her on the streets,heavily pregnant, and took her in. You&#39;d already contacted me for a child before then. I found out she was carrying a set of twins and you were excited when I told you about it. You said the more the better.I took the babies from her when they were born, and it was the last time I saw her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta scoffed, batting her lashes. &#34;So, are you trying to say my man got an ugly girl pregnant? He can&#39;t even get me pregnant! I had to lie about the whole thing and was glad he fell for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s this girl? Do you have pictures of her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope reached for her phone, operated it for sometime before showing the screen to Marta&#39;s mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rushed over to join them in watching the pictures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eww! She&#39;s really ugly!&#34; Her mother made a face of disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s that ugly scar?&#34;</p>
