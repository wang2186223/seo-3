                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must sense my fear because he smirked. &#34;Calm down, will you? I just want to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against the wall, crossing his arms like this was a normal conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember those times you were upset that I hadn&#39;t taken you to bed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped hard at his question. Why was he bringing it up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of letting him rule the conversation with my fear,I forced myself to play strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. You mean all those times you&#39;d bring different women home and make me listen to their moans?Sure,I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. Like this was funny to him?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just wanted to say I&#39;m sorry, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;Sorry for what? For not wanting to have sex with me because | was too ugly to be looked at?&#34; &#34;Well, you can&#39;t blame me, can you? Your face was nothing to write home about, Lyric. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t have wanted to be with me if I were ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head at his shallow mindedness. The asshole actually thought everything was about looks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I wish I could turn back the hands of time,&#34;he shifted from the wall. &#34;I&#39;d have made you feel the best kind of things in bed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Roderick. Cut it. Don&#39;t flatter yourself,thinking you&#39;re actually that impressive in bed.I mean,definitely, you must&#39;ve known those moans were faked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile slipped. Seeing that I&#39;ve hit a sensitive spot,I continued. &#34;You should be good at this. You should know when moans are being faked or real. Unless,sadly, you&#39;ve never heard real moans before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One day, you slapped one of your bitches when she didn&#39;t even moan at all. It wasn&#39;t until you threatened her that she got into the role and started bringing out her cries.&#34; It was my turn to smirk. &#34;I heard it, Roderick.It was quite shameful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I got Roderick Fletcher where it really hurt.Because right now, there was no trace of a smile on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of my room, Roderick. Or better still,&#34; I grabbed my bag. &#34;I&#39;m done here. So you can have the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I reached the door and tired to open it, he roughly grabbed my arm. It was so rough it made me wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think they fake their moans, huh?&#34; He taunted.&#34;Well, bear this in mind, sweet Lyric, sooner than you think, I&#39;m going to fuck that cunt of yours. Then,you&#39;ll tell me if those moans are being faked or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I felt was repulsion and the need to break his nose.But I knew that&#39;d be impossible with someone like Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go, asshole!&#34; I jerked my hand free. &#34;Don&#39;t ever touch me again. Ever!&#34; I spat at him before rushing out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt better by the time I drove back to Darkspire. To hell with Roderick and his stupid words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help the feeling of calm that hit me as |stepped out of my car. I miss being here. I wouldn&#39;t even deny it. The guards and servants dipped their heads at me as l made my way in. The first room I went to wasn&#39;t even mine,no. It was the one room I&#39;d missed the most in the entire Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty Lyric!&#34; The adorable twins jumped on me the second I opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey pumpkins!!! Which of you missed me?!&#34; I pulled them into my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,it was me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I missed you more,aunty Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While | was away, they kept calling and asking when I&#39;d be back. I missed them so much and felt bad that l was away from them. But I was too angry at Jaris to come back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been? Ooh, you&#39;re trying on new dresses!&#34; I stepped back to admire what they had on.Goodness,they looked magnificent!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their designer was by the side of the room,smiling at uS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s our birthday outfit. What do you think,aunty Lyric?&#34;Xyla beamed. &#34;Hmm. What do I think?&#34; I placed my index finger under my chin like I was really thinking. &#34;I&#39;d say you&#39;re the cutest kids I&#39;ve ever seen. Trust me, if any other kids were to try on these clothes, they wouldn&#39;t look as good as you two right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They giggled. Oh, such cute sounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent some more time with them, discussing how the preparations for their birthday was going. It was just five days from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way to my room, I found Kael coming. He was wearing a suit-which was a very rare sight. So, 1remembered he was supposed to have dinner with Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ho, Kael. How did your dinner go?&#34; I asked with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look surprised that I knew. Of course, Jace and I were best friends. He should know he&#39;d tell me everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But | didn&#39;t miss the sadness in his eyes. &#34;It was okay.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No,it wasn&#39;t. Everything about his tone said that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew he wouldn&#39;t want to talk about it with me.I&#39;d just ask Jace on my own. I proceeded to my room-gods, I missed it-showered and changed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of the mirror, wearing my pyjamas as I stared down at the pack in my hands. For several minutes,I&#39;d been this way-conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was away in Father&#39;s pack, I missed so many things about Darkspire. The people, the kids, and no doubt,Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I missed the dreams I had of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now, staring at the pills in my hands, despite the temptation, they felt so wrong to consider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do this. I couldn&#39;t continue letting a stupid dream detect my nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris made me feel like a slut. And what if I was by always having sex dreams of him? What did that make me,huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sniffling, I put the pills back into my drawer and simply laid in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock broke the quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got the door and my heart that did skip thingy when I found Jaris in front of me.</p>
