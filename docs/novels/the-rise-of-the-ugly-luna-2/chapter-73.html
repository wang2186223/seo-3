                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you tied?&#34; | went closer to the girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been this way for as long as I can remember,my king. I have been in captivity for so long I have grown accustomed to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the wall. &#34;My king, the clock is ticking.&#34; Her voice was filled with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t even glance at it. Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More of the Chairman&#39;s words came to mind.&#39;this is a trial for the wisest minds. It is to see how right you think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;you&#39;re to see yourselves as the Alpha King. Think as one. Act like one&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was the Alpha King. The girl before him was one of his people. She had been in captivity for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kind of a king would I be if I abandoned her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped to one knee, grabbed her hand and started undoing the ropes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could easily tear the ropes apart with my Alpha strength, but one of the rules said not to use our powers in any form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl gasped, her eyes going wide with shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My King! You&#39;ll never be able to meet up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the clock. Just ten seconds left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rope was too tight. But I didn&#39;t give up. I kept trying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was all a test. It was the people&#39;s responsibility to be concerned for their klng, which was the reason the girl was worried about the time. But it was my duty as their king to be more concerned about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept glancing at the clock. The seconds were going down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally fred the ropes, but it came off the same time the alarm went off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My time was up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t meet up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My enthusiasm waned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, my king,&#34; the girl muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained on her knees, her head bowed, her palms showing me the key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, I took it from her, opened the door and stepped out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was greeted with a sight I did not expect. Not with what I&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were cheers and applauses, and these tiny ribbons floating in the air. I froze at the door,confused and wondering if they were celebrating my failure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca walked up to me, holding a lanyard that clearly read &#39;1st Trial Done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone like me who was hardly ever confused,this got me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Alpha Jaris. You made it,&#34; Luca beamed and wore the lanyard over my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; I gave him a questioning look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman walked up to me. &#34;We never mentioned that the end aim of the trial is to make it out of the rooms in time. We only told you you had fifteen minutes. Didn&#39;t mean if you hadn&#39;t made it before fifteen minutes, you&#39;d have lost. It was a trail for the wisest minds. We wanted to see how you&#39;d act as a King when you happen upon your people in trouble, even if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.&#34;He dipped his head. &#34;Congratulations, Alpha Jaris.You made it to the second round.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold relief washed over me, as well as astonishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These men were something else. Tricky as fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down at the lanyard with renewed pride.So,I made it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobbing my head, I made my way to my seat,next to a smiling Lyric. It dawned on me that she was happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Alpha,&#34; she muttered in the faintest of voices, as though she was shy saying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funnily creepy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply inclined my head at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Roderick&#39;s seat. He wasn&#39;t there, neither was his partner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps, I should&#39;ve found a way not to come to this trial at all. Because my stupid heart wouldn&#39;t stop beating since | watched Jaris on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been so nervous for him as I watched him through the cameras. He was the third Alpha to have won so far,five failing before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trial was quite challenging. Some of the Alphas didn&#39;t even make it to the tenth room to see the final task. Some that did-like Roderick -was too time-conscious to care about the girl on her knees. They just grabbed the key and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick had almost caused a fight when he was told he didn&#39;t pass the trial. He yelled about being tricked and not specifically told to save anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He utterly embarrassed himself in front of everyone and stormed out of the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,typical Roderick. Always caring only for himself.It would be a disaster to have someone like him as the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Jaris execute wisdom and escaping all the rooms was mind-blowing. Now, my heart won&#39;t stop fluttering since he made it out of the final room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d always known he was smart. But Jaris was not entirely kind. So, seeing him help the girl on her knees only proved how very/intelligent he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And well, what could I say? Women love intelligent men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Too bad there isn&#39;t a world where you two exist,Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trial went on for the two remaining Alphas. Alpha Zarek passed, while the last Alpha failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That made four winners and six losers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall erupted into cheers-coming from the members of the Alphas that had won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A meeting was called for them and I had to accompany Jaris. In a separate room, the Alphas were addressed by the Chairman and representatives. A new date was announced for the second trial, and enough luck was dished out to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught Alpha Zarek staring at me, mutiple times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it wasn&#39;t carnal. Instead, he gave me that guilty look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t exactly get what his problem was. If he had something to say, why couldn&#39;t he just spit it out already?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt nervous sitting next to Jaris during the ride home.If we were on good terms, I&#39;d have given him a hug for his awesome performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was a rude jerk who might probably snap at me for even thinking of doing that to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching Darkspire, we met a huge welcome party.Judging by Jaris&#39; reaction, he didn&#39;t know about this.The members must have planned it ahead in anticipation for his win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A red carpet was placed on the floor beneath the car doors where Jaris and I was supposed to step out from.They opened the door for us and we stepped out the same time, him from the left, and me from the right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They shouted and clapped and threw RIBBONS in the air as we alighted. I laughed heartily, finding the whole show just adorable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They weren&#39;t just celebrating Jaris. They were celebrating me as his Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde was the first to walk up to us. She hugged Jaris and kissed him on the cheek.&#34;Congratulations, son. You were amazing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris simply nodded before pulling away from her hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Next came the kids, and Marta behind them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy! I heard you won!&#34; Xyla with the loudest voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yes, darling. I did.&#34; Jaris carried them both in his arms, then planted a kiss on both their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More people came to congratulate him. Walking on the red carpet, we were led to the large party hall.</p>
