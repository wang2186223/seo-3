                <p>JACE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace adjusted in his seat. This was the real deal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to help me move into Darkspire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Kael hadn&#39;t swallowed the drink he had in his mouth already,he&#39;d have spilled it all over the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wouldn&#39;t have been as shocked if Jace had told him he wanted to take down a certain Alpha. But moving in to Darkspire? To a different Pack? It was beyond ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Jace, it was very important. He was worried about Lyric and someone discovering her secret.He took the night they were supposed to elope as an instance.She had been caught and locked up by Jaris, yet he had no idea.If something bad were to happen to her while he was far away,he wouldn&#39;t have any idea until it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed to be close to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, tell me you&#39;re drunk,&#34; Kael scoffed. &#34;That&#39;s the only reasonable explanation for this madness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t invite you here to drink from my glass if | wasn&#39;t serious. I&#39;m damn serious about this, Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you sound crazy. I&#39;m not letting you into Darkspire. That&#39;s not possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Jace leaned closer to the seat. &#34;According to the laws of our Packs, a Pack is required to receive guests at anytime. Not accepting me would be discrimination and breaking the rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A Pack is required to receive guests who are important and have a valid reason to be there.What is your reason,tell me. To stay close to the Alpha&#39;s mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; Jace rubbed his hand against his face. &#34;Believe me,Kael. Lyric and I could never be anything beyond friends. She&#39;s like a sister to me. And believe me,if l wanted her before Jaris did, I&#39;d have gotten her. She doesn&#39;t want me either. As a matter of fact,&#34; he sighed, his face growing serious. &#34;Lyric has never crossed my mind in that light.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael gave him one of his cold assessing looks. It was a look Jace hated, but it also meant he was confident his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, let&#39;s assume you&#39;re telling the truth,&#34; he drank from his glass again. &#34;I can&#39;t get you into Darkspire.You need to have a solid reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, this is important. Lyric... she&#39;s been getting into a lot of trouble lately and needs ms around to &#34;As much as I want to admire how protective you are as her friend, you still need a valid reason to come to Darkspire. Alpha Jaris won&#39;t approve of it unless it makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, let&#39;s come up with one. Because l fucking need this to happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十米米来米十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a new day. Yet, it came with the same burden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked pale in the mirror, staring at my reflection wearing black corporate pants with a black top tucked into it, and my new favorite red lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I&#39;d have looked stunning if I didn&#39;t look so sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my dresser was my phone with the text clearly displayed:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were expecting you yesterday, Mrs. Dreadmoor.We hope we get to see you today. Please, do get back to us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I discovered who I really was,I&#39;d been troubled and contemplated quitting my new job at TCH or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was right. I needed to stop using my powers for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what I&#39;d been able to do was so good. I got to give life to a man who didn&#39;t have much hope.I wished I could continue doing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,last night, I concluded on one thing-I didn&#39;t need to use my powers to do good. I could simply heal them with my basic knowledge and help them get better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing my things, I headed for my car, hit the road and drove to Botanical Bliss first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, I got a pair of abyssal gloves. It was made for similar purposes-very thick and creating a barrier between my hands and the other person&#39;s skin. This way, I won&#39;t be siphoning anybody&#39;s powers when l touch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful that I had to keep this side of me locked,but it was for the best. The only person I had to take care of was Xylon, and everything would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached TCH and headed to Guinevere&#39;s office. The woman was on a phone call when I entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. You&#39;re here.&#34; She dropped the landline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, ma&#39;am.&#34; I dipped my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite late, I must say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I know, and I&#39;m so sorry. Certain things came up.I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re here. Today,&#34; she stood up. &#34;I&#39;ll be needing you to attend to a very delicate case. This man is an old time and has done a lot of good in our world. Unfortunately, he was poisoned with Kaltis, resulting in a failed heart. He is quite old,hence not healing quickly. I know you just resumed,but I have this great confidence that you can do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, my heart beating painfully in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I can do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I can. If I wasn&#39;t trying to hide my true self,it&#39;d have been a piece of cake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled to Guinevere, anyway. &#34;Okay, ma&#39;am.&#34; Even though I knew it was a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Come, dear. I&#39;ll show you to your office.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell that Guinevere was a very strict woman,yet she&#39;s been friendly with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took me to my office which was qute big,well furnished with proper lightings, and very beautiful. My heart melted at the name tab on the table. &#39;Dr. Lyric.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a doctor. Oh, damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile spread across my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the landline over there, and there&#39;s a book containing the various codes. You let me know if you need anything. Starting today, you&#39;ll be getting a schedule on the patients you&#39;re to attend to. I wish you the best of luck, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dipped my head. &#34;Thank you, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, it&#39;s Dr. Guinevere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks flushed as I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be taking you to your first patient by one p.m.For now just stay settled in your office.&#34; Guinevere reached the door but suddenly slept when she remembered something. &#34;And oh, there&#39;s someone that wishes to see you, Dr.Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thirty minutes later, the &#39;someone&#39; did come. It felt good receiving a visitor for the first time in &#39;my&#39; office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my happiness fell flat when the visitor turned out to be Alpha Zarek. Relief and anger crushed through me at once. Relief because I&#39;d been trying to reach him for days and failing. Anger because he and Marta probably knew something I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; He wore a small smile as he strode into the office,taking a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Zarek,&#34; I cleared my throat. &#34;What an unexpected visit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked around my office, as of accessing it. &#34;Nice place. And congrats on the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored it. &#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;ve been wanting to meet you for days nowN.I was told it was you who helped my father get better and I wanted to personally thank you for it. You did a good job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I did was nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| also wanted to ask, is there something you&#39;d need for-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it for a favour,&#34;. I cut him off, already knowing where he was headed. &#34;But yes, maybe there&#39;s something you could dofor me.&#34; Thank goodness the idea struck my mind.</p>

                <p>&#34;On the ninth of this month, Marta and I were in a Garden, having a discussion then, she left and I passed out from my drink. But I noticed you came into that same garden while I was still in. Do you mind explaining to me what you were doing there?&#34;</p>
