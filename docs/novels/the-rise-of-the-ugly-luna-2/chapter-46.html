                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a party tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the top ranking Alphas was celebrating his birthday. It was going to be a mega party and of course, very fun. But for the past few days, since the news of it circulated, I&#39;d been trying to push it behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until Jace and I were on a phone call this evening and he had to remind me of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you wearing to the party? You need to dress to kill. It&#39;s a game of who looks the finest, Lyric.&#34; He gleamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, I know. This was one reason I never attended such parties years back. The pressure was often too much,and well, with the scar on my face, I never truly fit in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going.&#34; I lowered my eyes as my countenance dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I said nothing, he realized. &#34;Shit. Jaris hasn&#39;t asked you yet, has he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to our contract, I was supposed to accompany him to such events. But considering the fact that we haven&#39;t spoken to each other since we got mated, I wasn&#39;t so sure anymore. Although, I&#39;d have really loved to go with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter. You can still come on your own,Ly.I can come get you if you want,&#34; Jace suggested but I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just felt it&#39;d be weird if I had to show up to such an event without my new mate. And I was almost sure Jaris would be going. Wouldn&#39;t it be wrong if we went separately?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace spent the remaining minutes of our call trying to talk me into going alone. But in the end,I refused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, I made my way to my closet and smiled wistfully as I stared at the fine green dress standing in the middle of the room. I felt a pang of sadness as I ran my finger through the rich stoned fabric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d gotten it on the day I was buying my ceremonial dress. I&#39;d hoped to wear it on my first official outing with Jaris, just like tonight. I wanted to make a good impression by his side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But apparently, it was useless. *****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me hours to get back to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite what I&#39;d achieved today, despite knowing that Zarek had lost his chance at winning, I was far from satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to my room to have a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands against the wall, I felt that familiar sense of unease I&#39;d been feeling for the past one week. It traveled all the way to my cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut my eyes and tried to resist it. I tried to push the memory into a dark corner of my mind. But no matter how hard I tried, it kept coming back like a storm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was frustrated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, in the end, I had no choice but to give in to the demand. My hand rose to my erection, jerking at the image of a certain woman, wet and naked. A woman l should have no business thinking about. A woman l hated that I was thinking about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me angry as much as it brought me pleasure.And in a few minutes, I came done in my hand,my release dropping to the floor. I&#39;ll admit-the feeling was always euphoric. The best kind of feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But after I climbed down from my high, the weight of my actions dawned on me-like always. I suddenly hated myself for being hard and coming to the mere erotic image of someone that had betrayed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was even more infuriating? I wanted more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the fourth time I was cuming to her image in the bathroom, and each time, it left me wanting more.Wanting more than the pleasure my hands provided.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I detested it, but my will seemed to be useless against the matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who the hell was this witch?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angrily I finished my shower and returned to the room to get dressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pissed now and couldn&#39;t even sleep. So, I thought of distracting myself with some letters and documents in my home office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was deep into it when someone knocked,sparking my irritation for distracting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s it?&#34; I rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened slowly, followed by the face of the one woman I didn&#39;t want to lay eyes on right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers tightened around my pen as I did all I could to keep my anger at bay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked in, wearing a black short that stopped above her knee, and a mesh top on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was up in a tight ponytail, her lips colored with a nude lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked simple yet undeniably alluring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyes to the papers in front of me,refusing to acknowledge that thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; The words came out clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell she was nervous. And her eyes looked sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um.... Good evening, Alpha Jaris.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the tremor in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she so afraid? She&#39;d never been afraid to disobey me. She wasn&#39;t afraid when she slept with Zarek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| lifted my eyes to her, starting from her legs. imagined Zarek running his dirty hands up those legs. I imagined him touching what he was never supposed to touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had kissed him so passionately in the video. The video was muted, but I had seen her lips moving They&#39;d been talking. I didn&#39;t want to imagine the filthy words she must&#39;ve been saying to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought she could be different. I thought she was decent. But she was cheap. Disappointingly so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want, Lyric?&#34; I needed her to leave as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hostility in my voice must affect her,because l could see the slight recoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I um... I just wanted to ask about the party. Alpha Rhys&#39; party. From the contract, you mentioned me accompanying me to such events. But you haven&#39;t said anything. So...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she went on speaking, I kept trying to picture what stupid hold she had over me. Why couldn&#39;t I get her out of my head?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even now, the reason I desperately wanted her gone was because she was distracting me.Hearing her speak, all I wanted to do was haul her to the wall,rip off her clothes and fuck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I shouldn&#39;t want that. I hated this woman for what she did to me. I shouldn&#39;t desire her this way. So,what was this stupid pull that kept drawing me to her?</p>
