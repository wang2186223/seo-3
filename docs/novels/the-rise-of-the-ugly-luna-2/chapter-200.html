                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands balled into fists beside me. By the gods, I wanted to take her pride away. Just... anything to bring her from this throne a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew there was nothing I could do. Plus with my baby involved, I wasn&#39;t ready to get into another fight with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how hard it was bowing to the woman who&#39;s made me her enemy from the very first day she saw me and ensured that life was always difficult for me,l forced my head to go low, giving her the glory she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t see her face, but I could somehow tell she was smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can hear your words,&#34; she taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat burnt from trying to produce the words,but I forced them out nonetheless. &#34;Grand Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; She stepped back, a hand on her thigh.&#34;Sounds much better. Who would&#39;ve thought that seeing you like this would be such a fulfilling sight?&#34; I raised my head as, my cheeks burning in shame. Her smug smile made me hate myself even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re finally learning your place.Now, this brings me to the question I&#39;ve been curious to ask for a long time. How have you been a Siphon but managed to hide it from everyone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my mouth shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, now it makes sense,&#34; she nodded, like someone just discovering a golden truth. &#34;Why you always seemed perfect and untouchable. Even at TCH,you made it seem like the rest of us were being useless. So, it wasn&#39;t just you. It had to do with your witch powers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not a witch,&#34; I rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like hell you&#39;re not,&#34; she huffed. &#34;Your kind is forbidden. I honestly don&#39;t know why my &#39;husband&#39; is defending you.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the way she laid emphasis on &#39;husband&#39;. She was really out to get me.&#34;But I&#39;m sure soon, he&#39;ll come to his senses. When everyone stands against him on his decision to keep you safe,he&#39;ll hand you over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came closer to me, her eyes gleaming with pride.&#34;I cannot wait for the day you get executed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I scoffed, mocking her. &#34;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll be waiting for a long time, then. Who knows? You might probably even die before me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark flashed in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Marta. That&#39;s enough,&#34; someone said from behind,cutting whatever retort she was about to spew at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced behind and found Maddy coming towards us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rolled her eyes. &#34;No one invited you into this conversation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need to boe invited. Your messy attitude is already enough. And please, don&#39;t start with the whole &#39;grand Luna&#39;s shit with me. You should knowI&#39;m not working with that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta zeroed her eyes on me. &#34;Stay away from my kids.I mean it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked away, feeling me with relief I didn&#39;t know I needed. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing Maddy, I felt a little uncomfortable. We haven&#39;t spoken since I was known to be a Siphon.Over the month, she&#39;s turned out to be a great friend,but I didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d feel about this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; She asked, making me want to cry. &#34;Y-Yeah,I guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. I&#39;ll help you pack up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told her I was on my way to get food. So, she followed me to the restaurant instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turned out that Maddy didn&#39;t have a problem with me being what I was. According to her, l&#39;ve always been a sweet soul and she wasn&#39;t going to judge me for something I didn&#39;t choose to be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finished from the restaurant and returned to the room, I was surprised to find Nerion leaving.Maddy grew uncomfortable at once at the sight of him while he also seemed to tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was he doing in my room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His Highness asked me to check on you,&#34; he clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Maddy and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were getting rougher on this side. I&#39;d been gettingendless letters from the Elders and Alphas, demanding answers regarding Lyric being pardoned when she was a Siphon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was truly becoming frustrating, and I didn&#39;t know how to proceed any further without wanting to get someone punished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why didn&#39;t they have to worry about it? Why couldn&#39;t they just trust my decision and believe that she was someone that was never going to hurt anyone? She was my mate, pregnant with my child, and I was fucking in love with her! Wasn&#39;t that enough reason for anyone to just let me be?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael walked in just when I was about shredding the last letter to pieces. He gave me a disapproving stare like he knew what I was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll need to find a permanent solution to that,you know?&#34; He said it like it wasn&#39;t obvious. &#34;Things are not looking funny anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want?&#34; | rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damm it, Jaris. Now I was starting to pour out my frustration on everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You.... sent for me?&#34; He scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,right. I forgot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to do something. I need you to check on Velvet Sky Lodge.&#34; It was one of my hotels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a picture of all the staff that had been on duty that morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d gotten them before when I questioned them on the lady&#39;s disappearance from the hotel. They all claimed not to know why she left, and I believed them.Now, it looks like one of them had been lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric and I had more time to talk last night, and she explained that one of the staff had deceived her into leaving, making her think I ordered it. I never gave such an order, but apparently it was the reason we had been separated for six years. She had to live for six years thinking l used and abandoned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I could get my hand on that very staff, there was no telling what I&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a reason you want it now?&#34; Kael asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Can&#39;t talk about it now.&#34; I grabbed the next letter which I was already sure would piss me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas and Elders sure knew what they were doing. If the letters got to a certain amount, I&#39;d really have to answer to them. And by the look of things, it was very close to that amount. &#34;Got you. Do you need help with anything else?&#34; My Beta asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared intently at the papers on my desk as an idea settled in my mind. The situation was trying to get out of hand. I&#39;d really need to do something about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; I looked up at Kael. &#34;There is something you could help me with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just finished from a brief meeting with some of the locals of a Pack where a major issue had to be addressed and was heading to my office when I saw Nerion. My heart beamed with delight at the realization that Lyric was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did it go?&#34; I asked as soon as I met up with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was good, boss. Everyone&#39;s in the Central Pack already. Your things are there as well. Everyone&#39;s waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sounded so relieving. I couldn&#39;t wait to move into a real home and have some rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; |asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good as well. She&#39;s in the Central Pack. Jace and Maddy are keeping her company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... There&#39;s something you should know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped walking as soon as he said that. Somehow,I knew it had to do with Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While uh... Lyric was packing up,&#34; he glanced around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Spit it out, Kael. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just...there was a point when I entered her room to check on her, and she wasn&#39;t there. I was about to leave, then I noticed something in an open drawer.I know... I know I shouldn&#39;t have pried into her privacy,but with the nature of my job, you know I&#39;m always curious. So,I went closer, and I saw this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped his phone a few times and showed me a picture on it-one that wasn&#39;t quite clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s an ultrasound image. Looks like that of twins.&#34;</p>
