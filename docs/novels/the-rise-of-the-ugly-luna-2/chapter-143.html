                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I passed out and couldn&#39;t even tell for how long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I knew was, after the call with Jaris, Caden still beat me some more, just for the sake of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became too much to handle that I passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 didn&#39;t even know how he managed to bring me awake just now, but I sure didn&#39;t want to stay conscious. It made me aware of the pains and the fact that I was between life and death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feeling better?&#34; Caden asked with a smirk, his face in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stomach churned at the sight of him. Gods, I hated this man. He was a monster who deserved to rot in hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, however, I was at his mercy. I wanted to beg him some more to let me go, but my mouth wouldn&#39;t open.My eyes could barely stay open either. The pain was unbearable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re done here. One of my people will take you to the drop off location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so relieved I wanted to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This...this was over? I wasn&#39;t going to die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you wouldn&#39;t mind delivering a message to Jaris, would you?&#34; His finger came to my cheek, caressing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have the option of accepting or refusing. He gave me the message.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head fell forward as I struggled at the brink of consciousness. I didn&#39;t know what happened next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt hands on mine, the ropes being fred, I felt myself moving. But not once did I open my eyes to see what was happening. It was a miracle I was actually still alive. ＊＊＊＊十十＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of the usual forty minutes, we arrived Darkspire in thirty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept threatening Razi to move the jet at its fastest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion had already arranged for enough of our men to wait in a particular spot. So, we didn&#39;t reach the pack when we arrived Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was frustrating that I didn&#39;t even know where to start looking. I knew there was no way Lyric would&#39;ve been kidnapped in Darkspire. She was probably on her way somewhere. Or perhaps, was she blackmailed to come out or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started by checking the roads leading out of Darkspire and found broken glasses on the ground. That was our first clue. She must&#39;ve been driving and was attacked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were trying to check for tire trails when my phone beeped with a new test. My chest tightened when l realized it was from her number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened it in a hurry and found a location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t pause to think. We made our way to the place, cars and vans filling the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept staring at Nerion&#39;s hands and legs on the steering and pedals, wondering if he was moving fast enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step on it!&#34; I rasped. But there wasn&#39;t much he could do. He was going at a very high speed already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to be there at the location like I needed my next breath. Right now, I could very much be walking into a trap, yet I didn&#39;t fucking care. Not when there was even the slightest chance that I migh see Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived, I didn&#39;t even wait for the car to fully stop before I was running out of it. For a man like myself who&#39;s always been comnposed, tonight was a very shitty one for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>found her carby the side of the street. It was broken like it had been in an accident. The men got to it before I did and opened the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to pull her out. Quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those were the words I heard that brought me crushing relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They found her. She was in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,the relief was short-lived when I reached the door and found the sight of the &#39;lady&#39; in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Lyric. But for a moment, I couldn&#39;t recognize her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took the familiar torn shirts to know she was the one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight before me....it wasn&#39;t one I ever thought I&#39;d see on Lyric. Her eyes were swollen shut, her lips . broken and swollen, her clothes torn with bruises all over the exposed skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even a wild animal wouldn&#39;t do this to you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with disbelief as the men managed to pull her out of the car. She wasn&#39;t even conscious.How could she be when she looked like she was dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched emotionlessly as they took her to the van. Yes, it was emotionless because | didn&#39;t know how to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This...this was all strange to me. Lyric had gone through hell, because of me. And I didn&#39;t know how to feel about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rock formed in my throat, making it impossible for me to say my next order to Kael. I wanted to tell him to get her from the men&#39;s van and bring her to our own car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew they took her there because there was more space and she&#39;d be comfortable, but I didn&#39;t care.I wanted her with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, when I realized I couldn&#39;t speak, I had to do it myself. I walked to the van, got past the men who easily stepped away for me and grabbed Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; I muttered under my breath when I held her to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every part of her body was covered with claw marks and dried blood. These were Caden&#39;s claws.I didn&#39;t want to imagine how excruciating they must be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was hesitant about holding her, fearing that my hands only make the wounds hurt more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes traveled to her ripped jeans and cold rage poured into my bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.I refused to think of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying her in my arms, I walked back to my car and placed her in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car was on the road again in a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even look around to know if everything was fine. Wasn&#39;t concerned about anything else around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only person that had my undivided attention was the torn woman before me. I kept my eyes on her and didn&#39;t dare look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was in pain. And it was because of the monster who was my brother.</p>
