                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay,what now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I turned around to face her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The uh...the twins. I&#39;m aware their birthday is coming up this weekend. I&#39;ve been trying to come up with ideas of things I could gift them. Do you mind helping out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched my brows at her. Seriously? She wanted to get them gifts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending some time with Maddy in the garden,I discovered she could actually be sweet when she wanted to be. When you hear of &#39;sweet but a psycho&#39;, you could think of Maddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the innocence of a chick when she talked about certain things and was so excited as we discussed the gifts. At some point, she even made me laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished with her, I proceeded to the playground and met the kids having fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty Lyric, do you also think aunty Maddy is bad?&#34;Xyla asked as they walked with me to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before my conversation with Maddy, I&#39;d have asked them to stay away. But right now, the girl didn&#39;t seem as dangerous as I thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she&#39;s a nice person. Just be careful, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spent some time with me in my room. When I realized they were dizzy, I offered taking them to their room. But Xyla made an odd request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we spend the night here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please,&#34; Xylon added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped. Were they for real? They wanted to sleep with me? | was surprised, but there was no denying the pleasure that blossomed in my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of-Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rapid knock on my door forced me awake. The dimness of the room when I opened my eyes made me think it was the middle of the night. But when I checked the time on my phone, it was four a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that was still too early for anyone to be knocking on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla and Xylon were still asleep, thankfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the door and was surprised to find Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,not just Marta. Furious Marta. The mean bitch l always wanted to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they here?&#34; She strained her neck to look over my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in her state. She looked fully dressed, just like she had been in Jaris&#39; office. Was she just coming home by this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are they doing there?!&#34; The sharpness in her voice brought my attention back to her face.&#34;Xylon!Xyla! Wake up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, what&#39;re you doing? Let them sleep.&#34; I tried to keep my voice low even if she just shouted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were like daggers when they looked at me.&#34;What right do you think you have to take my kids away and let them sleep with you? How dare you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bafflement sketched its signature on my expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t understand. What&#39;s wrong with them sleeping over? It&#39;s not like I took them away from the Pack. Their room is just around the-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t fucking care, Lyric!&#34; Her voice was a pain in the ear. &#34;You have no right whatsoever to spend time with my kids. I don&#39;t want you touching them, I don&#39;t want you holding them, I don&#39;t want you playing with them. Nothing. Nothing at all! Don&#39;t you understand?&#34; | froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay.Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt, Marta had always been a pain in the ass,but today, she was different. This hatred and insistence to stay away from the kids, it seemed new.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard movements behind me and turned to see the twins scrambling away from bed. Of course, she woke them up already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your problem?&#34; I&#39;shook my head as I looked back at her. &#34;Why do you hate me so much? I never...I never even asked for this, Marta. When I was coming here to become Jaris&#39; mate, I didn&#39;t know he had kids. I didn&#39;t know you existed. Yet, every time,you sound like I&#39;m some witch who&#39;s come to wreck your home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned with brighter hatred as she pinned them on me. &#34;You have no idea, Lyric. You&#39;re worse than a witch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy?&#34; Xyla called as she stood beside me at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s gaze wasn&#39;t any softer as she glared at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here? Huh?Is this your room?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins recoiled from how she shouted at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, this was it. Now, she was pissing me off as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it, Marta. If you don&#39;t learn to control your anger, I might have to keep them with me for the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few seconds, her face was blank. Then, she threw her head back and laughed. She fucking laughed like it was funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you say?&#34; She raised her brows. &#34;You think you can take them from me? I&#39;ll die before that happens,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows drew together in confusion as I shook my head at her. What was wrong with her? She didn&#39;t seem....fine today. She grabbed their arms, roughly pulling them toward herself.When I heard Xylon wince, I lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the kids back, hard enough to separate them from Marta and got in their middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it! Stop this madness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, get out of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will. But you have to stop acting like a mad woman so you don&#39;t hurt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They are my kids!&#34; Her eyes blazed as she shouted at me. &#34;Mine! You don&#39;t get to tell me how to handle them. If you need kids to control, then go get yours and leave mine alone. Who knows? You could be barren for all wve know!!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough!&#34; A brisk voice sliced through the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta went slent. Me too. But not the ache in my heart. It was so loud and painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We turned to the directionof the voice and found Jaris dressed in his comfy pajamas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, he walked toward us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34; Jaris asked, his eyes on Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Saying all these in front of the kids?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta looked away, her fear of Jaris overpowering any retort she&#39;d have released.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, sometimes, I wonder how you manage to be one of TCH&#39;s best doctors when you act this way.Take the kids and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t hesitate. She grabbed the kids&#39; hands and left. At least this time she was gentle with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled as I brushed my fingers into my hair, forcing the tears back. Marta always knew how to hit me in the painful spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I wanted my own kids. I wished the ones I had didn&#39;t die. I wish they were still alive just to help like Xylon and Xyla. Maybe that was the reason I was always so protective of the twins. But did she always have to rub it in my face all the time? Did she always have to mock me as if she knew my past?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You okay?&#34; Jaris&#39; soothing voice dragged me out of my bitter mood. I didn&#39;t even realize he&#39;d gotten closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yeah,&#34; I sniffled, tucking some strands of hair beneath my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked everywhere on the floor to avoid looking at him. I was scared he&#39;d see the tears in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t take what she said to heart.You know Marta can be silly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. Yeah, she was worse than silly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. Goodnight.&#34; I didn&#39;t realize how funny it was. It was already four a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t answer until I was already closing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight,Lyric.&#34;</p>
