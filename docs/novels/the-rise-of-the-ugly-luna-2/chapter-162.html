                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know what was wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was suddenly heightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions. Thoughts. And this. This uncontrollable hunger for Lyric Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d woken up with this strangest craving for her. I badly needed to see her face, and it was as though,I&#39;d lose my mind if I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the reason I went to her room this morning to check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our argument, I couldn&#39;t concentrate at the office and had to go get her from TCH. She didn&#39;t even know I&#39;d been waiting in my car for three hours before the end of her shift, and it had been a real struggle not to barge in there while she was still working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted her close to me. To see her face, enjoy her luscious caramel scent and those smiles that were my favorite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I had the strange attack in the car,all I wanted  to do was hold her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t make it any easy on me when she insisted on following me to my room. And she just kept talking...making those lips really tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to tell myself to wait for nighttime when she&#39;d take the pill. But three hours suddenly seemed too far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hunger became impossible to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here we were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand yanking her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With one hand around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was very shocked and didn&#39;t reciprocate the kiss,but she didn&#39;t try to push me away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, not until six seconds later when she had let me kiss the fuck out of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it wasn&#39;t as deep as I wanted because the time wasn&#39;t enough, but it was enough to quell a little of this hunger in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took multiple steps back, her hand rising to her lips. But she didn&#39;t wipe them. She just looked very shocked. Now that it was over, the weight of my action dawned on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just kissed Lyric. For the first time when she was conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. We didn&#39;t say a word to each other.But if she stayed here any longer, there was no telling what I might do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; She nervously brushed some strands of hair behind her ear. &#34;I-I should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop her this time. I watched as she turned around and scurried off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the longest bath, my mind continuously replaying memories of what I did to Lyric. And majorly,how I wanted to do it to her again. And even more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was starting to get serious. Lyric was starting to get a stronger hold on me-too strong for my liking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The disturbing dream happened again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was feeding on someone, sucking off his blood that was too delicious for my liking I tried to stop but it was impossible. The blood tasted like the best meal, and only a fool would want to stop something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued sucking until the victim passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with the same headache as the previous morning.Memories of the dream replayed in my head,bothering me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone like me, this dream wasn&#39;t a good sign,and I knew l&#39;d have to get checked as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got ready for work while thinking of Lyric the whole time.I was conflicted between checking up on her and just letting her be. I had a feeling she wouldn&#39;t want to see me,actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, I decided to check on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was fixing the buttons on my shirt when Kael walked in. I noticed he looked very moody; a kind of look l rarely saw on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked him what was wrong, but he told me not to worry. That was how I knew it was something personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After our usual greeting, he told me the reason he came to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not gonna like this. Another body was found this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand froze mid-motion, making the last button on my shirt remain undone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t shock. Wasn&#39;t anger. But something else entirely.Something akin to fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It has the same pattern from the one you saw last night-no bite marks. Just a cut on the wrist with their blood drained. The guards are afraid of telling you.They&#39;d been very watchful and didn&#39;t know how that happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole time, I kept staring at himn through the mirror as he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing my phones from the table, I started toward the door. &#34;Take me to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that really necessary? It&#39;s just like the one we saw yeste-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was out the door, knowing he&#39;d follow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got to the morgue and I ordered the body be brought out. Kael was right. The pattern was the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became clear to me. This wasn&#39;t the Feeders &#39;pattern. But it was very very familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy feeling pooled in my stomach, making me overly uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I left the morgue, I took the driver&#39;s seat. My Beta and head of security were alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Find your way home. I need to go somewhere,&#34; I said without looking at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you don&#39;t need our company?&#34; Nerion tried to protest.&#34;Come on.We could-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut him off by starting the car and sent it speeding ahead. What I had to do was something personal and didn&#39;t need them with me.</p>
