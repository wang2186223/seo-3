                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry it slipped my mind. I took care of the first three in the morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think that makes it perfect?&#34; He chuckled, pushing off the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good Moon. Watching him move was totally unnerving. It was getting harder to keep my mask on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did not put you in this position to deliver incomplete jobs, Lyric.I want perfection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t ask to be in this position-I wanted to yell at him but knew better than to utter such to the monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I resisted the urge to retreat as he got closer to me. Before I knew it, the back of his hand was connecting to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head reeled to the side, my teeth clenching tightly against one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my jaw roughly, forcing me to look at him. &#34;What could possibly make you forget my order, huh?Have you been distracted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought back the tears as I stared dead into his eyes. My cheek hurt, but I wasn&#39;t going to give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry. Not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking answer! Have you been distracted!?&#34; He yelled into my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slowly shook my head, swallowing down any retort I&#39;d have given to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,why did you forget?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, I put up a small struggle, getting my jaw free from his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been trying, Caden!&#34; My voice came out louder than I intended. &#34;You send me on these side errands while I have work to do at the company. I didn&#39;t finish with the third person until noon today, then I had to get to the company to get some work done over there. I&#39;m stressed, Caden! So, would you blame me if I forget sometimes!?&#34; His hand came to my hair at once, pulling so hard I yelped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the hair, he pulled me closer to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talking back at me now, I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tightened his grip in my hair. &#34;I don&#39;t care how stressed you are, Lyric. You&#39;re to do what I want, when i want it. You live to serve me, remember? So, you fucking do it right!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accompaniedhis words with a punch to my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned painfully and tried bending in half, except he wouldn&#39;t even let me as he forced me to stand straight with my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the next time you talk back at me, you&#39;ll get much worse.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shoved me roughly to hit the wall. My head hurt from the sudden impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched my side and waited till he was gone before I ran into my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Just one more chance. Please, my King! I&#39;m begging you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His plea sounded boring now. I wondered how long it&#39;d take for them to accept how worthless it was at this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You broke the rule, Darwin. And according to the law, your properties must be seized from you until further notice. At the right time, I&#39;ll release them back to you,&#34; I replied without looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But how will my family and I get to live? Please, My King; I beg you to reconsider.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve thought about your family before you stole from a business partner. Weren&#39;t you aware you were bringing suffering to his own family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. And I&#39;m sorry for what happened. He&#39;s even forgiven me already and-&#34; &#34;Well, I don&#39;t forgive. Now, get out befoe I truly reconsider my decision and have you banished instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he still wouldn&#39;t leave on his own, I ordered my guards to drag him out. I found it funny when people expected mercy from me. Mercy was for the weak. I regret the times I didn&#39;t take action and simply showed mercy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished from the courtroom for the day, I headed for the kids&#39; room to check on them. I&#39;d been so busy I hadn&#39;t seen them since the previous day. I heard Maddy took them out earlier today and would love to see how they were doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think you should&#39;ve gone a little easier on the man?&#34; Kael asked beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d handed a lot of men today, but I knew the one he was referring to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He broke the rule. What did you expect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know he broke the rule. But I&#39;ve seen you let go of similar cases of recent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I hate myself for showcasing that level of weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am merely acting like a King. If anyone breaks the rule, they get punished for it. It&#39;s as simple as that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped talking when he reached the kids&#39; room. Xyla was already asleep-unfortunately. But Xylon was still up, drawing something in his book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, dad,&#34; he stood up from the floor to give me a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been? Heard you went out with Maddy today? Did you have fun?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Xyla slept off.&#34; He glanced at her. She must&#39;ve played so hard she got tired. Typical Xyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I imagined her saying much if she was awake. She&#39;d have described how her day went in detail. The girl was a talkative-something I loved about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why are you still up?&#34; My gaze fell on his drawing book. &#34;Drawing something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and sat back on the floor. I took a closer look at the drawing. It was a weird one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon was definitely going to be a good artist when he grew up. But for now, his sketches were still amateurish.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Observing carefully, I could tell it was a rough sketch of a man. At least, that was what it looked like. The person had beards and a moustache with a hoodie over his head. The drawing looked poor and unclear,but this was what I could make out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s this?&#34; I asked out of curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing prepared me for his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mental snap echoed within, sending a frosty wave coursing through me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew he was wrong, but nobody had mentioned that name around me in six months. Getting to hear it now all of a sudden filled me with a bizzare sentiment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you still thinking about her?&#34; I tried as much as I could to mask the anger from my voice. &#34;Besides,that isn&#39;t Lyric. That&#39;s a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s her!&#34; He glanced up at me. &#34;I smelt her at the park today. It&#39;s her.&#34;</p>
