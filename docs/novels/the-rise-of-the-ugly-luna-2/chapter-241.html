                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was working on my laptop in the living room when Mr. Ming knocked on the door. I was surprised to see he was the one when I opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Lyric. Hope I&#39;m not disturbing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all, Mr. Ming. Do you need something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not exactly. Just wanted to know if you&#39;ll still be coming to the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party... I&#39;d actually forgotten about that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, while I had wanted to go initially to clear my head, I didn&#39;t think I could do that anymore with Caden here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve changed my mind,&#34; I said with a sorry smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why are you changing your mind? A party sounds fun,&#34; Caden&#39;s voice wrapped me in a heavy cloak of anxiety as he came up to stand beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness.I thought he was in the bedroom and wouldn&#39;t hear us. When the hell did he come out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m just stressed, Caden. I just think I could take care of other things with the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,my hardworking Lady,&#34; he put a hand around my shoulder. It took me a lot of self control not to push it off in front of the man. &#34;You work so hard that you forget to live sometimes. Tonight will be different. We&#39;re going to the party.&#34; I stared up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really don&#39;t want to go.l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be going, Mr. Ming,&#34; he cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit the inside of my cheeks to stop myself from saying any more. The asshole definitely knew what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very well. I&#39;ll be delighted to see you two down there,&#34; Mr. Ming said with that usual smile that made his eyes smaller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He retrieved a card from his pocket. &#34;This is your pass. You&#39;ll need to show it to the guards when you arrive.The time is seven p.m. I&#39;ll be expecting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut the door a little too hard when he left while Caden continued staring at the card. &#34;Hope you have a dress to wear, Lyric. We have a party to attend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my attempts to convince Caden to let it go, he insisted and forced me with him to the party.He even fished out a dress for me which ended up being a long blue dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands grew clammy with sweat with every step that brought us closer to the rooftop. There was one thought that had been constantly nagging at me, threatening me: &#34;He&#39;s going to be there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As much as I tried to ignore it, I knew there was a high possibility. And gods, I didn&#39;t want to see him.Especially not with Caden beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air at the rooftop was cold. But the party going on was colorful, classy and luxurious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The music played softly in the background while the guests chatted and laughed in small groups, most of them holding flutes of wine. The space smelt of wealth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t exactly what concerned me. As I scoured my eyes around, I wasn&#39;t admiring the guests.I was looking out for &#39;him.&#39; And it didn&#39;t take long before I found him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart picked up on its race; my senses became more aware of everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was talking with someone and hadn&#39;t seen me yet, and a part of me prayed he wouldn&#39;t. Caden was holding my hand. I didn&#39;t want him to see that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Ming came to us with a broad smile. &#34;Ms. Lyric! Mr. Caden. You did come.&#34; &#34;I told you we would. The party&#39;s lovely, by the way,&#34; Caden replied warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! Thank you for that. Come with me; l&#39;ll introduce you to some of the guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the lead while I prayed something would distract him. I didn&#39;t want to move around!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes found Jaris again. He still seemed lost in whatever conversation he was having. My brows furrowed when I noticed a strange sight. There was a lady beside him that dusted the arm of his shirt, as if it remove dirt or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something didn&#39;t feel right about it. I knew Jaris. He wouldn&#39;t allow even his secretary touch him that way.Who was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her back was turned to me, I didn&#39;t know what she looked like. But from the shape I saw behind, I think she&#39;d be a pretty girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion weren&#39;t at the party with him. It left me to wonder where else they could be since they always enjoyed keeping Jaris company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Caden and I followed Mr. Ming, the asshole did something crazy. He put a hand around my waist!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it.Please!&#34; I whispered but kept my voice firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; He leaned in so his breath brushed against my ear. &#34;Looks like the only way I can get your attention away from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat ran dry. He caught me staring at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a public space, Caden. Please, take your hand off. I don&#39;t likeiI insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being in a public space gives me even more reasons to do it. The people think we&#39;re a perfect couple,Lyric. It&#39;s only right to give them some evidence from time to time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to stylishly step out of his hold, but his grip only grew firmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t stay still this instant, I might do something I won&#39;t regret.&#34; There was an icier edge to his tone, the one that always hinted at hurtful promises.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger swelled in my chest. But there was nothing I could do. So, I had to endure the sting of his hand as Mr.Ming led us to his guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He introduced us to various guests who were delighted to see us. Most of them got interested in one of our companies and even took our contacts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxiety bubbled up within me when Mr. Ming led us toward a direction I didn&#39;t wish to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was there! He was going to see me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I think I need to use the restroom.&#34; I tried to slow down my steps, except Caden wouldn&#39;t let me out of his grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you can hold it in a little longer, love. I&#39;ll accompany you myself when we&#39;re done with Ming,&#34; he said with a smile that almost seemed genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think she should go if she&#39;s pressed, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Don&#39;t worry about it, Ming. I&#39;m eager to get introduced to the rest of the guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man smiled and continued the tour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And finally, we got to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; eyes were already on me before we reached them. His cold stare, seeming so empty and devoid of excitement unleashed a chill that snaked its way down my back. His eyes fell on Caden&#39;s hand around my waist, and the look of cold indifference that I found in his eyes made me shudder. He didn&#39;t seem angry or jealous. Only...irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so much like the Jaris I&#39;d been scared of almost a year ago when my father introduced me to him to get mated. Looked so much like the cold-blooded Alpha who had interest in anything but love. He looked like the Jaris I&#39;d been happy I&#39;d escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was the Jaris I knew truly gone? &#34;Gentlemen,&#34; Mr. Ming addressed the other businessmen in the circle. &#34;Please, meet Mr. Caden and his Lady.&#34; He went ahead to add more details about us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so nervous and couldn&#39;t even keep my gaze up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your lady&#39;s quite beautifuI,.&#34; One of the men at the table complimented.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden laughed. &#34;Oh, I know she is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally took note of the lady beside Jaris. She had an elegant pose and stared at me like she held a grudge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hua. How&#39;re you doing?&#34; Mr. Ming asked her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, she replied; &#34;I&#39;m fine, Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dad? She was Ming&#39;s daughter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Jaris. I hope you&#39;re doing well, sir? Is the party going well for you?&#34; I noticed he used a more respectful tone on Jaris. I wasn&#39;t sure these people knew much of our history-like what happened between the three of us back in our country. Otherwise, Mr. Ming wouldn&#39;t have brought us to this circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris,being who he was, took a sip from his flute and shrugged. &#34;The party was going well until a while ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to the girl beside him. &#34;Want to go somewhere else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something ticked in my brain when I saw Jaris wrap his hand around her waist. She giggled, leaned into him and placed her hands on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My air supply seemed to have been cut off. Why did the sight affect me so much?</p>
