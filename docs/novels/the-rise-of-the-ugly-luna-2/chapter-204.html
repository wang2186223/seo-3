                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shocked gasps and whispers rippled through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards started moving, carrying in big ballot boxes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could only watch in awe. Jaris planned all this for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place got noisy as poeople discussed the issue.I excused myself from the stage, running to a quiet hallway where I wept more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did I deserve this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just yesterday, I&#39;d been worried sick that there might never be a solution for me. And today, he had gone the extra mile for me. The jerk was ready to give up his crown for my sake. What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard approaching footsteps and knew it was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced him, my vision blurred, offering a quivering smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You jerk.&#34; I hit him lightly in the chest. &#34;Why would you plan all of these and not even tell me? I didn&#39;t-|didn&#39;t even say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked a brow at me. &#34;Well, I didn&#39;t mention anything about you giving a speech, did I? I only asked if you were strong enough to stand before the Council.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed then hugged him, burying my tear-soaked face in the dip of his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. So so much. I don&#39;t deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spanked my ass. &#34;Say that again and I&#39;ll have you locked up. You&#39;re special and deserve every bit of it.&#34;He pulled my hair back so he could look into my face.&#34;I promised you I wouldn&#39;t let anyone hurt you. And no matter what the result turns out to be, I still won&#39;t let you get hurt, Lyric. They&#39;ll have to come through me first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled through the tears that hadn&#39;t stopped flowing. I cupped his cheeks, giving him a deep kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you, Jaris Dreadmoor. Today, tomorrow, and forever.&#34; I&#39;d never said anything with more conviction in my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew from the bottom of my heart that it was true.There was not a single soul I could ever love more than the man in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand wrapped possessively around my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love you too, Lyric.More than you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hugging him again, I rested my head on his shoulder.This time, I caught Marta staring at us from the start of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not stare. Glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked vicious in her long red dress, hands on her waist, mouth twisted in fury. She looked like she could murder someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although the speech my friends and acquaintances had given seemed to have some effect on the crowd,I was still damn scared on what the result would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The voting took some hours as more people came from outside to cast theirs when they heard what was happening.. When each member voted, a silver pin was pierced into their thumb to mark them for the day and prevent them from returning to cast another vote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so nervous I couldn&#39;t eat despite how hungry l was. Not even when Jaris offered me something l was craving and tried to force me to eat it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the vote finally ended and it was time for the results, my anxiety got even higher than I thought possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was with me and held my hand as we walked to the stage where Jaris was already discussing with the Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got this, Ly. Everything will be fine,&#34; my best friend said reassuringly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it did little to calm my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Are you sure? I mean, what if the people weren&#39;t that moved and still went ahead to vote against it?Does that mean I&#39;ll be handed to the Executioners?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t stop saying shit right now, I might actually spank you.&#34; For effect, he hit me lightly on the shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally let go of my hand. I nervously rubbed them together,reciting a silent prayer on my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairman Lyon did the announcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We want to thank everyone of you for voting. This shows how much you value the matters of our community. The result will be called now, and if your opinion didn&#39;t win, please note that it was wvell received and appreciated. Over here, we work with the highest vote.&#34; He looked down at a sheet of a paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For those in support of maintaining the law concerning Siphons, we have a hundred and fifty-nine votes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d stopped breathing, waiting for the second shoe to drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For those in support of repealing the law...&#34; he paused for effect, staring down at the paper. &#34;We have four hundred and thirty-three votes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know which was faster-the explosion of noise from the crowd or my heart spiraling down from the maximum elevation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart kicked against my ribcage as I stood there in silence for sometime, staring wide-eyed at the crowd and wondering if this was a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Yes!&#34; Jace screamed beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came to stand in front of me and shook me roughly. &#34;I fucking told you! | fucking told you!&#34; Oh,gods.It happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It.Happened.</p>
