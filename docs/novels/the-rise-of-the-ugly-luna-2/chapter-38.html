                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every organ in my body tightened with rage. Clumsily, I managed to lock the towel around my body, but it felt useless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d wasted enough time for him to see every inch of my naked body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell!? Don&#39;t you knock!?&#34; I said at the top of my voice, my fingers shaking as they weakly held the towel to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care that he was the Alpha I didn&#39;t want to piss anymore. Right now, I was fucking pissed!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris just saw me naked without my consent! And it wouldn&#39;t have happened if he&#39;d just knocked!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe it was my fault for not locking the door. No, how was I supposed to know that someone like him would want to come in without knocking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris looked stunned. Too stunned. I&#39;d never seen him this way before. Didn&#39;t even think I&#39;d was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, slowly, raked over me, stopping at my legs. It became uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I apologize.&#34; He finally muttered, stepped out of the room and slammed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in the name of the moon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I was wrong for going in without knocking. I didn&#39;t even know what I was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I guess I thought that the odds of finding Lyric naked would be quite low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How I got in wasn&#39;t exactly the biggest problem for me. I was more concerned about the fact that seeing her naked brought about a certain reaction; one I did not expect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiver has traveled all the way through my chest, down to my abdomen, and finally to my groin. It looked like the most beautiful body I&#39;d ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t explain it, but I wanted to see more of it. I was as hard as a rock already. How did it have that much effect on me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air suddenly felt hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching my office, I took off my tie immediately and groaned as I undid my buttons. Why was I suddenly uncomfortable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A rapid knock reached my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who is it?&#34; I rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Lyric!&#34; She sounded really pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. I couldn&#39;t see her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not seeing anyone!&#34; My voice was grumpier than I intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I need to talk to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, and to my shock, she fucking opened the door and let herself in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; I snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing brown flannel pants and a plain black top now. Her hair was still wet, reminding me of what I&#39;d seen earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She couldn&#39;t be here. I couldn&#39;t see her. Maybe, I could get Kael to come throw her out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you did was wrong! How could you just come into my room without knocking?&#34; Her eyes were ruddy.Oh, she wasn&#39;t just angry, she was ashamed that I&#39;d seen her little decency.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already apologized.What the fuck do you want me to do? Go back in time and erase the memory?&#34; &#34;Yes! If that&#39;s possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,get ouut. I can&#39;t deal with you right now!&#34; I randomly grabbed some papers from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never been this decomposed my whole life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just here to tell you to be more careful. You don&#39;t just barge into people&#39;s rooms when they could be having a private moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, maybe you should&#39;ve locked your door. Have you considered that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? You can&#39;t blame me for not locking my own door. Don&#39;t try to put this on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric! Just go!&#34; I snapped, throwing the papers in my hands all around the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flinched, her eyes glossy with tears and fear. Well, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally-thank goodness-she stormed out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I picked up my tie and proceeded to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong with me. Terribly wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as the warm water cascaded down my body, all I could think of was the image of Lyric Harper, naked in her room. I could vividly remember what every curve of hers looked like-how stunning her legs were, how round and full her breasts were, and how shocked she had been.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that I was doing it. I&#39;d seen a lot of naked women in my life, yet getting a glimpse of Lyric today made me react in ways I never thought was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared down at myself in the shower. I was as hard as rock. Painfully hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows gathered in a frown as I ground my teeth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Don&#39;t do it, Jaris. Don&#39;t do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But my subconsciousness was deaf. Against my actual will, I took my hand to my erection, jerking it. I hissed at the rush of emotions, my blood seeming to run faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image filled my head, and my hand worked faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Naked. Artful breasts. Slightly bushy but beautiful-looking cunt. Slender waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned low in my throat as I reached that very point I&#39;d been craving for years. That very paradise I&#39;d missed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came very hard, my release fillingmy hand and dropping to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes went close as my head lifted up in ecstasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a whole minute to get over the wave. And when it was finally over, and my sanity had returned, it dawned on me that I&#39;d just cum to the image of Lyric Harper.</p>
