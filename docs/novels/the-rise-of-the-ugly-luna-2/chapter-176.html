                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way to Lyric&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at her doorway, I watched her eyes beam at the sight of me. They&#39;d sparkled like stars the very second I opened her door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; she said with a mouthful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a small smile, leaning against the doorframe with my hands in my pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the time to analyze how well our relationship had evolved over the months. From hating that I was getting mated to her, to being irritated because I thought she slept with Zarek, and now, being this fascinated by her that it hurts me to be away from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know her face wasn&#39;t the only pretty thing she had. The girl was beautiful, inside out with a heart I&#39;d die for. Was our contract actually meant to be for a year alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; Her brows were already creased with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was astonishing how quickly she could discern when there was a problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Chairman called.&#34; I didn&#39;t sound like I had a problem. &#34;They want me at the Central Pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes spun around the floor for a heartbeat, then soared up to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Caden,&#34; I helped her innocent thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It&#39;s-It&#39;s possible they&#39;re just calling for something else.Caden-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I expected it, Lyric. It was part of the reason I went to the cabin. But unfortunately,&#34; he shrugged. &#34;I&#39;m not ready to face them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t have come back here in the first place.I just thought I was better since I always felt better with Lyric around. Plus, I missed the Pack and kids so much,being away for a week was already torture enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should head out, then.&#34; She stood up, wiping her hands on her jeans. &#34;I&#39;ll get ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let a subtle laugh. Gods, she was so cute when she clung onto hope even in hopeless situations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to get tested. They&#39;ll use blood, and we both know I&#39;m not going to pass it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a more serious note, I might end up losing Darkspire if they got to know I was a Hexed wolf.A Hexed wolf with control issues wasn&#39;t fit to be Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what was last night for?&#34; She approached me.&#34;I mean, all the exploring and letting you do things I&#39;d never done with anyone before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did she mean by that? She wasn&#39;t a virgin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was too wrapped out in the moment to point that out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we were creating new memories? Memories you could hold onto?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;Long before I met you, I&#39;d heard a lot about the ruthless Jaris Dreadmoor. You were on the lips of everyone; the envy of every Alpha. I don&#39;t think you got that title by running away from your fears. I know... I know this is different. It&#39;s about life and death. But how on earth would Jaris Dreadmoor ever run away from a challenge? In what world would he give up without giving it a try, at least?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took my hands. &#34;I know he&#39;s your brother, but l hate him so much. If you give up now, it&#39;ll be him winning. It&#39;ll be him getting away with what he did to me that night.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the tremor in her voice.&#34;This isn&#39;t you, Jaris. Please, don&#39;t let him win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****	****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric&#39;s small hand was intertwined in mine as we  walked into the Silver Citadel. On the first table was Chairman Lyon. Then, the tables that followed next were occupied by the Elders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt him before I looked in the corner and found him sitting alone. He wNas dressed in black, almost getting lost in the darkness of the space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the way Lyric&#39;s hand tensed in mine.I hated the fact that she was still this scared of him.I imagined her having flashbacks of the things he did to her that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released my hand from hers and went forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; Chairman Lyon called. &#34;I&#39;m glad you came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elders gave me these unusual stares, like I was a beast in their midst. The corners of the hall were filled with guards who were clearly there to grab me in case I became a threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the corner again to where Caden was seated. &#34;Is there a reason he&#39;s here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole&#39;s lips lifted in a smirk. &#34;Hello, brother.&#34; He looked at Lyric.&#34;Hi,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was softer with her, as were his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something dark stirred in my chest, prompting me to go forward and rip his heart out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only we didn&#39;t have that stupid pact between us....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman started talking. &#34;Your brother here-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He has a name,&#34; I cut him off, my voice like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyon nodded. &#34;Caden. He came here with a report that&#39;s gotten every one of us worried. He claims you&#39;re a Hexed wolf who&#39;s currently battling with control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though a storm started in my chest, I remained calm and focused on Lyon. &#34;I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really,brother? Like you didn&#39;t confront me about it?&#34;The asshole asked from the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my time turning to look at him. &#34;Is this what you&#39;ve been reduced to? Going around, making silly accusations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris, are you trying to say these accusations are false?&#34; Elder Lucas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I am shocked you all fell for it. I mean, you know who the bastard is; how desperate and senseless he is.Yet,you&#39;d take his word seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden laughed, but I didn&#39;t even spare him another glance this time. &#34;Uh...Alpha Jaris, I hope you understand that this is a very serious accusation. As much as we love and trust you, we still need to make certain that we&#39;re safe around you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded to the guards in the corner. &#34;I hope you don&#39;t mind us performing a little test.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, giving nothing away. Not my rage, my doubt, or the fact that a tiny part of me still felt they were right and wanted to put an end to this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard movements around me but didn&#39;t look,knowing it was the guards getting what I needed for the&#39;test.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t look at Lyric either, not wanting to see the worry and encouragement in her eyes. I&#39;d hate to disappoint her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, Jaris, I&#39;d put an end to this madness,&#34;Caden said from the corner. He remained ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two guards came to me with Cryptic chains. I held my hands out to them and let them lock it around me. I&#39;d be foolish to protest. Because if I truly failed the test,I needed to be sure they were safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric&#39;s words had been a big encouragement coming here.I mean,the girl brought out a part of me that the beast had been suppressing. Jaris Dreadmoor never backs down from a challenge.I never let others win over me. It was how I&#39;d made it this far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I still couldn&#39;t help but not trust myself.I remember what I was like without control years ago.I was worse than Caden-which was why I had been so eager to get rid of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I failed this test and my urges are awakened, I might kill most of the people in this room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris, are you sure you&#39;re ready for this?&#34;Lyon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could answer, Lyric&#39;s voice answered in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;re ready, Alpha.&#39; Those were her words from the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I have this faith in you. I know you can do it.&#39;</p>
