                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We left the bar together, heading to his hotel as he called it. We drove off in his Arcanis GT. It was one of the most expensive cars in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever this man was, he was filthy rich. Could he possibly be an Alpha?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A part of me had been tempted to ask questions, but none of it mattered. We were simply going to make love and never see each other again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the best night of my life. He made love to me in the sweetest way. Although, it was my first time,l wasn&#39;t sure intimacy could be any sweeter. I didn&#39;t want us to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger had been shocked to know I was a virgin. The entire session, he kept asking if I was fine and needed him to be more gentle. For the first time,someone cared about my feelings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But something unusual happened during the intercourse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything had been going so fine until he suddenly jerked while inside meand came with a deep groan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked, but we were both in the moment and could not ask questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got off me almost immediately, sitting on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is strange,&#34; he muttered to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was equally confused. I thought he couldn&#39;t finish on a woman?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, and from how long it was, I could tell he was staring at me like l was a puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still lying on my back, exhausted. Soon, he joined me, lying beside me. He held his head up with his elbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; He ran a finger along my jaw. The touch was electric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. I am just an ugly girl who has been abandoned by everyone she&#39;s ever come across.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, he took off his mask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth fell open in shock at the face before me.Good Moon! If he wasn&#39;t the most stunning man l&#39;d ever met!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was too good-looking. I could never have someone like him. He was too good for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled the duvet further to conceal my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve told me you were a virgin at the bar,&#34;he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did it matter? I didn&#39;t care about being a virgin anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, his hand reached for my face. Realizing what he had in mind, I gasped and recoiled. &#34;No.&#34; I shook my head, gripping the duvet tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? You&#39;ve seen my face.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Our deal still stands. There&#39;s nothing to be afraid of.&#34; Hle added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You don&#39;t understand! You&#39;ll hate me if you see my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was going too smoothly. I didn&#39;t want anything to ruin it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m ugly.&#34; I mumbled, dipping my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for my face again and this time, I didn&#39;t try to stop him. This was my fate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled off the mask, put a finger under my chin and tipped my head up to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears glistened in my eyes as I stared into his silver charming eyes. He was staring right at my face, at my scar. He was going to run away now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered and closed my eyes when he ran a finger along the scar. What was he doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; His tone was soft, his fingers still caressing my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met his gaze and so far, there was no resentment in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-Someone attacked me.&#34; I swallowed. &#34;| was abducted and blindfolded while they hurt me. I&#39;ve visited a lot of doctors, but none have been able to help&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. He didn&#39;t take his eyes off me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re beautiful,&#34; he murmured. I frowned. What was he talking about? &#34;You really think the scar makes you ugly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, pulling my face away from his grasp. &#34;I am ugly. Everyone tells me.&#34; More to my surprise, he pulled me in beside him,wrapping his arms around my shoulder. &#34;Until tonight, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart quickened as I listened to his heartbeat with my head on his chest. Uncontrollably, a tear escaped my eye. He was lying. He only wanted me to feel better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think we could adjust our deal? I&#39;d love to spend another day with you,&#34; he said, shocking me to the core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What!? This was not possible. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart melted instantly. For the first time in my life,I was being begged to stay. Not leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I buried my face in his chest as I responded: &#34;I&#39;d love to.&#34; But like everyone eIse,he lied to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like everyone else, I was deceived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning,he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up and couldn&#39;t find him in bed. There was no note, no trace that he had even been with me aside from the ache in-between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to make it worse, someone showed up at the door, asking me to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man I came with last night, do you think he&#39;d come back?&#34; I asked the man, my heart racing in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. It was his idea to get you to leave. He said he doesn&#39;t want to see you anywhere near this property.Please,leave this instant,&#34; the man said and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And just like that, my heart was shattered all over.But surprisingly, it hurt more than when I had been rejected by Roderick.</p>
