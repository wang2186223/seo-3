                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just knew it the moment I ran into the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been lucky enough to get a flight coming to Silver Citadel, but of whnat use was it when I missed the most important show anyway?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise coming from the hall was too much. The music was loud, screams of celebrations and even drums being rolled in different parts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people were in their happiest mood. A new King had been chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart pounded with anxiety as I made my way through the crowd, looking for a familiar face | could ask how it went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who won? Jaris or Zarek? What if Caden&#39;s plan worked in my absence? Gods, I&#39;d never be able to forgive myself if this whole thing was ruined because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was stressful getting through the excited crowd.When I still couldn&#39;t see a familiar face, I stopped a random person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who won, please?&#34; I had to shout so she could hear me above the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady looked all sweaty and drunk and was still holding a plastic cup of wine. &#34;Who else?! Alpha Jaris!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The relief that hit me was enough to crush me to the ground. My hand flew to my chest as I staggered back on my feet,releasing deep breaths I didn&#39;t even know I needed to release.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris won. Jaris was King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My strength was renewed. This time, I pushed through the crowd with more determination, laughing as I ran along.I needed to find him. My new King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I kept running, I overheard some people talking about the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the Alpha did was awesome! I didn&#39;t know he had such strengths and tactics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah! But I still can&#39;t believe he killed Zarek. Didn&#39;t see that one coming though.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped dead in my tracks, my eyes rolling back in disbelief.No wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He killed who?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned in the direction of the people that had been talking. My palms became sweaty in an instant. But before I could go to them, someone called my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned hastily to see Maddy running toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing one of her very short dresses tonight.As a matter of fact, I could see her thighs. However, I was too shocked by the news I just heard to even look angry about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where in Moon&#39;s name have you been? We&#39;ve all been looking for you! Especially that one they call my brother.&#34; She rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her excitement returned as she took my hand. &#34;I wish you had been here to see what happened, Lyric! Jaris was awesome! The strength he displayed, it was like nothing we&#39;d ever seen before! He just... He was on his back this minute,and the next minute he was on Zarek. He beat him the hell up in a different way and ripped his heart out. It was insane! But he won!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed tightly, my heart still beating painfully.Before tonight, I already knew an opponent could be killed in the fight. But what the people didn&#39;t know was that Jaris was a Hexed Wolf who couldn&#39;t be killed easily. So, my only fear had been for Zarek. And just like | feared,he was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy hadn&#39;t been the best one. I mean, he almost raped me. But I didn&#39;t expect we&#39;d lose him so soon.His Pack must be pretty mad at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go see Jaris. He&#39;s been very worried and angry.&#34; Maddy broke into my thoughts. &#34;Although, I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you choose to run away right now. I don&#39;t even like him.&#34; She rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,she seemed pretty excited for someone who didn&#39;t want to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;ll go meet him. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found my way to him. He was in the midst of some Elders, the Elders seeming to be saying something serious, yet I doubted they had Jaris&#39; attention as he kept looking around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes finally landed on mine, and the shock and relief I saw in them was heart-warming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even try to excuse himself from the Elders.He just walked away from them, came to me, grabbed my hand and led me away from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop until we were in a less noisy hallway  &#34;What the fuck,Lyric?!Where on earth have you been?&#34;He rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite looking like he wanted to snap my neck, I still managed a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won. Congratulations, King Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had a really nice ring to it. King Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is no time for jokes,&#34; he snapped. &#34;You weren&#39;t home.Where did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked away the excitement, now hating that l missed the actual show. I wasn&#39;t there to encourage him; wasn&#39;t there to give him his first hug. That was kind of sad, really, after putting in so much effort to make this happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More reasons to hate Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have any cramps, Lyric?&#34; His tone turned serious. &#34;I swear, I&#39;d pull down your pants just to check if you don&#39;t answer me right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped to the floor.&#34;I-I&#39;m fine. You won.That&#39;s all that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not all that fucking matters!&#34; He grabbed me roughly again. &#34;Where the hell are you? Did Caden do something?&#34; I looked him in the eye but couldn&#39;t give him an answer. Yet, it was more than enough answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he released my hand, his eyes glinting with shock and hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden took you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped to the floor again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you didn&#39;t say a word?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He had the kids!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Jaris. Today was too important for me to ruin in any way.I was ready to do anything to make sure Caden didn&#39;t win.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he asked me to explain, I went ahead to tell him the story from beginning to the end. He only grew a bit calmer when I told him Caden didn&#39;t touch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, his punch to my face didn&#39;t leave a bruise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, you should&#39;ve said something, Lyric! He could&#39;ve badly hurt you. How do you think any of this victory would&#39;ve been worth it if something happened to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart clenched at the thought of how the said victory was achieved. &#34;Zarek didn&#39;t make it.&#34; My voice dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a slight hesitation before he answered.&#34;I had no intention of hurting him. I think Caden got to him somehow and told him to use blood against me.And since you weren&#39;t here, it was more difficult resisting it. I-I almost lost control.&#34; He sighed. &#34;It got too much, I had to focus my anger on something else rather than feeding on him in the presence of everyone. I had to kill him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, totally understanding him. I just hated it when people died around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. Finally, I leaned in and gave him a hug,wrapping my arms tightly around his waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You won in the end. Congratulations.&#34; I pulled my head back a little so I could look into his face. &#34;Sorry I wasn&#39;t here to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He spanked me on the ass, earning a giggle from me.&#34;I should be the one apologizing for always getting you caught up in my troubles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,that was true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet I couldn&#39;t have it any other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; someone showed up at the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders are calling. They need you on stage.&#34; I followed Jaris back to the hall and joined the others in applauding him as he took the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairman Lyon began his speech, thanking everyone for their support and contributions. He congratulated Jaris once more,telling him he couldn&#39;t wait to see him as King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The speech went on for a while. The crowning of the grand King and Luna was scheduled to happen in three days. After which, Jaris and his family would move to the Central Pack House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mentioning the grand Luna brought the Chairman to an important topic. Jaris needed to introduce who the grand Luna would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he was told to make the announcement,excitement bubbled in my chest. But I grew confused when I saw the solemn look on Jaris&#39; face. Why didn&#39;t he look happy all of a sudden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The microphone was handed to him. I watched happily as he thanked the crowd for their support and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I imagined him calling me to the crowd; telling everyone I&#39;d be his grand Luna. A smile tugged at my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For the grand Luna who would rule beside me,&#34; he began. &#34;It&#39;s none other than the mother of my children-Marta Monroe.&#34;</p>
