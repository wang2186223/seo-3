                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose to my feet despite how weak I was. At first, I felt this heavy numbness. Until slowly, it turned into insanity and I laughed so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve gone mad, Marta. Now you&#39;re fabricating lies against my child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can come over here and see for yourself if you think I&#39;m lying. Only problem is, everyone would get to see I&#39;m telling the truth. Think about it-you&#39;re a Siphon. Being your daughter, there&#39;s always been a high chance for her to inherit it. Perhaps, it&#39;d have been Xylon if he was a female.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.You&#39;re lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw her that day, okay? I was making a call around the corner when I heard a scream from your room and went to check it out. That was how I found Xyla Siphoning the Luna &#39;cause she wanted to save you.According to her, she acted on pure instincts and didn&#39;t know exactly what she was doing. Before I could stop her, the Luna was dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No...&#34; I slid to the floor, my other hand sliding into my hair and pulling so hard at my roots like I wanted to separate the two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She said she&#39;s been noticing the signs for some weeks but didn&#39;t understand it. So, she told no one about it.That day, she and Xylon were coming to your room to talk to you. They saw the Luna hurting you. Xyla got angry and acted on pure instinct to save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please...&#34; This was too hard to hear. My heart felt like it was about to collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been looking for the Siphon that killed the Luna, Lyric. There. You have your answer. It was your daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can this be...&#34; &#34;If you&#39;re feeling this way, imagine how devastated Jaris would feel if he gets to know his own daughter killed his mother. She&#39;d always look likea monster in his eyes. And the people? What do you think they would say? It&#39;d come as a confirmation to them that indeed, Siphons are monsters. They&#39;d never get over a six year old killing her grandmother. I&#39;ve kept this a secret because I didn&#39;t want to ruin the relationship between the kids and Jaris. But there&#39;d be no need to continue with this secret if you expose mine. Besides,the kids are better off without you. I mean, what&#39;s your plan exactly? To keep running with them? That&#39;s the kind of life you want to introduce them to when they&#39;ve been good this whole time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit the flesh on my hand, trying to stifle the loud whimper cooking up in my/ throat. It was impossible and soon,it came out of my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>gods, please. My life couldn&#39;t be this miserable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay away. I&#39;m giving you a chance to do something for your kids. Leave them be, Lyric. You don&#39;t want to ruin their lives just like yours is already ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hung up. But for a minute, my phone was still hanging over my ear, my mind unable to comprehend lowering it down from my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid on the floor in the dark corner and wept so hard. My daughter was cursed like me? Jaris would hate her if he ever gets to know she killed his mother. Her life would be ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods; I couldn&#39;t believe my unluckiness could rub off on my kids in this manner. Marta was right. They were better off without me. She might be blackmailing me right now to get what she wanted, but she was right. What kind of a mother would I be if I took them from their comfortable life with their father and make them be on the run with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do that to them. Even if it killed me. It was my cross to carry alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always thought people who committed suicides were foolish. I was always like-no matter how hard it is in life, you have to keep fighting. Only a fool gives up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone had told me years later, I&#39;d be contemplating taking my own life, I wouldn&#39;t have believed. What was the point of living when everything was against me? I couldn&#39;t be with the man l love, I couldn&#39;t be with my kids. The whole world was hunting me, including those that wanted to use me for their personal gains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My life was a mess at this point. It was useless to keep fighting when there was nothing to fight for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I contemplated the numerous ways I&#39;d take my life. There was poison, drowning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before that, I concluded I had to do something first. It was crazy, but it was the last time I was ever going to speak to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face as I listened to the phone beep, Jaris&#39; name displayed on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I was going to miss him. I wished we&#39;d have been able to live as a family, even if it was just a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feared he wasn&#39;t going to take the call. It was about beeping to an end when he finally did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went mute, my brain too slow in processing the fact that Jaris did pick my call. He wanted to talk to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; He seemed surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has he tried reaching me before now? Maybe when the phone was off? Or did he never care at all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;J-Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This very moment seemed surreal. Seemed different from the chaos our lives had been. Suddenly, it didn&#39;t feel like I&#39;d &#39;killed&#39; his mother. It didn&#39;t feel like the Executioners were after me, and it also didn&#39;t feel like we held any grudges against each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, it was as though I&#39;d gone shopping and was calling to tell him there was a pretty dress I saw that I&#39;d love him to get for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been?&#34; His question stunned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d expected him to ask questions like &#39;where are you? Who helped you escape? Why did you kill my mother? Why don&#39;t you come back and give yourself in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not for a moment didI think my well-being would be his first question. Tears streaked my face. It was my Jaris. Gods, I&#39;ve missed him so much. I&#39;ve missed him just like I missed my peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I broke into tears. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I hurt you, Jaris. I&#39;m sorry I ruined our relationship. I didn&#39;t... I didn&#39;t mean to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mourned for a significant stretch. &#34;I didn&#39;t do it. I know you won&#39;t believe me, but I&#39;d never hurt you this way, Jaris. I&#39;d never hurt your mother. But it&#39;s fine if you still think I did. After all, you need someone to blame, and I&#39;m... I&#39;m ready to take the fall for it. I just...&#34; I sniffled. &#34;I just miss you so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was silent for some time, but it was as though I could hear and see him. How he&#39;d have pulled me into a hug and told me he believed me. How he&#39;d have scolded me for blaming myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I miss my Jaris. The one I&#39;d grown to love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34; He asked after sometime, his voice laced with something I couldn&#39;t quite place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was conflicted. How was I supposed to give him my location when he was hunting me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come alone. I give you my wvord.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to do the trick. If I had to die truusting Jaris, I&#39;d definitely die smiling. After all, there was nothing to fight for anymore. And it wouldn&#39;t be bad if I get to see him one last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE:</p>
