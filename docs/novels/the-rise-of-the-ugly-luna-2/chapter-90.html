                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay...why was he sweet with the kids and not with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting the strep of my bag over my shoulder, I went after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The inside was more beautiful than I imagined with a black theme.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to imagine the amount of money that must have been put into this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued walking behind Jace until we reached an office. Oh. So, he had a home office here as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; His voice was icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold his stare and was forced to lower mine to the floor. He didn&#39;t look like the man that had been happy to see his kids a while ago. &#34;I asked a question,&#34; he clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck this,Lyric. Stop showing him your weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kids wanted to see you.&#34; My voice came out stronger, my eyes snapping to meet his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came here for a purpose. To be alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Well, I&#39;m sorry, but you heard them.They were worried about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you think it is in your right to be the one to bring them to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words touched a nerve.&#34;Marta wasn&#39;t home. And maybe if you were taking their calls, this wouldn&#39;t have happened. I understand that you&#39;re angry and all, but you shouldn&#39;t take it out on the kids. They don&#39;t deserve this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop trying to lecture me. You know nothing!&#34;He yelled at me, making me yelp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear and hurt ran through me. I was only trying to help.What exactly was my offense!? I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I gritted. &#34;It was a mistake coming here.I&#39;ll just take them and leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it. Stop right there!&#34; He sounded less angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to stop moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag.1didn&#39;t turn around to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know me, Lyric.&#34; He was calmer now but sounded frustrated. &#34;I love them. The last thing l want to do is ignore them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him, and the look in his face made me worried. For the first time, I saw beyond his ruthlessness and grumpiness. No, he didn&#39;t look like any of that right now. Right now, he appeared very sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been through a lot of shit, you know? But paternity fraud has never been one of them. And it&#39;s never been something I thought I&#39;d get from Marta.&#34;He brushed his fingers through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When the twins came, I felt beyond happy. They&#39;re the most important to me. Getting to learn that they might not actually be mine... I have the right to be fucking upset, Lyric. And I don&#39;t want to be alone because I&#39;m avoiding them. I want to be alone because I don&#39;t even know how to deal with them right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;You handled them pretty well out there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could barely try,&#34; he scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned against his table, pinching the bride of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t wanna hurt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Seeing Alpha Jaris like this was actually a rare sight. It was quite sad too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was speechless. I didn&#39;t want to say anything that&#39;d make things worse. &#34;T-The kids don&#39;t even need you to do much. They just want to be around you-that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Alpha. Until the test is done, they&#39;re still your kids at least. Don&#39;t do this to them when they know nothing about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swept his hand over his face, and he was back-the mean,ruthless Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed away from the table, walked past me and out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a deep breath before going after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Jaris heeded my advise and tried to act naturally around the kids. Mrs. Reyes-who I got to know was the house help and had been the one taking care of the house even when he was away-already made dinner and served the table for all of us. The kids joked about their birthday choices at the table. Xyla was a talkative and would argue for minutes whenever her brother countered one of her ideas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed at the sight of Jaris laughing a few times when the kids said or did something funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was surprised when Mrs. Reyes came down and said she was leaving. I&#39;d thought she&#39;d be sleeping in or something. Jaris meant it when he said he wanted to be alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids,however, had a different plan in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we sleep over, daddy?&#34; It was Xylon who asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Tomorrow&#39;s weekend, daddy. We don&#39;t have no school! We could sleep!&#34; Xyla was ecstatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I love the vacation home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced up at Jaris, and at the same time, he was staring at me. The kids looked too happy and hopeful.How would he turn them down like this? &#34;Of course. This is our home.&#34; His smnile did not quite reach his eyes. I had a feeling the statement &#39;our home&#39; must have gotten to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;d stop being their home when the DNA result comes out in a couple of days and the kids turn out not his. I was so afraid of him hating them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ye!!!&#34; Xyla jumped on her feet. &#34;Thank you,daddy!&#34;She touched my hand on the table. &#34;You should stay,aunty.Stay!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I withdrew my hand from hers. &#34;N-Not at all, darling.I&#39;ll just leave after this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can stay if you want.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze.It was Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our eyes locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are a lot of rooms here. If the kids want you around...&#34; He shrugged.</p>
