                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened like saucers, shock sizzling through me. What in Moon&#39;s name has Marta done to these kids?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should know you&#39;re special to me. If I had even the slightest idea that your daddy was supposed to go somewhere with you two, I never would&#39;ve let him stay with me. I promise I didn&#39;t know. I&#39;d never do anything to hurt you two.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t believe you,&#34; Xyla folded her hands with a huff. &#34;All this time, we thought you were good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Xylon&#39;s hand, she walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of going after them but was too weak to.Too heartbroken. What exactly did I do to deserve this? JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My forehead crinkled in a fusion of disbelief and irritation as I read through the letter. It was the second one I was reading concerning this very matter, and the shock that filled me up could not be compared to nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the letter when I finished and looked up at Kael to see he was just as disturbed as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This real? There was really a fight between them?&#34;|asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A very serious one. One of the guards ended up dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the late King&#39;s death, there had been some kind of arguments going on with few of the Alphas that we didn&#39;t know about. The news was just getting to me now that I became King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, they have been disagreeing over certain things, and last night, two Alphas-one from the lower ranks and one from the higher ranks-got into a messy fight. One of their guards ended up dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t new for Alphas to disagree, but getting into an actual fight that drew the attention of everyone,as well as someone ending up dead, it&#39;d gotten really serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second letter I&#39;d just finished reading was another Alpha from the low ranks complaining about the fight and how wrong the high ranking Alpha was.I didn&#39;t like how it was looking so far. Something needed to be done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Send a message out to all of them,&#34; I told Kael. &#34;I want a meeting held this evening.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I waited for the meeting and handled other things, Lyric returned from her movie with Maddy.Her eyes were sore like she&#39;d been crying, making me wonder how tragic the movie was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, she opened up to me and I knew it had nothing to do with the movie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in disbelief when she told me about the kids having issues with her of late. She talked about them being pissed and accusing her of ruining our outing the previous night. I thought Lyric and the kids were always going to be good. What changed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She started crying so hard as she narrated everything to me. It drove me insane to know Marta had obviously poisoned their minds. I was on the verge of sending for her but was held back by Lyric who wouldn&#39;t let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,I consoled her instead, promising to speak to the kids later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas arrived promptly for the meeting. I made sure everyone was seated in the hall before I made my entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never felt more animosity between the Alphas like the one I felt as I made my way to my seats. Most of them were glaring at each other, like they wanted nothing more than to claw their nails at their throats. And the worst part? It was between the higher and lower Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time there would be this sort of issue between the two ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my seat, addressed them for coming and proceeded to call out the two Alphas involved in the fight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to explain why your misunderstanding has gotten to the point of someone dying?&#34; From my voice, I let them know there would be repercussions for what they&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha from the lower ranks-Jaxen-went first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That son of a mongrel has been biting more than he can chew,&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the way the referred Alpha grounded his teeth. &#34;I&#39;m sure every one of you is aware that one of my many successes is my second company-Aura House. My father purchased that company when his father abandoned it. My father made Aura House what it is today. Aura House had become so successful and was passed onto me which of course, I&#39;ve been doing a great job like my father. Suddenly, this mongrel came from nowhere and has been insisting on repurchasing it. According to him, his father was foolish for selling it out in the first place, he thinks it&#39;s his birthright, and foolishly thinks he will handle it better than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, of course, I turned down his offer, and the asshole had the guts to threaten me by saying shit like he&#39;s from a high rank, hence,he has the authority to revoke a sale made by his family.What the hell?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back in my seat as the other Alphas weighed in on the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he&#39;s not exactly lying,&#34; another Alpha from a high rank said. &#34;As a high-ranking Alpha, he could actually revoke a sale. At least, he&#39;s promising to refund you triple of the money your father has paid for the purchase.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, and reap off everything I&#39;d worked so hard for? Not even in your fucking dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched my brows as the argument rose. Honestly, I didn&#39;t know what our forefathers were thinking when they made these stupid rules between the two ranks.They were so obsessed with power that even as Alphas, they still wanted some of the Alphas beneath them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, a high-ranking Alpha had the right to revoke a sale, but it didn&#39;t make sense for Jaxon to hand over the company he&#39;s worked so hard for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d planned on slowly demolishing the ranks over time, but with this issue on ground, I honestly didn&#39;t know what to do right now. Who was I to support?</p>
