                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After long hours of research, I managed to come up with something I could substitute for Jaris. Although,there was no guarantee it would work, I was hoping it would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was evening when I finished making the tea and proceeded to his office to give it to him. It was insane that he was always working even when he was in the Pack. It made me wonder if he had any resting time at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked repeatedly on the door of his office but got no response. Looked like he wasn&#39;t in. But I&#39;d already told him I&#39;d be bringing the tea later on. So, maybe I could just go in and leave this for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into the office and carefully placed the tea on the very messy-looking table. I wondered what he was always researching on that made his table always look like a warzone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I do hope that this tea gets to work a little. It&#39;d save me a lot of embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about turning away to leave when something else on the table caught my attention. It was a photo,turned upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had no business checking it out. I had no business wanting to know who it was. Yet, there was a stubborn pull between myself and the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chomped down on my lower lip and quickly, picked it up. Breath alipperr away from my lungs in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, wondering if my eyes were deceiving me.What in Hades!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was me. My old self; clearly from a CCTV footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head swam with the information. It was from that day I&#39;d been leaving his hotel. What was it doing here?Why did Jaris have it with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The new discovery gave me sleepless night and I kept wondering; should I tell Jaris the truth? That I was the same girl from the hotel? What difference would it make? He abandoned me. Wasn&#39;t it obvious he wanted nothing to do with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why would he have my old picture with him? It didn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, I was super nervous when he summoned me to his office. I wasn&#39;t sure I could see him right now, but I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went in and found him talking with Kael and Nerion while busily arranging some files. I stood by the door and waited for some minutes until he finished with the two men and asked them to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning.&#34; My head was dipped, my eyes on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; His tone was abrupt. &#34;I got the tea last night. But I didn&#39;t feel a thing when I took it. None of the reactions you said I&#39;d get actually happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip, still avoiding his gaze. &#34;I um... I&#39;m sorry.I thought it&#39;d-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure it was your best you gave?&#34; He asked me with those accessing eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uh...nope.Not even close to my best. It was just a random remedy that I was hoping would work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll come up with something else,&#34; I muttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ノ</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a prolonged silence. It became uncomfortable I hadto look up at him. And there he was,watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you hiding from me?&#34; He asked suspiciously. &#34;It seems you know something else that can help but don&#39;t want to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tongue-tied. He finally suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper. Tell me the truth. You know I hate disobedience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. But if I did, he&#39;d want me to carry out the process on him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. I was fucked. I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;1-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was interrupted by his phone ringing. He received the call and frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did this happen? Yes, I&#39;ll be there soon.&#34; He grabbed his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,thank goodness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with relief as he started toward the door. Well, if it wasn&#39;t the most relieving moment of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ended the call and glanced at me. &#34;We&#39;ll finish this when I get back.&#34; Then,he was out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least, we had hours until evening. It was enough time to prepare myself for what was to come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the day, when the kids got back from school, I made Xylon some of his tea and performed a therapy on him. By the time I finished, he was deep asleep on my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as Istared into his sleeping face. Xyla was busy, playing with her tab nearby and paid no attention to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,cute things. As much as I loved them, my heart ached each time I saw them, because they reminded me of the ones I&#39;d lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My own babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only they were alive, they&#39;d have been around the same age as Xylon and Xyla. I was sure they&#39;d have been pretty too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty, are you okay?&#34; Xyla asked. It wasn&#39;t until that moment that I realized I&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I smiled, sniffed and wiped the lone tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>**+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was still not back by evening. He must have a busy day at the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was bored and decided I&#39;d freshen up and take a walk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my shower and took down my towel so I could apply some lotion. And in that very momnent, the craziest thing happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My door suddenly swung open, causing me to scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand reached for my towel on the bed, same time my eyes darted to the door to see who the hell had come in.I really hoped it was one of the maids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was I kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because right there, standing in the doorway, brows drawn, was Jaris Dreadmoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
