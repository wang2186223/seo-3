                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept off in Jaris&#39; arms. But even in my sleep,I still didn&#39;t find peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was alone and sad in my dream, with the whole world being against me. It made me so afraid when I woke up to someone knocking on my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around to an empty bed. Jaris must&#39;ve left when I fell asleep. Afterall, this night was supposed to be busy for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock came again. I left the bed but was too scared to go closer to know who was knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re in there, Lyric. Open this door. We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Luna Isolde.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Convincing myself that she couldn&#39;t harm me, l decided to listen to her. Jaris must&#39;ve locked the door from outside, but I found an extra key on the table and unlocked the door with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself staring straight at the furious Luna who looked like she was ready to slaughter me. Why did it take you so long to open the door?&#34; She growled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I was sleeping.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at me from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Luna,&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened with you and Jaris? What did you tell him in private?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes down and said nothing.I had a nagging headache that wouldn&#39;t go away and wish I didn&#39;t have to go through this now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking to you, Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s private. But...he said he&#39;d address the issue soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Private, huh?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;You know, I&#39;ve always had a bad feeling about you. And I do hope you realize that I&#39;m not going to take it lightly with you if you get in the way of my son&#39;s throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped closer to me. &#34;I am his mother.And the responsibility of a mother is to eliminate any danger in her child&#39;s way. If you were a mother, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have understood better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared up at her and wondered what she&#39;d do if she knew | was pregnant with her grandchild.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, take this as a warning, Lyric. You better not be an obstacle in my son&#39;s way. This whole arrangement was contractual, and in a few months, you&#39;re expected to be out. But I wouldn&#39;t mind to kick you out before then if you try to ruin things for us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes to take a deep breath before talking to her. &#34;With all due respect, Luna Isolde, I never want to ruin things for Jaris. I want the best for him, and you may not know it, but I&#39;ve played a major role in getting him to his current position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like hell you have,&#34; she scoffed. &#34;I hope I don&#39;t get to speak on this matter again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my relief,she left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The original plan had been to move in from Darkspire to the Silver Citadel. But with everything happening now, I didn&#39;t know how that would go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t tell Jaris about his mother&#39;s confrontation when he returned later at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too scared to even step out of the room and see people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The morning was still very young and Jaris was making numerous phone calls while I stood by the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place looked scantier as all the guests from last night had dispersed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I became surprised when I noticed numerous cars driving in endlessly. When the occupants came out of the backseat, it turned out to be different Alphas. Why were so many Alphas here today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Is there something happening today?&#34; | directed at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say anything about holding a meeting with all the Alphas as we were supposed to be moving in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Why?&#34; He was on a call but pulled the phone away slightly to ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, they&#39;re here. A lot on them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He joined me at the window to confirm what I was saying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he did, someone knocked on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed the guard that had come to get me from the room. I already had a good guess on why the Alphas were here. It was making me run mad, but I had to force myself to remain calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the hall where all the Alphas, the Chairman,the Elders, and of course, the Executioners were seated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They rose and bowed their heads the moment l walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used to think I&#39;d always love that title. Butright now,it filled me with nothing but disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s every one of you gathered here?&#34; | demanded coldly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Cole that answered. &#34;We have a pressing issue on ground, Your Highness. We hope you don&#39;t mind.Yesterday,you said you couldn&#39;t deal with the issue of the Siphon because it was your coronation party which we very much understood. It&#39;s a new day today, and we were hoping-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you summoned all my Alphas for a meeting without my permission and knowledge?&#34; I cut him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not at all. We simply relayed to them that there might be a Siphon in our midst. And out of curiosity and concern for their Packs, they came running.&#34; His smart response only made me want to rip his heart out.Unfortunately, I was King now. There were certain things I couldn&#39;t do anymore as I needed to live by example.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; Chairman Lyon started calmly. &#34;I have known Lyric longer than you have. She grew up being my son&#39;s best friend, and believe me, I more than anyone else knows how sweet and kind hearted she is.It&#39;s also hard to think she&#39;s a danger to us. But this is a very serious issue, you know? We need her here for questioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced around before saying his next words. &#34;You more than anyone in this room should understand how dangerous Siphons are. Your forefather experienced their wickedness first hand, and till date, your family still bears the consequences. So,please, we need Lyric here for questioning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt all eyes on me as I walked into the hall. I felt like the weak one amongst them; a woman walking into the midst of very dangerous men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help feeling like a prey entering into a trap.I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do this if Jaris wasn&#39;t here, keeping his eyes on me like everyone else. While the other Alphas and Elders looked at me with caution,the Executioners had a different look entirely.They stared at me as though I was a plaque who they couldn&#39;t wait to get rid of. The hate in their eyes was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood beside Jaris, just as he&#39;d requested me to in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairman Lyon did the talking. After the customary greetings and all, he pleaded with me to be honest with the Executioners, then he handed me over to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was asking a question last night before you were taken away,&#34; Cole began. &#34;Did you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am a Siphon,&#34; I cut him off, reflecting the fierce rip of my heart from its place.</p>
