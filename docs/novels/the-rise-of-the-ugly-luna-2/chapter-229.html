                <p>I alerted Kael as soon as I could, and the search for Jaris began. Though I stayed out of their sight to avoid being seen by people who wanted me dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had already been released by the Executioners and was undergoing treatment at his father&#39;s place. I wished I could see him, but even I knew that was far from possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave Kael and Nerion the location of Caden&#39;s Mansion. Just like he said, he wasn&#39;t there when they arrived.None of his men were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They continued searching all through the city. But until a week later, there was still no hope. And the war had only grown worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Packs were turning on themselves in very brutal ways with no one to control them. Strangely, the lower ranks seemed to be winning, which was something I couldn&#39;t understand. It was crazy how this had slowly turned into a fight between the higher and lower ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people were growing increasingly violent.Buildings were being burnt, families were being attacked and killed, those who had once been friends were now foes. There was chaos everywhere in the world. And as the day went by, an imaginary line was drawn between the high-ranking wolves and the low-ranks. People from the Higher ranks did no longer go to the low ranks because there was a high chance of them being attacked, and vice versa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They needed their King. His absence was starting to raise a lot of angry questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the search had lasted for two weeks, even Kael had gotten frustrated and demanded to meet with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been hiding low in an abandoned cottage that I found somewhere in the woods. Kael had been kind enough to help me with some money when I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, as I watched him approach me in the cottage, he didn&#39;t seem toocalm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How exactly was he taken?&#34; There was a rough edge to his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I told you. Caden shot him an arrow poisoned with my blood, and he passed out in an instant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your blood,&#34; he chuckled, nodding his head. &#34;And Caden didn&#39;t say anything about giving him back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my head, not feeling the need to tell him he wanted me in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, my silence was suspicious enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you know something, Lyric, you better start talking. What the fuck did Caden say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t say anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that wasn&#39;t the expression you gave off just now. Our people are dying daily, Lyric! What do you think Jaris would do to himself when he returns and sees everything destroyed? How do you expect him to cope with himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to back him, burying my face in my palms. Behind me, he continued talking about the chaos happening and how important it was that the King was around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. And I hated the fact that he was. The only way to get Jaris back was to completely let him go. I wasn&#39;t ready to do that. Even he wouldn&#39;t want that for any reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael came closer to me, his voice filled with more rage. &#34;What did Caden tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A helpless tear slipped down my cheek. I sniffled and wiped it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wants me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confused, Kael didn&#39;t say anything immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the only way he&#39;ll give Jaris back. He wants me to work for him and...and belong to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kael still remained silent, I turned around to face him. He looked as confused as I expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve just been as confused, Kael. I thought maybe... maybe we&#39;d find him. I also want Jaris back, but not at the expense of losing him. I don&#39;t want to.&#34; Slowly, Kael walked over to the window, staring outside. I knew he was anything but amused at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The people need their King, Lyric,&#34; he said after a while. &#34;This is all messed up, but I know Caden. If he says he&#39;lI do something, that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s going to do. He won&#39;t release Jaris until you give him what he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked. &#34;Well, in this case, he wants me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And maybe we should give him what he wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to digest the meaning of what he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to give myself to Caden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Lyric. I just know that I&#39;m tired of seeing my friend get hurt all the damn time!&#34; He turned around to face me. &#34;No offense, but for the past few months since I met you, Jaris is always in one mess or the other. And most of the time, it has to do with you. He can&#39;t even be King right now after fighting for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But how&#39;s that my fault? His brother is the one causing all of this havoc.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. And who exactly Siphoned his brother awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened but no words formed. That was how I knew he&#39;d actually gotten me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around, pinching my brows and trying so hard to fight back the tears already building up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings, Lyric, but this is what happens when you&#39;re with someone you&#39;re not fated to. It&#39;s always as if nature is fighting against you. Sometimes, the best thing to do is let each other go.So, maybe going to Caden isn&#39;t such a bad idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke into tears, unable to face him again. He was right; though it didn&#39;t stop the truthfrom being less painful. The truth that I was only going to be a tool to Caden-to be with a man I wish I didn&#39;t have to be with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do it, Lyric. For everyone&#39;s sanity. Please,&#34;. Kael spoke some more to my conscience from behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t look at him until I heard his retreating footsteps. I stayed up long enough for everything to sink in. As hard as it was, I had to accept the truth that Jaris was probably better off without me. He&#39;d finally be a good King who wouldn&#39;t have to make biased decisions for my sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was ready to accept my fate. But before then, there was one last thing I must do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Marta. Twice before she picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cleared her throat. &#34;Lyric. Can I know why you&#39;re calling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to see my kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She huffed. &#34;You seriously want to go ahead with your plan of-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I only wish to see them one last time, Marta. As their mother, I believe I have the right to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a slight pause. &#34;You say one last time like you&#39;re about to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is none of your concern. Just bring my kids to me. I&#39;ll text you the time and address.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her pace. &#34;Lyric, it&#39;s not safe. Everyone is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone is too busy right now looking for the King. So, stop with the silly excuses and let me see my kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! They&#39;re &#39;my&#39; kids, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, shut up, Marta. The only reason I&#39;m still letting you keep them is because I care about Xyla&#39;s relationship with her father. It is my responsibility as her mother to make these decisions. You, MMarta,will never be their mother. You&#39;ll never even be a mother at all if you keep up with your disgusting attitude. So,let that sink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, pleased at her loss of words. &#34;Now, like I said, I&#39;ll text you the time and address. Bring my kids and don&#39;t be late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the call.</p>
