                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My day at TCH was going fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had surgery in two hours, but before then, I was excited to see Xylon who had come for his monthly check up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my client&#39;s file in my hand and examined it as l headed to Xylon&#39;s room. It was the patient I&#39;d be performing surgery on in a couple of hours. There was a lot I had to catch up on in his file.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, aunty!&#34; Xyla&#39;s sweet voice reached my ears from the bed when I walked into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran into me before I even got the chance to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, baby,&#34; I laughed, patting her on the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my eyes to look for Xylon and my smile dropped, sinking low into my stomach in a way that hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands dropped to my sides, my eyes quickly darting to the floor. No one had mentioned he was here. I didn&#39;t brace myself for it.&#34;G...Good morning.&#34; I&#39;d never dipped my head so clumsily before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric,please.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike me who was suddenly flustered, Jaris was effortlessly calm as he sat on the edge of the bed,next to Xylon whose vitals were being checked by a nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; He gave a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to look at him but failed. I&#39;d never been so nervous around Jaris. What was wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dream chose the wrong time to crash on me.Suddenly, seeing him in the room made it feel more real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Touching me.Kissing me.Making me feel good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, aunty?&#34; Sweet Xyla asked, snapping me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, darling. I was just calculating something,&#34;I stroked her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; eyes were on me. I wasn&#39;t staring at him, but I could feel his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coughing to clear the lump in my throat, I moved forward,going to meet Xylon. Unfortunately,however,it brought me closer to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did my best to ignore the fact that we were in close proximity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re you doing, boy?&#34; I tickled his ear, making him giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, his giggles were the cutest thing! How could one child be so adorable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chat a little with the kids until Xylon&#39;s checkup was done. I asked the nurse how he was and got a positive feedback from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever I was doing with him at home was working.I had to keep it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my hand wrapped around XyLa&#39;s shoulder as we walked out of the room, Xylon and his father behind us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. I have to get back to work. See you soon?&#34;|dropped to a crouch before the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We could play Charades!&#34; Xyla said excitedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Charades was a new game we had grown to love. &#34;Sure! Get ready to cry &#39;cause I&#39;ll be winning today,&#34; I teased her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xyla and I...won you the last time.&#34; Xylon answered,melting my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rarely spoke that when he did, it was a pleasure getting to hear him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse showed up behind me. &#34;Excuse, ma&#39;am.Your attention is needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bleed to her before turning back to the kids. &#34;So,make sure you&#39;re good.See you soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I turned to leave, I made the mistake of glancing at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, I shouldn&#39;t have done that, because my body did that stupid thing where it reacted to my dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also caught a glimpse of amusement in his face.He must be surprised that I was so good with the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,even me was surprised. And it hurt me to know I&#39;d have been a good mother had my own kids been alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was thirty minutes to the surgery. I was walking alongside an assisting doctor, headed to the surgical ward while we both went through the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My steps came to a sudden pause when I found an unpleasant sight before me. It wasn&#39;t supposed to be unpleasant, yet I felt this twinge in my guts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before me, Marta, Jaris and the kids walked,heading toward the exit. Marta was talking to Jaris. I couldn&#39;t make out what was being said, but Jaris listened to her attentively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stopped at the revolving doors, and to my horror, Marta lifted her hands to his collars, arranging it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did that in public! In front of so many people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was backing me, so I couldn&#39;t seehis reaction.But it must be something she was used to, otherwise,she wouldn&#39;t do it in public.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The agony took a jab at my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, so many eyes were on me, including the doctor standing beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The situation was awkward. I, his mate,was standing aside while another woman fixed his collar for everyone to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,she wasn&#39;t just any woman. She was the mother of his kids! What was wrong with me? Like everyone else, Marta&#39;s eyes locked on mine.I expected the victorious smile that spread on her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris lowered her hands from his shirt, then walked out the door with the kids. He didn&#39;t even turn for one second to look around. He probably had no idea I&#39;d seen that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The damage had already been done,coming with the painful realization that Marta was more important to Jaris than I was. Even on the night we got mated, he spent it with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, it was I who wouldn&#39;t stop having these stupid dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Lyric? We should get going.&#34; The young doctor beside me brought me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked rapidly, shaking the thoughts off.</p>
