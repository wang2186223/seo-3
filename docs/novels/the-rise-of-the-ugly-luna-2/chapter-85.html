                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sunlight streamed through the window, resting on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stirred awake from the discomfort, turning away from the sunlight and yawning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head was a little light. It took a moment longer for the memory to flood in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only this time...there was no memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slept peacefully through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t come. Nobody made love to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the side of the bed, I found the pill there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair, completely down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dream didn&#39;t happen because I didn&#39;t take the pill. Did this mean all the memories truly did happen in my dream? None of it was physical?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so disoriented that even Jace noticed while l was having lunch with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need a bigger spoon to turn your meal with?I could get one from the kitchen, you know?&#34; He taunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, snapping out of my thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m serious, Ly. For the past one minute, that&#39;s all you&#39;ve been doing on this table. Now, are you gonna tell me what the hell is wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally took a bite from my fries. It was tasteless on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t blame myself for not eating when my mind was plagued by these sex dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried some more to get it out of me, but there was no way I was admitting to him that I&#39;d been having sex dreams of a man who disliked me. It was too embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When are we telling the truth about the kids?&#34; He asked a while later when he&#39;s given up on trying to get my problems out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here we go. Another problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-We just need time.&#34; I stabbed the mushroom with my fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time? Okay, how long sweetie? Five more years to match the kids&#39; age? Or maybe we should wait until they&#39;re of legal age. That&#39;ll make it better won&#39;t it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand that you love the kids. Trust me, I could never mean harm to those cute little things. But we&#39;re talking about deceit, Lyric. Even they are being deceived into thinking they&#39;re with their family.Have you thought for once that their real family might be out there, mourning their loss? Marta must know where they come from. Wouldn&#39;t you want them to be reunited with their loved ones?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, he did hit a sensitive spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I very well knew how much it hurt to lose a child. The children&#39;s parents might have been mourning their loss. Unless, they willingly gave the twins out. But we might never know if we don&#39;t try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just felt really bad for Xyla and Xylon. Their lives could take a drastic turn. Even Jaris might never forgive Marta. And worse, what if he grows to hate the kids? That man could be very unpredictable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; I murmured, staring down at my plate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should tell the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness, Lyric. Are you crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my gaze from my plate and realized I was. Oh,what is wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, even Jace had a hard time choosing a date to reveal the truth. But we concluded we&#39;d get it done within the week,at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After lunch with him, I went for my appointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on a day off at TCH which was why I had the luxury of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into Nivia&#39;s room and was warmly welcomed by her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nivia was one of the best psychological doctors.I was never really a fan of her type, but at this point,I didn&#39;t have a choice. I feared I&#39;d lose my mind if l didn&#39;t get to understand what was wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She offered me some tea and made me give her a brief history of what the problem was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me all about it, dear. How did you meet this man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the space between my legs as I spoke.&#34;Five years ago. He took care of me when no one else did. It was just one night,&#34; a smile tugged at my lips. &#34;But it was the best night I&#39;d ever had.&#34; The memory was still very fresh like it happened yesterday. I still think of the very moment Jaris had taken off his mask and get goosebumps. And the magicaI moment he took mine off and called me &#39;Princess&#39; when I&#39;d expected him to mock me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he hurt you.&#34; Nivia probed, her eyes studying me. &#34;Didn&#39;t he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear slid down my cheek as I nodded. &#34;He fixed me,then broke me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, darling. Keep going. Now, you two met again and you think you&#39;re still in love with him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question prompted me to hesitate and reflect.Was I still in love with Jaris wvhen I saw him again after five years?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to remember my reaction the first day we met at his Pack. Of course, what was I saying? I&#39;d been in love with Jaris every single day for the past five years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched his lives grow inside me. I spent everyday wishing and hoping he&#39;d find me. He never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,&#34; I whimpered. &#34;I still do. But he doesn&#39;t love me anymore.He keeps hurting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nivia nodded, scribbling down in her book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And now,&#34; I sniffled. &#34;I keep having these dreams of him. They wouldn&#39;t stop. I don&#39;t even know what to do anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of dreams?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nervously Fiddled with my fingers. &#34;S-Sex dreams.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nivia took down more notes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wake up, feeling like it was real. Like I could still feel his touch on mne. I don&#39;t know what is wrong with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nivia was silent for a while as she took in more note in her book. When she finally looked up at me again,she had an opinion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Darling, I think you&#39;re truly obsessed with this man.It&#39;s the only reason you&#39;d be having these dreams of him.Have you considered telling him how you feel?&#34;Huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since I walked in, I laughed genuinely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tell Jaris Dreadmoor how I felt? Not even if I get the instruction from the Moon goddess herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not possible.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;Both of us...we are always at a disagreement. I think we were cursed never to be together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt better by the time I left Nivia&#39;s place. She tried to convince me to open up to &#39;him&#39; about how I felt,but in the end, I refused. There was no telling what Jaris would do to me if he gets to know I liked him.Our issues were probably going to escalate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She also advised me to find a distraction so I could stop thinking of him. She advised me to hang out with friends, see a movie, read books. Just anything to take my mind off it. I thought I&#39;d give it a try.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when night came and I was alone in my room, I stared at the pack of pills in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe the first step to healing would be to flush these down the toilet. But a strange part of me couldn&#39;t bring myself to do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I let go of the tiniest part I had or Jaris?These pills might be a mystery, but at least,they helped me satisfy some of my fantasies. Wouldn&#39;t it be foolish to just let it go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, none of it was real. I&#39;d never do this physically with Jaris. It was all a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking one out of the pack, I popped it in my mouth,and like the first time, the sensation came. I was at the brink of consciousness, aware of my surroundings but still not aware at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He touched me and made love to me in one of the sweetest ways.Made me feel so good. How could I ever stop having these dreams of Jaris Dreadmoor?</p>
