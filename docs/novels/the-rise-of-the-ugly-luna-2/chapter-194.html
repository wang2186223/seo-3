                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three months, I&#39;d been blinded by the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even now, it was staring at me right in the face,yet I was too hopeful to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she stuttering? Why was she crying so hard?Talking about not existing and all?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only guilty people act this way. And I&#39;d be doomed if Lyric was guilty-even though I brought her in here &#39;cause I suspected it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes rolled by. Staring at me, she could think I was being cold and not affected by any of this. She didn&#39;t know the inner demons I was fighting; how hard I was trying to pull myself together because I didn&#39;t want to believe she was truly guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you sorry for?&#34; | asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cries only grew worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t ask to be born this way, Jaris!&#34; Looking into my eyes,I could see the hurt and fear in them. It was killing. &#34;I didn&#39;t even know what I was until a few months ago. And when I did, I tried to run. I-I didn&#39;t want to endanger you or any of the people around.But you caught me,remember? You were so mad and had me locked up in the room. I didn&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Porcelain splintered in the depths of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That day, I&#39;d been curious to know why she attempted to leave. Even if she had been left with no choice but to follow the contract, I knew she wouldn&#39;t have wanted to flee so easily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Plus Xylon&#39;s health grew worse, and I knew I couldn&#39;t just leave him like that. This was the reason I stayed,even though I didn&#39;t want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes dropped to the floor as she explained in a shaky voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I w-won&#39;t even lie, I attempted to flee so many times.But every time, there was something holding me back.I didn&#39;t want to be here! I didn&#39;t ask for it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A peculiar pain yanked at my heart. Why did I feel betrayed at the thought that she had tried to flee me so many times? If she had managed to get away,none of these moments would&#39;ve existed between both of us-the moments that have summed up to make the best parts of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Executioner...&#34; Her tone became increasingly fearful talking about this. &#34;She approached me at the mall. I tried to dismiss her, but then she followed me to the party. She figured out who I was. I promise-&#34;she broke down some more. &#34;-I promise I didn&#39;t want to kill her. I just thought I could siphon her memories away. But it went wrong and she ended up dead instead. I was so-l was so scared, I tried to run again.But Caden caught me and I couldn&#39;t.&#34; She pulled at the roots of her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry, Jaris. I&#39;m so so sorry. I didn&#39;t even ask for any of this. Didn&#39;t want it to happen. I just-&#34; she laughed with tears in her eyes. &#34;I wish I could get rid of this stupid Siphon stuff. I don&#39;t even want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head as I backed away from her,the truth hitting real hard. I faced the window, my heart, for the first time in ages,running too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I bring her here to confess to me? It was seeming like the biggest mistake of my life because right now, I didn&#39;t know what to do with her,myself or this truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept sobbing behind me while I kept quiet for some minutes, processing everything in my head.From time to time, she chipped in how sorry she was for keeping the truth from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you ever...&#34; I turned around to face her.&#34;Siphoned me?&#34; A chuckle escaped her as she lowered her head.I realized it was pointless to ask in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, she had. It explained how she had been so good with Xylon. How her touch always seemed to have a different effect on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was only trying to help,&#34; she whispered. &#34;I didn&#39;t hurt any of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. She stared at me in surprise as I combed my fingers through my hair and laughed like I was in a comedy show.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s you!&#34; I pointed my palms toward her. &#34;From six years ago? The girl at the hotel?&#34; My face grew serious as I walked toward her. &#34;You&#39;re the scarred lady.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging from the guilt that clouded her face, it made me understand that she knew. All these months while we were together, she knew I was the man from the hotel. The one she had abandoned that morning.Yet,she said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How had she been able to play me into thinking she actually cared if she said nothing this whole time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You kept that a secret too?&#34; | asked with increased heartache &#34;Didn&#39;t think it was important enough to tell me?&#34; I backed away from her, dragging my eyes from her head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the hunts, she had been right in front of me this whole time and I had no idea. How did I not see it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scarred lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My &#39;Princess&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one I&#39;d spent five years searching for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps,that would explain why I felt this connection when I saw her for the first time in six years. She&#39;d always been the same person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s not what you think,&#34; she shook her head,sniffling. &#34;You didn&#39;t remember me.You were grumpy and didn&#39;t even like me. I didn&#39;t think there was any need to bring it up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she for real? How was I supposed to remember her when she was way different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different thought clicked in my head, infusing rage into my bones. &#34;You helped Caden escape!&#34; | hissed,going closer to her. &#34;You were the same Siphon!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No! I swear I didn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She broke into more tears as she narrated how it happened. Apparently, she had no idea she was a Siphon yet and didn&#39;t even know who Caden was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| was so mad at her, but I figured it made sense as l knew Caden wouldn&#39;t have just her if he knew she was the one that saved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet,everything was just fucked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door, then turned the knob.But it was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris!&#34; I recognized my mother&#39;s voice. &#34;What&#39;s going on there? They&#39;re waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric tried to stifle her whimpers. She was visibly shaking from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say a word until I heard my mother&#39;s retreating footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back to Lyric, I didn&#39;t know what to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you leave?&#34; Disappointment laced my words.&#34;We had an agreement. We were supposed to spend an extra day together. But you just vanished,and even after seeing me again, you didn&#39;t bother to reveal who you were.&#34; A dark numbing pain wrapped itself around my heart. &#34;Did you really want nothing to do with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows furrowed in confusion. &#34;I-I don&#39;tunderstand.&#34;She scoffed.&#34;You abandoned me. I mean, I woke up and you were gone. Y-You asked that man to get me to leave, telling her you didn&#39;t want to see me around when you did get back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;What man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The hotel attendant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face went blank. Something was definitely wrong here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to say something but was interrupted when they knocked on the door again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Jaris!&#34; This time it was Elder Lucas. &#34;The Executioners are getting impatient, and to be honest,so are we. Are you done with the Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric&#39;s fear appeared to intensify at the thought of what could happen to her. She knew she was in trouble, and honestly, I didn&#39;t know a way out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m scared,&#34; she admitted another truth tonight, her voice small and shaken. &#34;They&#39;re going to kill me. And...And while I was initially ready for it, I don&#39;t think I am anymore. I don&#39;t want to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand went to her belly. I didn&#39;t think she was aware that she was clutching it. &#34;My baby doesn&#39;t deserve to go through any of this.&#34; Gone was the rage in my heart. It was quickly replaced with the harsh reality that not just Lyric&#39;s life was in danger, but my child&#39;s as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something shifted inside my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The knock came again, more desperate than the first.I was King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris!&#34; She squeaked, taking a step toward me before she stopped herself. &#34;Please, don&#39;t let them in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused by the door, giving her a long stare. &#34;I won&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out the key from the keyhole, opened the door and locked the door when I was on the other side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody was getting into that room without me.And neither was Lyric getting the chance to leave.</p>
