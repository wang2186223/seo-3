                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, Father and I returned home to the Pack, as did every Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted and simply wanted a shower and a bath, but my sister had a way of getting in the way of my wants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was your stay in Blystara?&#34; She asked as I walked toward the door of my room. &#34;Ooh. Looks like you ran into a bit of trouble,&#34; she pointed at the patched part of my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It actually didn&#39;t hurt anymore. In a couple of days, the mark would be completely gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Nora. Just go, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t accompany us to the funeral as she had something very important to take care of. She had been somewhat depressed since Roderick started treating her like trash. But it really wvasn&#39;t my fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope the driver was really hard,&#34; she suddenly said when I was about to open my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait, what? I furrowed my horse as I looked at her. She was wearing a smug smile with her arms crossed over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, I did tell him to be reallý hard on you. I hope you felt every crushing pain for hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened like a startled deer caught in headlights. No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was you!?&#34; I stepped toward her, disbelief clouding my expression. &#34;You hired someone to do that to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She casually shrugged. &#34;I wasn&#39;t there, but I&#39;m sure it must&#39;ve hurt like a bitch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re sick! I&#39;ll make sure you pay for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really? How exactly? It&#39;s not like you have any evidence. Or do you really think Father wouuld believe l actually tried to hurt you?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;Go in and rest, Lyric. And keep watching your back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked away, leaving me brimming with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had gone to father to report the issue to him, but he was so busy with numerous calls I didn&#39;t get the chance to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to tell him later because there was no way I was letting the little witch get away with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a little better after showering and was taking a nap when a call woke me up. To my surprise, it was Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We both hadn&#39;t spoken since he dropped me off at my suite yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?G-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How fast can you get to Darkspire?&#34; He cut me off, sounding very urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remnants of sleep vanished from my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...&#34; I checked the time. &#34;I-I don&#39;t really know. It&#39;s-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you here, Lyric. Now. It&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I changed into a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and headed to Darkspire. Jaris didn&#39;t tell me what the problem was, and it made me even more anxious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching Darkspire, a maid was already waiting outside and led me to where Jaris was. It turned out to be the kids&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart shattered as a hint entered my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried into the room, and as expected, Xylon was shaking in bed. His sister was on the floor beside him,crying her eyes out, while Jaris sat on a chair next to the bed. Though he looked calm, I could see the worry in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood as soon as I entered. &#34;When I called, it wasn&#39;t this serious. What took you so long?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned at his tone. Why was he mad at me? I decided to brush it aside, realizing he was going through a lot of emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need a bowl of warm water, please. And some napkins,&#34; I said to no one in particular as I hurried to sit on the bed. Carefully, I placed his head on my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The maids in the room hurried to get what I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And some Cinnamon, if there&#39;s any available!&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon&#39;s skin was like hot coal. He was burning up and shaking terribly. Tears rimmed my eyes. I didn&#39;t want to start imagining how painful this must be for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, everything will be fine. I&#39;m here now. It&#39;s going to be fine.&#34; I spoke in hushed tones as I cradled his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Less than thirty minutes later, Xylon was completely fine and asleep on my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I stared into his face, my fingers lightly stroking his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so handsome when he looked this peaceful. My heart hurt for him. Jaris had mentioned him going through this since he was two. So, he had been suffering from this for three years. It was a horrible thing a child as cute and innocentas he had to endure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I carefully rested his head on a pillow and followed Jaris out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; he said with a slight furrow in his brow as we stood in the passage. His eyes were lowered to the floor as though he was contemplating something. &#34;I didn&#39;t entirely believe it when Xyla told me how quickly you had treated her brother the other day. It almost doesn&#39;t seem real.&#34; He met my gaze. &#34;How do you do it?&#34; I shrugged and sighed. &#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t even know how l do it. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m able to save people when l need it to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris nodded. &#34;It&#39;s a blessing, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, trust me; it&#39;s also a curse. They didn&#39;t know it, but this had gotten me into a lot of trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The date for the coronation ceremony had been fixed. It&#39;s happening in seven days,&#34; he said, distracting me a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, okay.&#34; I guess nothing would be getting in the way again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But what do you say about moving in before then? You&#39;re quite helpful being around Xylon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the door before nodding. I honestly didn&#39;t have an issue with it. If I could help the little boy in any way, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to jump at the offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it. I think it&#39;d be better if I move in today so I can commence full treatment on him tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened. Wow. Jaris Dreadmoor looked at me tenderly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that fleeting moment, I caught a glimpse of the man I&#39;d spent the night with five years ago. The man who had called me &#39;Princess&#39; when everyone else called me ugly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I appreciate that you&#39;re doing this for him. It doesn&#39;t go unnoticed.&#34; He said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm.Who would&#39;ve thought that Jaris could actually be polite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dipped my head and turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; He called, bringing me around to look at him. &#34;Could you be extra careful this week? You know,thécoronation is just around the corner. I wouldn&#39;t want anything ruining it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And... by being careful, you mean-don&#39;t go clubbing? Don&#39;t hang out with my male friend...&#34; I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. &#34;Those are really not the problem, Alpha Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do as I say and stop arguing.&#34; There was slight irritation in his voice. Woah. The old Jaris slipping through the cracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard you.&#34; As I turned to open the door, I rolled my eyes since he couldn&#39;t see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen anyone with her kind of healing skills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve watched Marta struggle to stop Xylon&#39;s epistles within hours. But right in front of me, Lyric used minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it also meant good news for Xylon. Hopefully, she&#39;d be able to treat him before the end of our year contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now...I actually hope she&#39;ll still be alive by then. She deserved to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion was waiting in my study room when I entered. He was leaning against my table, reading a newspaper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Welcome back, Boss. I trust Xylon is much better?&#34; He lowered the paper from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is. How is Kael and te task I assigned to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s doing great. Will be back any moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded and took my seat, taking out some documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I actually have information on the task you assigned.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the documents and focused on him. I was more interested in Lyric Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And... I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to like what I found.&#34;</p>
