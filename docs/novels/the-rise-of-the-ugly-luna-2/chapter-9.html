                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone else treated Xylon? How did that happen without my knowledge?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And was it really effective like Xyla claimed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon had been suffering from this for years. No one has been able to help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it?&#34; | asked, more interested than ever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, silly Xyla,&#34; Marta suddenly cut in, chuckling.&#34;Did you really have to call me someone else? You want it to be a surprise?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding a cup of what she had been mixing, she approached Xylon with it, urging him to drink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xyla just wants it to be a surprise, Jaris. I actually came up with a new formula, and thankfully, it worked. Right, Xyla?&#34; She offered a smile and touched Xyla&#39;s hair with tenderness. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go get some water for your brother,honey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla stood up and left without saying a word. She looked uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,it was you?&#34;|asked Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course. Who else would come into the kids&#39;room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense. No one would enter to treat Xylon without my permission. Besides, Marta was the head doctor at the Central Pack Hospital, and she had been working tirelessly to find a solution for Xylon&#39;s health. It was believable that she might be close to finding one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; she cleared her throat, folding her hands while her eyes dropped to the floor. &#34;I heard you had a guest today. Your future Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, that was it. I wasn&#39;t ready for another conversation that would get me into a worse mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not doing this, Marta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t I be enough for you and your mother?&#34;There was a crack in her voice. &#34;Come on, Jaris! I&#39;ve given you two kids. An heir! How do you and your mother despise me so much?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you from the onset that bearing these kids was not going to be enough to make you my Luna.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love my kids with every fiber of my being, but we didn&#39;t agree on them before you became pregnant, Marta. And I made it clear to you that I had no intention, whatsoever, of making you my Luna. So, quit trying to play the victim card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making someone like Marta my Luna would be a big mistake. She was vile, poorly mannered and hardly cared for others. While I was most of these things,I couldn&#39;t have a Luna that was just like me. Two monsters could not exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had actually been shocked when she took in. Like it was with every woman, I had not been able to finish with her. But then, it wasn&#39;t medically impossible for her to take in even without me coming. And it felt good to have the one thing I never thought I could  have. But it still wasn&#39;t enough to make someone like her my Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes became teary, and I knew I had to leave to avoid any more of her dramas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come to my room when you&#39;re free, okay?&#34; | said to Xylon who nodded happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me that his mother and I just had an inappropriate discussion in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tousling his hair, I left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here I was, thinking my new face could never be rejected.Apparently, Alpha Jaris was an exception.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It stung when his mother returned and told us the Alpha was busy but promised to get back to us.l didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me it was a polite way of saying &#34;he is not interested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, maybe it was a good thing, because I didn&#39;t</p>
                
                
                
                <p>think I was interested in him anymore. He was a liar,rude and arrogant. I didn&#39;t want to be with someone like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father was clearly disappointed. The entire ride home, he didn&#39;t say a word to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching home, Nora stormed toward me, looking furious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you have to take so long to come home?Roderick was here and ready to take you to the temple. But he got tired of waiting!&#34; She stomped her feet like the spoiled brat that she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tune it down, Nora. She was with me, don&#39;t forget,&#34;father said, putting a rein on her anger, though she rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;d better be home tomorrow. He&#39;ll be here again to take you to the temple.&#34; She huffed. &#34;I wish you were here to see how eager he was to end this silly thing with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am just as eager, Nora. You don&#39;t have to worry; l have no intentions of taking back something l rejected.&#34; I turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Drop the illusion, Lyric. He rejected you first.&#34; Nora&#39;s words wounded me, freezing me to the spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I felt the bitter reminder of a pain I&#39;d been trying to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without sparing her a glance, I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla and Xylon came over to spend some time with me when they were done with their mother. They simply played with their tabs while I focused on some tasks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the whole time, I noticed Xyla was unhappy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was their bedtime, one of their nannies came over to take them to the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled Xyla aside. &#34;Is something wrong?&#34;She remained silent, dropping her gaze to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you can tell me anything. Do you need something? Anything at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head. &#34;I am just worried about Xylon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid his crisis will return and no one will be around to help him. For the first time today, someone was able to treat him in minutes. It&#39;d be nice if she could be around more often to help him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone? &#34;Are you referring to mum?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, then glanced back at the door suspiciously. Xylon and the nanny were waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy told me not to tell you, but I&#39;m worried about Xylon. Mummy wasn&#39;t the one that had taken care of him today,&#34; she revealed, surprising me. &#34;It was one beautiful aunty. She had been wearing a red dress.&#34; Red dress. My thoughts spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on. Alpha Bennett&#39;s daughter!?</p>
