                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gaspoed, a light exhale escaping her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strong smell and taste of alcohol coated my tongue-Château Margaux,specifically. But other than that,she tasted mighty fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s just a taste.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand gripped the back of her head, pulling her up to meet my kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone who was drunk, she took it quite well.And fuck, it was beyond good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like a brainquake, shaking up my thoughts in the most exhilarating way</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s just a taste.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand flexed around her throat. If she wasn&#39;t so drunk, I&#39;d have choked her. But that wouldn&#39;t be too good now,would it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved the hand downward until I reached the hem of her dress. &#39;It&#39;s just a taste.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I couldn&#39;t stop my fingers when they moved beneath her dress, caressing bare skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away from her lips to mutter a &#39;fuck.&#39; Because that was exactly how I felt right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I wanted was a fucking taste of her lips, yetl couldn&#39;t get enough. Because Lyric&#39;s lips were fucking addictive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tasted like the first sip of warm cocoa on a winter&#39;s night, rich and comforting. It was a mental marvel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned deeply, throwing her arms around my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; Her voice was like a soft caress of sugar spun cotton, wrapping around me in warmth. Damn it. This woman was going to sound good in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surporise, she rocked her hips to meet mine. She was desperate for this. Desperate for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my fingers wander further beneath her dress.I reached her thigh-the thick soft flesh-and there was nothing I didn&#39;t do to resist giving it a tight squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end,I failed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released a breathy moan, her hand tightening around my shoulders. Had she been as horny for me like | was this whole time? This was a fucking discovery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I should stop this. Not because it was wrong-hell, I&#39;d never entirely care for right and went in my life-but because I shouldn&#39;t want her this way. Not after what she&#39;d done to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I let my fingers keep wondering, all the way to her underwear, until it was beneath it, too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exhaled slowly, throwing her head back.She may be drunk, but she was clearly enjoying this. And something about that fact just fueled my needs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scorching shivers raced across my flesh, sending heat radiating from head to toe when my fingers found her core. I froze for a moment, letting it sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was touching Lyric Harper. Intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric might not be the only one that&#39;d wake up to a change tomorrow. By morning, I&#39;ll ask myself what the fuck I just did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for now,however,I was lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a low growl as I rubbed against her clit while nuzzling my lips against her cheek. She was soaking</p>
                
                
                
                <p>wet!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was painfully hard. All I wanted was to pull out of my pants and claim Lyric right now, on this bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could think better of it, I thrust a finger into her. She gasped, a small startled thing</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet this wouldn&#39;t be her reaction if she was fully conscious right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whimpered, her chest rising and falling in a slow pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck,how was she so tight? She squeezed around my finger, her wetness coating me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sweat beaded my forehead as I imagined my dick replacing my finger. Imagine moving in a cunt this tight and wet. It&#39;d be pure bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I added another finger and fucked her, drawing small cries of pleasure from her. My eyes devoured her,all my nerves tingled to life, each one pulsating with vibrant energy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her lower lip between my teeth and bite. She whimpered and I sucked right on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did the same to her upper lip, then moved my lips to her throat where I kissed the hollows of her neck. &#39;Stop this, Jaris!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! It was too addictive!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pissed at the knowledge that I could do this all day. Nobody should have this effect on me. Nobody at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers dug into my back as her moans turned deeper. But they could hardly cause any harm considering the fact that I was wearing a shirt, and her moves were weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew she wasn&#39;t doing it to get me off her. Like me,the pleasure was too much for her to handle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please...&#34; she whimpered. &#34;Don&#39;t... stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recognized the sound of that. She was close to the top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was all the encouragement I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fastened my pace, rolling my thumb against her clit.In seconds, she exploded on my fingers, her cries loud enough to startle the shadows and make the night blush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My own breathing got harsher, and before I could hit the brakes on my impulses, I sank my teeth into her neck, giving her a small bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit, no! The realization struck me like lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t have done that. It&#39;d leave a mark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whimpered beneath me, coming down from her high.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I wrenched my fingers free, she took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was satiated. But I wasn&#39;t. No, I was far from it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted my cock to replace where my fingers had been. I wanted to feel her tight around me. I wanted to take her until she&#39;d have to beg me to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that would be going too far. Not because it was wrong. But because I didn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,despite how hard it was, I peeled myself off her,climbing off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; she breathed. She was more relaxed now,her body well spent. She&#39;d probably have to skip work tomorrow &#39;cause I wasn&#39;t sure she was waking up anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair. The weight of everything crashed on me at once. It wasn&#39;t just what I did but what I still wanted to do,and if I stayed here any longer, I feared I&#39;d really do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stomped out of the room. Kael was right there, and even if he didn&#39;t say the words, he gave me those judgy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored him and went to my room, slammed the door shut and hurried to the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t have done this. Not to Lyric. Not to the woman who had hurt and betrayed me when no one else would dare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My erection came into my hand. The image of her beneath me and at the mercy of my pleasure to filled my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, the vision was more potent. More detailed.All it took was four jerks and I came in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hissed, my hand holding onto the wall above me for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was nothing like I&#39;d felt before. The orgasm was explosive.</p>
