                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands itched to clutch the sides of my dress, but|forced them not to, following Jaris:l&#39; instructions. He told me not to do anything that would make me look nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall went dead silent, followed by their shocked expressions, then slow gasps and murmurs.I watched as they all exchanged glances at each other on the table,except for the Executioners who had their eyes solely on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a Siphon,&#34; Cole nodded, confirming the truth in my eyes. &#34;And you killed Lucy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed nervously on that fact. &#34;It was an accident.Never wanted to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You fucking killed Lucy and dared to call it an accident?&#34; One of the females growled, her teeth grinding together. &#34;Lucy was an amazing person. She didn&#39;t deserve to die like that!&#34; She was the Executioner that reminded me of Lucy, and it was the first time any of them was displaying an emotion other than the cold mask they&#39;re known for carrying.She and Lucy must&#39;ve had some sort of relationship. &#34;But I guess that is the thing with Siphons,&#34; another said, malice in her voice. &#34;They always kill people and blame it on the innocent word, &#39;mistake&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyes to the floor. It was getting harder by the second to keep my nervousness away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this the right idea? Was I right for listening to Jaris when he told me to stay back and confess to being a Siphon? It looked like everyone was against me. How am I getting out of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Jaris, have you known about this?&#34; Elder Lucas asked,disappointment hanging from his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only yesterday.&#34; Jaris&#39; tone was cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And...you didn&#39;t say anything?&#34; Another Alpha asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Instead, you dissolved the meeting and let a Siphon sleep in this same building with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris scoffed. &#34;Forgive me, what was I supposed to do?Gag her, chain her and drag her out to be slaughtered?You expect me to throw away all the memories we have for a truth I just recently discovered? If you can do that to your mates, then I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ve all been living with monsters but had no idea. Maybe I should send a letter to them, warning them to be careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your Highness,you know it&#39;s not that-&#34; &#34;You say I let her sleep in this same building like she hasn&#39;t been staying with me for months! Lyric has never been a threat to me or any member of my Pack!She didn&#39;t even know she was a Siphon until a few months ago. She didn&#39;t ask to be one!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A malformed fetus never asks to be conceived, King Jaris. Yet, their parents have to get rid of them because they know they&#39;re a mistake,&#34; Cole countered calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was starting to lose his composure.I could see it in the way his muscles were flexing into a harder grip.The last thing I wanted was watching him snap in front of his subjects. So, I reached for his hand to remind him I was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others couldn&#39;t see us as there was a big table in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; Chairman Lyon called. &#34;How did this happen to you, child? You should&#39;ve.... You should&#39;ve told someone about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is quite unfortunate she&#39;s been found guilty,&#34; Cole said. &#34;We need to keep sentiments aside and do the right thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The right thing?&#34; Jaris chuckled. &#34;And what might that be? Executing her?&#34; The mere mention of the word made me shiver.I didn&#39;t want to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For centuries, we have been guarded by laws and tradition, your Highness. If these didn&#39;t exist, our world would&#39;ve definitely been a mess. Siphons have always been executed to protect us. We will not stop now,&#34;another Executioner said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not asking you to stop,&#34; Jaris shrugged. &#34;I am just telling you you will not be touching her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A series of gasps and &#39;what&#39; rippled through the room.Cole&#39;s eyes darkened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you trying to say?&#34; His voice was colder too.&#34;With all due respect, your Highness, I hope you&#39;re not trying to imply that the life of your mate should be spared.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris said nothing, letting them all to see the answer in his eyes. It was enough to rile the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is simply not possible!&#34; Lucy&#39;s lookalike roared.&#34;She killed one of our own when, according to her,she didn&#39;t mean to. She is dangerous and cannot live amongst us. The law will not be broken for her sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; hand separated from mine. My heart quickened as he walked forward, taking composed, gradual steps. He kept his eyes on the Executioner that had just spoken, and though she didn&#39;t retreat as he got closer,her eyes did show a little bit of fear. It was impossible for anyone not to feel intimidated when Jaris was in this mood of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally stopped in front of her, foot to foot, his eyes piercing into hers. She suddenly appeared small before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And who are you to decide when the law will or will not be broken?&#34; He cocked his head to the side. &#34;If I will it, I can make you never to step foot in the Silver Citadel, ever again. That is how little your power is.The only time you do have power is when you wield your sword against who you consider enemy,and I am telling you, my mate is not one. You want my advice?&#34;He directed his gaze at the rest of them. &#34;Take your blood-hungry selves away from here and go find someone else to hunt. I do not care what you think,but if a single hair on Lyric&#39;s head goes missing...&#34; He tsked. &#34;You&#39;ll wish you never came after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked back to me, took my hand and exited the hall.</p>
