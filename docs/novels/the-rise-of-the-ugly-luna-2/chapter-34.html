                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chin hit the floor in utter surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off Jaris. What in the name of the moon?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not the reaction I&#39;d expected. I thought he&#39;d call me names and everything ugly. But he was taking this better than I expected!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Roderick&#39;s voice sounded bewildered and shaken. &#34;N...No. This is not the reason I came here.I came here to warn you about her. To tell you to kick her out!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you can have her?&#34; Jaris huffed. &#34;I&#39;m afraid it doesn&#39;t work that way with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick sprang to his feet, his gaze now contorted in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sorry too, but I have no intention of letting her go either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room turned ice cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened next was a blur-too fast for my mind to fully register. Jaris seized Roderick by the collar,and the first punch landed hard and sharp against his jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick struggled, but Jaris was already slamming him against the wall with brutal ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Good moon...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was strong-l had seen him in fights before. He could take down three men at once without breaking a sweat. But here? Against Jaris? He looked like a shadow against a towering oak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly dawned on me what they say about Jaris being the most powerful Alpha. I was having a first hand experience of it. &#34;Jaris!&#34; Luna Isolde rose to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris didn&#39;t stop. He delivered more blows and kicks to Roderick, then tossed him hard against a table. The table broke to the ground as he landed with a crash.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Somebody, stop him!&#34; The Luna barked at Kael and Nerion who were in the room. It was as if she was scared of interfering herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion, however, still didn&#39;t make an attempt to stop Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris reached for Roderick on the ground. His claws shot out, slashing across Roderick&#39;s chest. Blood bloomed through his shirt as he let out a low, guttural growl of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was bleeding from the lips by now. He managed to get himself from the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris, retrieving a napkin from the back of his pocket, calmly wiped his hands. &#34;You&#39;re going to the temple today,Roderick.Whether or not you like it.&#34; He turned to Kael and Nerion. &#34;Bring him to the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was utterly speechless as Kael and Nerion dragged Roderick to the car.Good moon! It looked like a movie!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone had told me that Jaris would do this for me, I never would&#39;ve believed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my legs to move, going after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was forced into the backseat of the car, sitting next to Jaris who was obviously determined to hold him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Lyric.&#34; Nerion urged, and I followed him into the second car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in shock the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the temple, met the Priestess, and I told her the reason we were there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was already healing from his wounds. But the one Jaris had inflicted with his claws was still very fresh and looked painful. It should be healing by now as well. Were Jaris&#39; claws poisonous? &#34;Lyric, we can talk about this,&#34; the asshole said while we waited for the woman to return with our jar. &#34;I know I messed up, but I only did this because I wanted you back. Please, forgive me and take me back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a puzzled look. What an irony. Roderick Fletcher, begging me to give him a second chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t reward him with even the sound of my voice. Instead, I glared really hard at him and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop talking.&#34; It was Jaris, cutting him off in that terrifying tone of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the woman returned with our jar. Boldly in it were our names.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered when Roderick and I had done this step in the temple. I&#39;d been so happy that I was with someone despite being ugly. I had no idea that I was walking into hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening the jar, the woman took out the ribbon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this? Have you two... sat and discussed this? You know, after it&#39;s broken, it can never be fixed.&#34; The woman asked with a dutiful concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was one rule in our world. Once the ribbon was broken, the separated mates could never get back together. It was final.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure,&#34; I said without reluctance. I hated Roderick with every fiber of my being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir?&#34; The woman looked at Roderick who remained silent. &#34;Your consent is very important in this, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. Please, don&#39;t tell me he&#39;d mess this up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris extended his clawsas he stepped in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l rip your heart out before you even blink. You have my word, Roderick. Do the right thing.&#34; Jaris was naturally intimidating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Roderick&#39;s jaw tighten. But I didn&#39;t think he had much of a choice. &#34;I consent.&#34; He uttered the words with raw hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,he could rot for all I care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, them.&#34; The woman handed us a pair of tiny scissors next. &#34;You&#39;re to cut it the same time when I give the signal.Are you ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes and recited a prayer, calling on the gods of the moon to witness our separation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now!&#34; She urged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick and I placed the scissors and cut. The two halves dropped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, I felt a heavy weight leave me. My head, my chest, my shoulders-everything about me felt lighter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was free!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re done here. Let&#39;s go.&#34; Jaris said and started for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you aware she doesn&#39;t have a wolf!?&#34; Roderick yelled, bringing all of us to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! The son of a bitch! How could he use this against me!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was tortured with the silver iron at a young age, it made my wolf dormant. Roderick knew this but chose to throw it in my face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, Jaris chuckled. &#34;I know.&#34; He continued toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll pay for this!&#34; Roderick growled. &#34;Mark my words, Jaris Dreadmoor. You&#39;ll pay for what you did today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jaris didn&#39;t pay him a backward glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so happy I wanted to laugh. Roderick and I were finally over!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled at the asshole. &#34;Goodbye, Roderick. I hope life treats you as badly you treated me.&#34; His stare was as a sharp as a knife. I turned away from him and left, catching up with Jaris outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re driving with me, Lyric,&#34; Jaris said without looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened the front door and entered. He was actually the one driving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slightly nervous, I joined him in the front seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion entered the second car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So...Jaris wanted me to drive alone with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth flooded my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But...how did he know my wolf was dormant? And how come he didn&#39;t care?</p>
