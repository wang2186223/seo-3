                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Work went smoothly for the rest of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening when I was done with my shift, I called Jace and he met me in the parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed something off the moment I settled in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been the whole day?&#34; | turned to Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh..just cruising around with some friends?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He focused on driving the car while | focused my eyes on his body. He looked like he had been very busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then I saw it. The mark on his neck. It was that of a lipstick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell have you been, Jace?!&#34; My voice was more alarmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? I just told you I was with some friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, but you didn&#39;t tell me they were females. What sort of game were you playing that she&#39;d leave her lips on your neck?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand quickly went to his neck, making it obvious he didn&#39;t even know it was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shit,&#34; he cursed as he reached for a napkin and wiped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t feel good about this. &#34;Jace, what were you doing with this lady?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing, Lyric. You have to believe me and stop.asking questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was nowhere close to satisfied, but I let it be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we got home, I checked on Xyla and Xylon. Xylon had gotten way better over the month. It was impressive. He&#39;d stopped having his crisis, and I was sure in no time, he&#39;d be completely fine. Hopefully,by the time I find my kids and I&#39;m ready to leave, he&#39;d be strong enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After spending a little time with them, I proceeded to my room to get ready for my dinner with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was applying my nude lipstick when his text came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I&#39;m outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Extra Note: could you make use of the red lipstick tonight?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled an amused look at his request. Why was he specific about it? Had he always loved it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled and eagerly wiped the nude lipstick off, replacing it with red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave myself one final look in the mirror. I was wearing a red sleeveless jumpsuit, black heels, black hair styled in a messy bun, and red lipstick. I didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me l looked stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way outside and found Jaris waiting outside the car, his arms crossed. His gaze dragged from my head to toe, lingering on my lips. And I didn&#39;t miss the amusement in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look gorgeous,&#34; he complimented, but I could tell he wanted to say more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You too, Mr.Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a small smile as he stepped aside and to my surprise, opened the driver&#39;s door for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; he tilted his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want me to drive?&#34; It was one of his most expensive cars. But that wasn&#39;t even the case. He&#39;d always been the one to drive whenever we were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is your treat. You&#39;re taking care of me from the start of the evening to the very end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled and finally stepped in. His ideas were crazy, but I loved them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterall, he&#39;s been giving me some sort of Princess treatment for the past few weeks. Maybe it was time l returned the favour. We drove out of Darkspire with him sitting in the passenger seat beside me. It was amusing how it didn&#39;t even feel weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove to one of the best diners in Darkspire. I&#39;d never been here before but did my research during the day and even booked a reservation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People couldn&#39;t stop staring as I walked in with their Alpha. Well, the rumours have always been that Jaris and I were existing in a loveless relationship. They probably never expected us to walk in here together some day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We placed our orders and had a good time over our meals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris asked me how my resumption was at TCH, and I told him it&#39;d been bearable. The other patients didn&#39;t know I&#39;d been behind what happened, so they didn&#39;t act weird around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked about so many other things, and I even had the courage to ask him about his plan for when he became the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I plan to unite the Packs. Right now, the whole hierarchy system has ruined us. Some Alphas feel superior to others, and while this is important, the hierarchy system makes the lower Alphas feel less significant and pressured to always do more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was stunned by his reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So...would you be dissolving the hierarchy system when you become King?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and drank from his glass of red wine.&#34;Can&#39;t say for now. But I&#39;ll definitely be making it less humiliating for the lower Alphas. Let&#39;s see how it goes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled, eager to see Jaris Dreadmoor becoming King. He&#39;d make the perfect king. And me, his grand Luna.Our contract might be expiring in nine months, but at least for that short period of time, I&#39;d be his Luna and grand Luna to every other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t one to be freaked by power display, but it&#39;d be nice ruling beside Jaris like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hope you enjoying the meal?&#34; | asked a while later. &#34;Sure am. You made the right choice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A minute later, I stood up. &#34;I think I need to use the restroom. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just suddenly became pressed without control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I used the restroom and as I washed my hands in the sink, thoughts of Jaris filled my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never felt this happy in a long time. Jaris and I being &#39;together this way, it was something I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;ve always wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh, if only the Executioners weren&#39;t looking for the old me, I&#39;d have gladly told him who I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was air-drying my hands when I heard footsteps behind me. Figuring it would be a female coming to use the restroom, I didn&#39;t bother for a look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I heard them stop behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart went from pumping to frosty in a heartbeat. Chills traveled all the way from my head to my spine and down to my toes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were wide as I dragged them to the mirror ahead of me. Behind me was the monster. The very onel spent weeks trying to get over. The very one I&#39;d been praying to the Moon goddess never to let me see again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden was rigt behind me, and there was no stopping the scream that escaped my lips.</p>
