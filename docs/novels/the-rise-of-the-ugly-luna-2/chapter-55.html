                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feel free to tell me about it. Everything, Jaris,&#34; Nivia said,her voice alone sounding soothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few days ago, if someone had told me I&#39;d be seeking out Nivia for help, I&#39;d have punched them in the nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a popular psychological doctor.People came to her when they were passing through things they could not understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being over sixty years old, Nivia was very experienced and well respected in our world. People say she had answers to every psychological problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood facing the window, my hand in my trouser pocket as I told her my problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For more than fifteenyears, I have not been able to cum.&#34; Except that one time, five years ago. But l didn&#39;t mention that. &#34;I am hardly even aroused or interested in a woman. But a week ago, I saw someone naked. And that very night, I came to the image of it.&#34;I shook my head. &#34;I have not been able to get it off my mind. Worse, I keep cumming to that very image.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did not have any fear of sharing this with Nivia. She was well known for keeping things confidential. What was said in her room remains in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we talking about a man or a woman?&#34; She asked from where she was seated behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; I saw her bob through the reflection in the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Alpha; how exactly do you feel when you see this woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her question took me by surprise. I realized that I had never actually thought of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; I shrugged. &#34;She&#39;s beautiful. A lot of men are attracted to her. And...each time I see her with them, it gets on my nerves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you like her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t,&#34; | snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She betrayed me. I couldn&#39;t care for someone like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nivia gave me a long stare. I caught her staring through the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did she do to upset you, Alpha?&#34; She wore a small smile. &#34;It is obvious you are trying to deny your feelings because she hurt you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to her, letting her see the seriousness in my eyes as I said my next words. &#34;I feel nothing for that woman. Honestly,all I want is to get rid of that image because I hate that they have such an effect on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sighed as she looked down at her book where she scribbled something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, there is only one explanation for this. If this woman has this hold over you, it&#39;s only because she&#39;s your fated mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My countenance dropped. The words hit me, making me silent for a moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is not possible. I already have a fated mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Greta. That was my mate&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d already met eight years ago. But unfortunately,she went missing. Or maybe, ran away. She was terrified when she learned we were mates. She had always been afraid of I and my family. Although,mother had been doing all she could to find her so she could take her rightful place as my Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t possible to have two fated mates. I thought they said Nivia was the best?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Only a fated mate can do something like this, Alpha,&#34;she insisted. &#34;Your wolf likes her. It welcomes her.That can only happen when it&#39;s your fated mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never should&#39;ve come to Nivia, because all she did was make things more complicated for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not possible to have two fated mates.&#34; I grabbed my jacket from the arm of the chair I&#39;d been sitting on.&#34;I&#39;m afraid you were not helpful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I reached Darkspire, I started packing up my bags. The plan was to leave at midnight when no one would see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I already agreed to meet up at the outskirts of Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated that I was doing this. Hated that I was leaving everything behind. But Jace was right. It wasn&#39;t safe anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was nearly done with my bags when a hurried knock came on my door. I startled before going to get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It turned out to be one of the kids&#39; nanny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. Their mother isn&#39;t around and-and I don&#39;t know who else to call. It&#39;s Xylon,&#34; she stuttered, her forehead damp with sweat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was in my throat as I ran to the kids&#39; room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the floor was Xylon, shaking profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please,no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was having another crisis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this one seemed worse. He had blood running through his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla was beside him, weeping profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to stay calm as I knelt beside him and told the nannies what to gather for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the nannies hurried to get them, I lifted Xylon&#39;s head onto my legs and rubbed circles on his back and chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine. You&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, Xylon was completely fine.Although, he was very weak and had his head on my legs.I managed to convince him to eat something. So,the nannies had gone to get them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; he muttered weakly, stupefying me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? &#34;For what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bothering you.&#34; He was struggling to keep his eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears pooled in my eyes as I looked at his pitiful face.I sniffled and forced a chuckle. &#34;Don&#39;t be silly, Xylon.There&#39;s nothing to be sorry for. It is my duty,remember?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes didn&#39;t open. I quickly checked his pulse and was relieved he was just sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;He&#39;s fine. There&#39;s nothing to worry about,&#39; I told myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear dropped to my cheek. And another,until I was completely sobbing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I couldn&#39;t leave him. Not when he was like this.Not when he was suffering this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care about my safety anymore. I was ready to stay back and help him, even if it meant losing my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed longer with the kids and only left when they were both sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired as I walked back to my room. I&#39;d have to call Jace and tell him about the change of plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused when I got to my room and found the door open. Someone had been here. Or was still here. I went in, and to my surprise, it wwas Jaris. He was there in the center of the room, leaning against the dresser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was relieved that it was just him and not some unwanted intruder. But my relief was short -lived when I noticed the anger in his eyes. And worse of it all, I knew the reason he was that way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before him were my bags, all packed and lined up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knows I was trying to leave.</p>
