                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the bed was a young boy, just about the girl&#39;s age,shaking profusely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t shivering kind of shake. He looked like someone who was in hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forehead was beaded with sweat, and his tiny hands were fisted around the sheets. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d seen a little child in so much pain before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My goodness, what is wrong with him?&#34; | asked,alarmed, as I ran to meet him in the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were tightly shut, small grunts of pain escaping his throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It happens to him often but it&#39;s getting worse by the day. I don&#39;t know where mummy went, and daddy&#39;s busy. I can&#39;t go to him.&#34; Touching the boy&#39;s forehead, it was as hot as burning coal, I almost hissed. For the love of Selene,he was in a terrible state! A child like him didn&#39;t deserve to go through this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should be finding a way to get him to his parents to take him to a doctor, but I think I might know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to the little girl to ask her something,only to discover she was crying. A part of my heart fractured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, honey, he&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll make him fine,&#34;|said, hoping that would assure her. &#34;I just need your help gathering some things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her help, I was able to get a bowl of warm water from the bathroom andsome napkins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat on the bed, lifted the boy&#39;s head onto my legs and gently massaged his forehead with one of the napkins which l&#39;d dipped into the bowl. I repeated the process for a while, the whole time, praying to the protectors of the moon to help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I finished with the napkin, he was a bit calmer. I moved to massage the back of his head, a spot in particular. This should do the final trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few minutes, the boy had stopped shaking and looked like he was in a simple nap. Being calmer,I was able to see how handsome he looked. His hair looked so lustrous and perfect that for a moment,was tempted to tousle it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He looks fine,&#34; the little girl said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xyla,&#34; she blushed, amusing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s a pretty name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More to my amusement, her cheeks became increasingly rosy. She was such a cute little girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do your parents go to work? Is that why they aren&#39;t here?&#34; | was curious to know why the boy was alone when he was clearly sick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy goes to work sometimes, but daddy&#39;s here. My father is the Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was like a canon blast rang out in my skull. My fingers which were still massaging the boy&#39;s head instantly froze, my pulse quickening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the girl, wide-eyed. &#34;Y-Your father is Alpha Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded, wearing a smile like she was proud of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My world came crumbling down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, this was not possible. Jaris had kids!? And possibly a lover?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was not supposed to be a problem, but these kids looked like five-year-olds the exact time he had slept with me, right before he abandoned me in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, he already had a family when he met me at the bar? What did that say about him? He was a cheat?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, aunty?&#34; The little girl asked,snapping me back to reality. Staring at her now made me a little emotional. Of course, there had never been any hope for Jaris and me. He already had a beautiful family to start with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, sweetheart.&#34; I managed a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but wonder who their mother was. She must have been prettier than I was five years ago.How could Jaris have left her for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t have had an issue with him abandoning me in the morning if he hadn&#39;t given me hope that night.He had called me beautiful and even asked for an extra day. But in the end, he was just like the others.This whole thing had been a mistake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door suddenly opened, happening just in time to stop my stupid tears from spilling. A young woman,who looked about my age, entered, wearing a long pretty dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She froze at the door, her face contorting in a frown as she looked at me like I was a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; Her voice when she spoke was smooth, hinting at a woman wvho had been privileged in life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little boy was still asleep on my legs. I was afraid to wake him up with any slight movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. I&#39;m Lyric,&#34; I said with a small smile. Who was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give a hoot about your name, lady. What the hell are you doing in here? And why are you holding my son?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It crashed over me like an unexpected wave, leaving me reeling for some seconds.Oh,wow...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was Jaris&#39; lover. Of course, he must love her to have kids with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As gently as possible, I lifted the little boy&#39;s head onto a pillow and stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I have to call the guards on you?&#34; The lady asked, her tone not friendly one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before | could respond, Xyla did. &#34;I called her mummy. Xylon was having one of his crises and needed help. I was on my way to get help when l found her in the passage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady huffed. &#34;So, you invite strangers into your room? Where did you learn that, Xyla?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something about the way the lady communicated with the kid that made me uncomfortable. Even the little girl slightly recoiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze sharp, she turned back to me. &#34;I think you&#39;re grown enough to know better than to listen to what kids say. It was wrong of you have follow a little girl in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay... But I had to save a suffering child. Wasn&#39;t that worth it?&#34; What was her problem? I thought she&#39;d be appreciative or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes. &#34;It&#39;s not like you can do anything for him. I have been the one taking care of Xylon since his crisis began. Nobody has been able to help him other than me.&#34; &#34;But the aunty was able to help him, mummy,&#34; the little girl said. &#34;And Xylon got better immnediately.I&#39;d never seen him recover so quickly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched surprise flicker through the lady&#39;s eyes.She looked at the boy on the bed again, and this time, there was a certain recognition in her eyes, like she was just noticing he was indeed better.</p>
