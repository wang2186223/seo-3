                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited outside Luna Isolde&#39;s room, waiting for Maddy to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hear their conversation, and it had taken all of my willpower not to barge in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy finally showed up, looking angrier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&#34; I followed her as she walked past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Maddy. Don&#39;t do this to me. I&#39;ve been worried sick. What&#39;s going with Jaris? You know something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ignored me and just maintained a straight face,looking ahead as she walked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy!&#34; I grabbed her hand. &#34;Can you say something?We&#39;re not strangers!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pulled her hand free and brushed her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s dangerous, Lyric. Trust me, it&#39;d be best if you don&#39;t know.&#34; She continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you talking about? I don&#39;t care how dangerous it is. Just fucking tell me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish I can!&#34; She yelled, standing in front of her door.&#34;My brothers and l-we&#39;ve always had this pact where we never reveal our secrets to outsiders. No matter what, we don&#39;t tell them what we are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words were unsettling. What were they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She opened her door, and I followed her into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy, please. I&#39;m losing my mind here. If you don&#39;t help me, there&#39;s no telling what I&#39;d do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me about half an hour to finally get her to open up. She didn&#39;t know how grateful I was for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris is at a point where he can&#39;t control himself. He&#39;s...battling some mental problems and has probably gone away to isolate himself. That was what he always did back then when it was too much for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression clenched in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t think he&#39;s mentally ill. I meant,he was with me yesterday and-&#34; I paused when I remembered what happened in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He did act strange last night,&#34; I mumbled, more to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly,the pieces started to come together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden making mention of his &#39;gift&#39; to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris bleeding in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two bodies with the claw marks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; I quickly turned to Maddy. &#34;Jaris didn&#39;t kill those people,did he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy&#39;s eyes dropped to the floor. It dawned on me that it was the secret she&#39;d been trying to protect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was just like Caden.He was a Hexed wolf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gods,&#34; I muttered, shaking my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t tell you anything.&#34; Maddy turned away,brushing her fingers into her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t need to say anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This whole time, everyone thought Caden was the only Hexed wolf. Jaris was just like him. Only difference was, he had been pretty good at controlling himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did Caden somehow get to trigger his urges? How could he do such a thing at a time like this when the final trial was close? &#34;Where is he?&#34; I asked after a while. The news was still too heavy to stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy looked at me like I&#39;d asked for the impossible.&#34;I&#39;m not telling you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she did know where he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy,come on. I just need to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, rest it out. Trust me, you don&#39;t want to be anywhere near him. He&#39;s beyond dangerous right now.He might&#39;ve gotten to the stage where he doesn&#39;t even recognize friend and foe. Everyone is just foe to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed silent for a minute, thinking her words were true. Then, I decided I didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just want to see him. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t make sense of this overwhelming longing to be near him. I just felt he was lonely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, stop it. You&#39;re a mere wolf and might end up dead. Trust me, there&#39;s a reason Jaris isolated himself.He&#39;s become a danger to everyone around him. For now, he needs to be left alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For how long!&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t know! Until he learns to control his urges again.It took him a year the last time, though. But he&#39;s done it before. I&#39;m sure he can do it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? My mouth dropped open. A whole year? A lot of things would&#39;ve gone wrong in a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha King Throne would have been handed over to someone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our contract would&#39;ve expired by then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have found my kids and be long gone from here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And what would Darkspire do without their Alpha for a whole year?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T-That&#39;s unacceptable,&#34; I shook my head in disapproval. &#34;Please, Maddy. Do this for me. I promise,I&#39;ll return the favour someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still adamant and it had to take me more convincing to get her her on my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll give you the address, but I&#39;ll not be going with you. And I&#39;m serious. I&#39;m not risking my life on this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded eagerly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of involving Kael and Nerion; but if he was as dangerous as Maddy said, I wouldn&#39;t want to involve anyone in this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scribbled the address on a piece of paper and handed it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This was the cabin he used the last time. Hopefully,it&#39;s the same one he&#39;s using this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took note of the place. It was quite far from Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Maddy. I won&#39;t forget this.&#34; I hugged her before running out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me four hours to get to the location. I was alarmed at how isolated the place was the more I kept going closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove past so many trees and bushes for almost an hour and didn&#39;t see any buildings in sight. The very few ones I saw looked abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a split second, I considered heeding Maddy&#39;s advice and just leaving it alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the thought of all the things that could go wrong kept me from doing that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally reached the cabin and spent time in the car,trying to picture what I&#39;d find in there.Would Jaris really have no control of himself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was alone and troubled. It was awful for someone to be alone in this condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter what I&#39;d see. I was sure I&#39;d be able to protect myself if need be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the car and went toward the cabin. I tried peeking through the window but couldn&#39;t see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he actually wasn&#39;t here? That would be messy because we&#39;d have to think of somewhere else he could actually be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about moving from the window to the door when I heard a faint voice from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, please. You have to take this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. It was a female&#39;s voice, and it wasn&#39;t even Marta&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Baby, please. Just open your lips for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes expanded in disbelief as an unfathomable shock penetrated deep into my soul</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris wasn&#39;t alone! Who the hell was that?!</p>
