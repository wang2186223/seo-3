                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned to the Capital City and saw the loads of damage that&#39;s been done while I was being held captive by Caden, my hatred for him only multiplied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot of my people were dead. Properties destroyed, relationships broken. Everything was a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although my men informed me that for the past three days, there had been no more fights as the lower Alphas seemed to have backed down. But they have been very unresponsive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a gut feeling that more was coming. And this would be something I wouldn&#39;t like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s enough,&#34; I told the makeup artist, bringing her to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But this isn&#39;t what the boss asked me to do on your face,&#34; the woman tried to object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you said, &#39;my face&#39;. Npw, I just told you it&#39;s enough. So,leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bowing her head, she gathered her things and left with her assistants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat with a steady frown on my face as I stared at my reflection in the mirror. I hated what I looked like. I was beautiful-yes. But I hated that I looked this way for him. And today, for the first time, he was going to introduce me to everyone-including Jaris&#39; people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been three weeks since Caden forced me to stay with him. I&#39;d been doing everything he wanted-torturing people, getting answers out of some, and doing other despicable things to them for his satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Word was out that Caden had a strong Siphon on his side. As a result, people had become very scared of him. He&#39;s used me as his ladder to power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Aside that, he&#39;s managed to get control over the lower Alphas. The lower Alphas were in alliance with him and even considered him their King, and today, they were all about to hold a meeting to finalize their separation from the higher Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The werewolf world was going to be split today. Territories and families would split from people they had once dined with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head in disbelief at the new reality. Caden was, no doubt, a scheming bastard. He&#39;d carefully planned everything from the beginning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other day, I confronted him about it,and since he was already winning and had nothing to hide, he opened up about it. He told me he was the one who triggered the late Alpha Miguel to try to take the company from Jaxen, using his high-ranking authorities. He did this, knowing very well that it&#39;d lead to a clash between the Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he killed Miguel and made it seem like Jaxen did, making Jaris to hold a grudge against the lower Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From there, he orchestrated little fights between the two ranks, sparked reactions and waited for the whole thing to bloom into chaos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he stepped in like a savior to the lower Alphas, offering to help them when, in fact, this was all his doing.The guy was a monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose to my feet,sought for my jewelries and was slowly putting them on when the door opened behind me.Our eyes connected through the mirror where he leaned on the doorframe, his hands resting in his pant pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a noble appearance dressed in a suit. I wanted to laugh at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look lovely. The dress, I mean.&#34; He pushed off the doorway, coming toward me in relaxed steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My belly grew tight, my muscles tensing. Done with the first ear, I reached for the second earring, keeping my eyes on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came to a stop behind me, so close he was touching my chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the makeup...&#34; he tsked. &#34;Doesn&#39;t look like what I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand dropped from my ear, the earring still in it. &#34;This is okay. I didn&#39;t want something too heavy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; He rolled his thumb against his lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking around the chair, he held my shoulders and slowly, turned me around to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes scrutinized mny face from side to side before he gave a shake of his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Might be okay for you, but it&#39;s still not what I wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist worked next, connecting with my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen it coming. But what could I have possibly done when I knew there was no way to escape it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned as I bent in haIf, my hand flying to my midriff with the earring dropping to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand came to the back of my neck where he held me roughly. I was sure he was avoiding my hair and face because he didn&#39;t want to mess it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You do things my way, Lyric. Not yours. I thought you should be used to this already?&#34; He spoke with lethal calmness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my trembling lip as I fought to hold back my tears. I couldn&#39;t shed them on my makeup. It was only going to get him more upset.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, what do you say when you&#39;re wrong?&#34; His voice reduced to a slow whisper, his hand now caressing the back of my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated the idea of giving him what he wanted, so I tried to hold off as much as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me hurt you more than I already have, Lyric. What do you say?&#34; His voice got a little rough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled,deciding I was tired and wanted this night to end already. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smug smile crept into his evil face. His hand finally letgo off my neck as he took a step back, tucking both his hands into his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finish up and come out. We&#39;re almost late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared hatefully at him as he walked out the door. There were so many things I wished I could do to him.Unfortunately, I was trapped in this hell wvith Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*********+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of the window in my room, lost in the vast space I stared out in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was completely ready for the meeting, but that wasn&#39;t what bothered me. Just like it&#39;s been for the past three weeks, I&#39;ve had this strange anger in me. Like there was something important I needed to do that was l was yet to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had the crazy urge to get mad and hurt someone, only I didn&#39;t know who.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Small knocks reached the door before my kids opened up and stepped in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going out, daddy?&#34; Xyla asked, her voice lacking excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. But daddy will be home shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going with mummy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Mummy has her own place to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta had been doing all she could to accompany me to events for the past three weeks, but I wasn&#39;t interested in having any lady beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the problem?&#34; I asked when I noticed the kids looking sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>it&#39;s been hell around here for the past few weeks. My kids were no longer happy. Their eyes were mostly looking lifeless, their smiles hard to find. I didn&#39;t know what was wrong with them, but I sure hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crouched in front of them, running a hand through Xylon&#39;shair. &#34;Talk to me, sweetheart. Is there something you need?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared into my eyes with her puppy-like kind of eyes. &#34;Have you heard from aunty Lyric?&#34;</p>
