                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up some hours later in a clinic. The pain had subsided and made me realize the full impact of my situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, I didn&#39;t think about the Luna or the people blaming me. My mind was too carried away by the blood I&#39;d seen between my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I heard Jace&#39;s familiar voice, followed by the feel of his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when I realized he was sitting next to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no light in his eyes. Just plain sorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My baby,&#34; I quickly tried to touch my tummy, only to realize I couldn&#39;t move my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced down and to my horror, my hands were cuffed on both sides of the bed. No. There&#39;s no need for this. They couldn&#39;t do this to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to calm down, Lyric,&#34; Jace said as l struggled with the cuffs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s the doctor?&#34; I was panting heavily.&#34;My baby. Is it okay? I need to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to rest for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk to me, Jace! There was so much blood. My baby-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You lost the baby.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strong painful one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what I felt deep in my head as his words settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost the baby. Which baby?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What baby? What&#39;re you talking about?&#34; He lowered his head, trying to hide the pain I just caught a glimpse of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, you need to talk to me. What baby?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still wouldn&#39;t look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly became difficult to breathe. Before I knew it, I was panting heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head dropped back on the pillow as I closed my eyes and tried to calm myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;s talking about another baby, Lyric. Not yours.It couldn&#39;t have been yours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard someone calling my name, followed by my shoulders being shook. But I couldn&#39;t tell who it was as I focused more on calming myself, the voices sounding muffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. I can&#39;t breathe. I can&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34; The voice was louder now, followed by a hard slap on my arm. It was Jace. Was I having a panic attack? &#34;Stay with me. Open your eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did. But his face was soon blurred by the tears that came flooding down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s mine,&#34; I sobbed. &#34;Tell me my baby&#39;s okay. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to hold my belly but couldn&#39;t as my hands were cuffed. I couldn&#39;t do anything!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst out screaming and crying. Jace stood up and held me, but there was only little his touch could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost my child. Again. Why was this always happening to me? How can one person be so unlucky?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t I strong enough to defend myself and my child? Why did I always attract enemies to myself?Why always me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head ached from how much l&#39;d cried. Yet, I couldn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt like the world was ending, and honestly,I wish l could die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to talk about your life, Lyric,&#34; Jace said with a gloomy reflection. &#34;The news of what you did has gone viral. Some people are mad at you for killing the Luna. Although, some seem to understand that you did it because she attacked you. But you know...they&#39;ve always been scared of you using your Siphon powers against people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the reason my baby&#39;s dead,&#34; I said through gritted teeth. Right now, I couldn&#39;t care less that she was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. If it were anyone else, I&#39;m sure the people wouldn&#39;t have minded. But she&#39;s Jaris&#39; mother. Plus they think she didn&#39;t deserve to die when she wasn&#39;t trying to kill you. They didn&#39;t even know for sure if she was the one who attacked first or you did and she only defended.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him in disbelief, my mouth parting.&#34;Y-You know me, Jace. I&#39;d have never-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I know you. It&#39;s just the people having different opinions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t even kill her!&#34; I glanced up at the ceiling.&#34;Why does everyone think I did? I passed out after she hit me repeatedly and woke up to see she was dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...she was killed by a Siphon, and you&#39;re the only Siphon we have around, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m telling you, I didn&#39;t kill her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Do you think someone used your fingers when you were unconscious to do it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;No. You can&#39;t use your wolf powers if you&#39;re unconscious, can you? It goes both ways. My powers are inactive when I&#39;m unconscious.I didn&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s face fell as his brows furrowed in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If a Siphon really killed the Luna, then I&#39;m telling you, it wasn&#39;t me. We have another Siphon in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled on my cuffs again. &#34;I need to get out of here. Please. I need to speak with Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the look I&#39;d seen in his eyes was pure torture. He&#39;d been so hurt. He may not have had the best relationship with his mother, but I was sure she meant something to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lyric, but I&#39;m not sure you can see Jaris.No one has been able to see him since he went to his room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s hurt,&#34; I whimpered. &#34;He thinks I killed his mother. I didn&#39;t. I&#39;d never do that to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to get out of here, Jace.My baby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But there was nothing Jace could do as he told me there were guards stationed just outside my door to make sure I didn&#39;t try to escape. I was doomed either way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did everything turn so bad? The more the clock ticked, the more I lost the will to fight. What was there to fight for, anyway when I was always a loser?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even when four guards came over and took me away from the room, I couldn&#39;t fight them. I didn&#39;t do anything as they led me to a cell and locked me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my hands no longer chained, I clutched my belly, mourning my loss. Why did I always have to be so unlucky with kids?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full day, I was alone in the cell with Jace the only visitor I had. We couldn&#39;t touch each other as the bars separated us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has anyone been able to reach Jaris? Can you tell him I want to see him?&#34;|asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he told me Jaris has still refused to see anyone since the incident. It killed me to know he was hurting and didn&#39;t have anyone with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you need to worry more about yourself,Lyric,&#34; Jace said. &#34;According to the law, you&#39;ll have to be punished with the death penalty for what you did.This is killing the people&#39;s trust in Siphons. Honestly,I wish this didn&#39;t happen because it&#39;s ruining a lot of things we were happy had been built.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I didn&#39;t do it, Jace!&#34; I snapped. &#34;I&#39;m the victim here! The Luna attacked me and made me lose my child. I don&#39;t understand how she&#39;s dead, but I didn&#39;t kill her! Do you understand me? I didn&#39;t!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired of hearing the subtle blame in his words.When would they understand that I was the victim in all of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, someone else came visiting. But knew it couldn&#39;t be good since it was Maddy.</p>
