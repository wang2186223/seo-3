                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the hallway leading to the rooms. If I could reach it, maybe I&#39;d find a room to hide in. But l knew that wouldn&#39;t be possible. He was too close to me and would definitely catch me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I squealed as he came toward me. &#34;I-I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist connected with my face immediately, making me see stars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first covered with his blood, which meant my makeup was ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed a handful of hair and pulled so hard I cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That was very foolish, Lyric.&#34; He growled in my face.&#34;You know, all I wanted to do was talk. But looks like you want us to busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just let me go!&#34; I cried out. &#34;I don&#39;t want to be here!&#34; &#34;Why?&#34; He smirked-that devilish smirk of his. &#34;You&#39;d rather be with my brother? Are you so eager to watch him fail?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he mean by that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t think I&#39;d lethim win the trial so easily, did you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,he wouldn&#39;t dare!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustrated, I did what I knew best. I gripped his hand and attempted siphoning. But confusion set in when l realized it wasn&#39;t working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? What was wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even seem to know what I was doing as he dragged me by the hair to the couch, making me land roughly on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand protectively flew to my belly. I didn&#39;t even know why I was holding it. I was just scared of him hitting me there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to sit here, Lyric, and hear what I have to say,&#34; he growled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS After reading the Silver Citadel, I met with the Elders and Zarek where we had a long discussion concerning the rules of the final trial. It was meant to be bloody,and they wanted us to understand that we were not supposed to kill each other. But of course, if the situation did arise and one of us ended up dead, the other person would not be blamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They also asked if any of us wanted to drop out of it,but neither of us was ready to do that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking out of the meeting room, I dialed Lyric and was concerned when she didn&#39;t answer her phone. For the love of everything good, I did hope she was here already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to the stage, I scanned my eyes around but there was no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Lyric here?&#34; I asked Kael who had come to meet me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. Jace just arrived, and he said he hadn&#39;t seen her at the Pack House before leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was strange. Did she go to see a doctor or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about my mother and Maddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re here already.&#34; &#34;And Lyric didn&#39;t come with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call home. Have someone look for her. I need feedback on this as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Caden didn&#39;t hit me again but went ahead to tell me stories from when he and Jaris were younger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guy was really sick in the head. I couldn&#39;t believe he was comfortably telling me stories when he was holding me captive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had stopped bleeding, but my cheek still hurt from where he hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole time while he spoke endlessly, I kept thinking of ways I could escape this place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was probably built in a way that it was automatically locked when she shot, and Caden must be with the key. As scary as it was, there was no way l was getting out of here without his approval. I got worried thinking about Jaris. What if he was looking for me already? Would he get distracted? By the hunts, I hoped he wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me, Lyric? What do I have to do to get you on my side?&#34; Caden asked a while later, his arms crossed from where he sat on the couch. &#34;I know you helped Jaris with his urges. How did you even do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared up at him. &#34;I didn&#39;t do anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed. &#34;Okay. Answver my question. How do I get you on my side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even understand what he meant. I was just too focused thinking of a way to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when he stood up and started toward me, I also sprang to my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile held a challenge as he kept coming toward me while I retreated. The next thing happened too fast. He moved at me at the speed of lightning,grabbed me by the waist and throat and slammed me against the wall. I gasped loudly, My mind swirled with dazzling spots for a fleeting second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain shot through my lower abdomen, making me whimper. But the asshole didn&#39;t even seem to notice. &#34;Do you remember the things I said at the diner?&#34; He loosened his hand around my throat, allowing me the space to breathe. &#34;About you being in my head a little too much? Well, guess what? It&#39;s gotten worse, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed from his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These days, I find it harder to not think about you You&#39;re imbued in my memory; in everything I do. I had to abduct the kids to fucking get you here.&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Releasing my throat, he ran his hand to my hair,caressing the edges. &#34;Maybe it has to do with the fact that you&#39;re very pretty. I mean, a girl with your face could make a man do anything she wants. Is that the reason I am so obsessed with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh in his face. Caden was obsessed with me? And he was telling me this right after he hit me in the face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get over it,&#34; I told him truthfully. &#34;I&#39;d rather die than fall into the arms of someone like you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked his head to the side, his disappointment evident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we get serious? Name your price. What do I have to do to get you from my brother?&#34; &#34;Is that what you see me as? A price?&#34; | huffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just answer my damn question!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There is no price!&#34; I yelled in his face. &#34;I love your brother. And what we share...it goes beyond what people likeyou can see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never thought I&#39;d be saying these words about Jaris before now, but it suddenly felt liberating. So natural.So true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your brother is the only man I&#39;ve ever loved. And you thinking you could have a place in this heart of mine is -&#34; I laughed.&#34;Laughable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can beat me all you want,Caden. Ruin my body and leave me bruised for weeks. But that is as far as it&#39;ll ever go. You&#39;ll never be able to penetrate my skin.My heart?&#34; I tsked. &#34;It&#39;s only going to be a fantasy for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened to the point that should get me shaking. Yet, all I felt was utmost satisfaction.He could kill me now and I&#39;d be glad he got to hear this piece of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His nostrils flared just before he stepped back and slapped me in the face. It was so hard it brought me to my knees. When the initial pain subsided, I looked him in the face and laughed. That infuriated him the more because he kicked me in the chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,damn it. That one hurt.</p>
