                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; My voice shook as I called his name, my hands tenderly holding his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where did this... where did this come from?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion wrapped itself around me. Jaris was losing consciousness, his neck going limp in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I heard someone clapping. My heart ached terribly as I glanced and found Caden coming, his men behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away immediately, focusing my attention on Jaris who had passed out in my ams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.What was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand shook as I pulled out the arrow. Blood sprouted from the neck, staining my shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;J-Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Jaris had survived way more than this. A mere arrow shouldn&#39;t be enough to put him ouut like this.I was yet to see anything that was enough to put him out this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sincerely, Lyric, I&#39;m sorry I had to interrupt that. I was genuinely interested and entertained,&#34; Caden said with a snicker. &#34;But you know, time is of the essence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes remained locked on Jaris. I was trying to Siphon him, but nothing seemed to be working.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at Caden, my eyes filled with tears. &#34;What have you done to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Me? Nothing much. Simply put him to sleep like he did me all those years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different kind of rage burnt through my chest. I wanted to hurt the bastard. But for some reason, I couldn&#39;t leave Jaris. I wanted to keep holding onto him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You played right into my trap, Lyric,&#34; he tsked. &#34;You really thought it&#39;d be that easy to escape my mansion if I didn&#39;t want you to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted to my phone on the floor. Did he track it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. I had to track it,&#34; he confirmed my fear. &#34;Otherwise, why would I care so much and handit to you when you were meant to be my prisoner? To be honest, I thought you&#39;d call him sooner. Surprised it took you this long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears dropped from the tip of my nose to Jaris&#39; face. He still didn&#39;t move an inch. And why the hell were my powers not working on him!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t work, darling. Not when the poison was made with your blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at hi with a confused face.&#34;My blood?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;Was pretty easy to get when you were unconscious.&#34; His lips stretched in a grin smile. &#34;You have no idea how powerful you are, Lyric. You know that, right? I told you,we could rule the world together.The witch that helped Jaris put me asleep years ago is dead. This is why he couldn&#39;t put me to sleep again because there was no one to help him. What he didn&#39;t know however, is the fact that you are a weapon that is far more powerful than that very witch. He wasn&#39;t interested in utilizing you; so he didn&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head ached from the onslaught of information. I suddenly felt used. Deceived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you?&#34; My tone came out whispered and shaky. &#34;You used me to hurt Jaris? Why? How?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got harder to hold him to mysel. It was my fault this happened. Once again, I&#39;d brought nothing but trouble to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tears welled up as I thought of the blissful moment we&#39;d been having just a while ago.We were having our future planned out with Jaris ready to leave everything for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You took that away from me,&#34; I whimpered, my nose buried in Jaris&#39; hair. &#34;You took it from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i finally let him go, rose to my feet and struck Caden hard in the face. He didn&#39;t see it coming. He didn&#39;t stumble, but his hand went up to the side of his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struck him again, this time on his nose. When I tried to take the third hit, he held my fist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;ve had enough, Lyric.&#34; His voice was as dangerous as his eyes looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was far from done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With my free hand, I got hold of his wrist and for the second time, tried to Siphon him. But just like the first time,nothing worked.I could never understand why my powers were not working on him anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to notice this time and seemed surprised himself. He glanced down at the place where our hands were joined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t Siphon me. Why&#39;s that?&#34; He asked thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, obviously this wasn&#39;t his doing.Why the hell could I not Siphon him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still enraged, I tried to kick him in the groin. But he was faster and stopped mne before I could. His hand came to my hair, yanking painfully until I grunted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better calm down before I hurt you bad,&#34; he gritted in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You pathetic son of a bitch!&#34; I managed to slap him in the chest. &#34;You better kill me now. Kill me before l find a way to. Because I swear to the Moon, I&#39;ll kill you, Caden. I&#39;ll kill you myself and feed your body to the vultures!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed like a maniac before shoving me roughly to the ground. I hurt my ankle in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, Lyric, I&#39;d save the drama and listen to what I have to say. Because Jaris&#39; life is completely dependent on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding out his hand, one of his men placed a scroll in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now, I&#39;m the only one who can help Jaris. If you want him to survive, you&#39;ll sign this agreement with your blood. I&#39;m sure you know what it&#39;s called.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced from both fear and rage. An agreement with my blood? That would tie my life to it, making me unable to ever break or betray it. Wolves hardly ever sign that agreement because it never ends well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I want is for you to agree to be mine. You&#39;ll work for me, do my bidding and of course,stay away from Jaris. If you sign this, I&#39;ll give him the antidote to awaken him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think I&#39;d do that? Go to hell, Caden! No matter what you do, I&#39;ll never work with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your choice,&#34; he shrugged, rolling the scroll back up. &#34;I guess I&#39;ll just let Jaris sleep long enough until |completely conquer the world. By the time he&#39;s awake, everything he&#39;s ever owned will be mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got back on my feet. &#34;I won&#39;t let you do this to him. Give him the antidote, Caden. Stop this madness!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the scroll against his palm. &#34;It&#39;s quite simple if you want thàt to happen. I&#39;m sure you know how to find me when you&#39;ve had a change of heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked his head behind him. &#34;Take him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in panic. No...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four men approached Jaris&#39; body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t take him. I won&#39;t let you take him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;s the one with Jaris&#39; body, then I won&#39;t even have the chance to revive him if I find a way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to reach for the men&#39;s hands, but Caden pulled me back by the hair. His grip was so strong I couldn&#39;t fight him off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how I thrashed and begged him, he didn&#39;t listen to me and let the men take Jaris into their car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a monster. You&#39;ll pay for this, Caden. You&#39;ll fucking pay,&#34;I whimpered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sniggered in my face. &#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;Il pay if you get to work for me.&#34;</p>
