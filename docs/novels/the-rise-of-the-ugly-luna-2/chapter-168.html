                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nightfall came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until my stomach started growling that I realized I hadn&#39;t eaten since morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into the kitchen and the only readily edible thing I could find was bread. There was a lot of food stuff, but no cooked or stored meals. It made me wonder if Jaris had had anything to eat since he came here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ate some bread and jam and was clearing the kitchen table when Ericka walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her glare on me as she walked to the fridge where she took out a bottle of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apart from being his healer, did you and Jaris have any other history?&#34; | turned to her as I asked, leaning against the island.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand. Why are you asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because I overheard you call him &#39;baby&#39; earlier today I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a nickname friends of the opposite gender conveniently call each other.&#34; She huffed as she looked away from me,drinking from her bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t you going to answer my question?&#34; | asked when she was done drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris and I shared something in the past.&#34; She rolled her eyes as she looked at me. &#34;Yes, I was more than just a healer. It&#39;s probably the reason he feels very comfortable calling me even now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart did the stupid skip thing. But I didn&#39;t let any of my emotions show on my face. No, I didn&#39;t give her the satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;Jaris slept with so many women in the past. Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s nothing special about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She left the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words had barely sunk in when I heard a growl from the living room. I ran like my life depended on it,and just like I feared, it was Jaris losing control again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was on his knees, his hands continuously pulling at the chains. He wanted to break free by all means.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, that wasn&#39;t the scariest part. It was his eyes. They were completely red-a thick kind of red. One that was beyond his Alpha&#39;s redness. Those were feral eyes. He was so close to unleashing his beast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My legs wobbled, moving back on their own. I&#39;d never seen a sight like this. I was so scared I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Jaris. You don&#39;t need to do this. You know you don&#39;t want to,&#34; Ericka placed her hands up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Blood!&#34; He growled and tried again to break the chains.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;C-Can he break out?!&#34; | squealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not supposed to. Those are Cryptic Chains. No wolf should be able to break free of them,&#34; Ericka replied hastily without looking at mne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet I couldn&#39;t stop staring at the chains in fear like he could truly break out of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris thrashed on the floor, his growl animalistic. Aside from my fear,the sight was painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give him something!&#34; I yelled at Ericka</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve given him everything I can for today. It&#39;s more complicated this year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take long for the eager tears to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart broke over and over with each growl of pain Jaris made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Caden. I hated him with everything in me. Jaris didn&#39;t deserve to go through this. And if it wasn&#39;t for his stupid brother, we wouldn&#39;t be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took forever before the storm passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was far from calm, but at least, he seemned better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laid curled on his side, his body still jerking from time to time. My face looked like a blurred painting,drizzled with tears instead of paint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s still in pain,&#34; I whimpered, my arms wrapped around myself. &#34;How long does this have to go on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; Ericka answered honestly. &#34;Nothing seems to be working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him. No. Something must definitely work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34; Ericka asked, alarmed when she saw me going closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t reply to her but kept going, and she was too uncertain to try to stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went behind Jaris and laid on the floor, just beside him. &#34;Lyric! Have you lost your mind?!&#34; Ericka snarled,giving me the death stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can help him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snuggling myself up behind him, I put my arms around him, hugging him from behind. I held him like you&#39;d cuddle a lover in bed. Only this time, I wanted to siphon him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care about the consequences anymore. Didn&#39;t care if Ericka figured out what I was doing. I was done trying to hide my secret while Jaris suffered this torment right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris tensed the moment my hands touched him. I was taking a huge risk. He might choose to turn and attack me at any moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out of there, you foolish girl! He could kill you any minute! Are you trying to get me in trouble?&#34;Ericka hissed.</p>
