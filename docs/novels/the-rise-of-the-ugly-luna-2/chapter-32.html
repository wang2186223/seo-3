                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped out of the bar for a few minutes, but Jace was already in trouble.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Broken tables. Smashed glasses. Chairs flipped upside down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was in chaos as people struggled to separate the two men engaging in a serious brawl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, not again!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! Jace!&#34; I shouted, pushing my way through the mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Having a friendly conversation!&#34; he yelled back, just before dodging a punch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed his arm, trying to pull him away, but he shook me off like a damn wet leaf. They kept going at each other,tossing chairs, knocking over drinks-basically turning the bar into a battleground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How in Selene&#39;s name did this happen?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Nerion&#39;s intervention to bring an end to the madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in front of Jace, panting and glaring at both him and Kael. How could they do this in front of so many people?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need an apology from him. This instant! Before he steps a foot out of this place!&#34; Kael demanded angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Boy,was he pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace wiped blood from his lip with the back of his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Apology? Sure. I&#39;m sorry that your feelings are more fragile than a soap bubble.&#34; As usual, Jace&#39;s mouth knew how to make situations worse. &#34;I am telling you,&#34; Kael pointed a finger at him. &#34;If you don&#39;t apologize to me, you&#39;re not leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael, please!&#34; I stepped in. &#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry for whatever he did. Could you let it go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, stay out of this, Lyric. I don&#39;t have an issue with you. Your friend, however, seems to like them a lot,and I&#39;m here to show him just how much he can get from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on!&#34; Jace raised his hands. &#34;If you want to act like a little bitch, at least wear a dress to complete the look.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael lunged forward, but Nerion clamped a hand on his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,with Nerion&#39;s intervention, Kael was pulled away from the bar, leaving Jace alone. Now that I confirmed that Jace was safe, I let myself be mad at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s late. You should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked ahead of him, and then he caught up with me outside the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I didn&#39;t get to finish my drink. Who knows when next I&#39;d be seeing a free drink,&#34; he grumped to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>that seriously all you&#39;re bothered about?&#34; I whipped around so fast my hair nearly slapped him. &#34;Come on,Jace.What yo did in there wasn&#39;t cool!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how&#39;s it my fault? The dude attacked me, Ly. Was I supposed to just cross my arms and thank him for reconstructing my face?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I don&#39;t know what happened, but I damn know you&#39;re not innocent. I told you what Jaris said to me earlier. He doesn&#39;t want a scandal in any way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,your hair and face look perfectly fine. So, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re the one who got engaged in a fight. And trust me, I wasn&#39;t screaming your name while I was fighting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace!&#34; &#34;Goodnight, Lyric. Go on and have a beautiful sleep.&#34; He walked ahead of me. Suddenly,he paused and turned to me. &#34;But know this, the wine here is damn good. So, prepare to see more of me.&#34; He added and walked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared that Jaris would confront me regarding the fight and I&#39;d be in more trouble, but fortunately,he didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing because I had a bigger problem to worry about. Roderick&#39;s threat still hung over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed awake until late into the night, thinking of a way out of it. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to tell Jaris the truth. No. He was already of the opinion that I was loose and all. Confessing to him that I was someone else&#39;s rejected mate and was still currently bound to that person wasn&#39;t going to look good on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t let Jaris discover the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept thinking until I slept off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, I went to check on Xylon. He and Xyla were having breakfast in the dining room,looking smart in their uniforms. They were both excited to see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, today, I&#39;ll be going to get some herbs and other things we&#39;ll need to make you better.&#34; I happily informed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took up his writing tab, penning down on it. &#34;Will I really get better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was so much hope in his eyes. I was determined to do everything I could tomake sure he didn&#39;t get disappointed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile broadened as I tousled his hair. &#34;Yes, darling. You won&#39;t have to go through those painful epistles again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh! That&#39;d be so great, Aunty!&#34; Xyla clapped her hands. &#34;I really hope this works out.&#34; &#34;Step away from them.&#34; A cold,familiar voice suddenly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking ahead, I saw her entering the room like a queen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was corporately dressed, her heels clacking against the floor.Her eyes seemed to spit fire as she glared at the proximity between me and the kids. I was actually sitting next to Xylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calmly, I stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who let her in?&#34; She looked around at the two nannies in the room. &#34;Aren&#39;t you aware that my kids shouldn&#39;t be disturbed when they&#39;re eating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon and Xyla didn&#39;t just stop eating; their expressions went sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t blame it on the nannies. I think I have the right to be around Xylon, especially. Maybe you should speak to the Alpha for better clarification.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned brighter with resentment. &#34;I don&#39;t need to speak to anyone. You don&#39;t have the right to be around my kids without my consent.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? &#34;I just told you; I&#39;m taking care of-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, you treat him when it&#39;s necessary instead of throwing yourself at my kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped in shock.What!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted her eyes to the nannies. &#34;Bring them to the car. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked out of the room, arrogance radiating from every pore in her skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was something else. I sincerely hoped she wouldn&#39;t be giving mea tougher time here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, I was ready to go for Xylon&#39;s herbs. My mind drifted to Roderick and his stupid threat.Although, I&#39;ll admit-I was a little scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion was waiting outside with a car. &#34;Alpha Jaris wants you to go out with this,&#34; he handed the keys to me. &#34;And this.&#34; He handed a card next.&#34;It&#39;s a black card. You can pay for anything you want with it. The pin is two-two-five--five.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, this was interesting. Black cards were only used by the richest Alphas. From what I heard, only five Alphas in the world owned this, and it meant unlimited funds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, considering the fact that Jaris was ruling the highest-ranking Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for the card, but I think I can make use of my car.&#34; It was brought to me earlier that morning since Jace and I had arrived in his own car yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No offense, but the Alpha doesn&#39;t want you driving around in that when there&#39;s something better,&#34; Nerion said,surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? What was he talking about? Although it was my father&#39;s cheapest car, it wasn&#39;t bad at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No argument, Lyric. Just drive. Please.&#34; He really said it like a plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and made to open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need someone to come along?&#34; Nerion asked, holding the doors open for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. He was so gentle. Why couldn&#39;t his colleague, Kael, be like him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,thanks. I&#39;m good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was shut, and I hit the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I won&#39;t lie; this car felt good to drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a long drive from Darkspire to where I was headed, and I was relieved when I finally arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was known as Botanical Bliss-the biggest herb store in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon&#39;s condition was a very complicated one, one that was life-threatening. I&#39;d never dealt with it before,yet somehow, I knew of the right things to getthat could help. It was quite strange because this wasn&#39;t how the gift worked in my family. Usually, they&#39;d have to do research and all to know what they needed. But that wasn&#39;t the case with me. I already knew what was needed just by having a look at the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was always stunning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up a basket and went through the list I&#39;d drafted as I walked by the shelves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; Someone suddenly called in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped abruptly, realizing I&#39;d have bumped into this person if I had taken two more steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, I was met with a surprise. It was Alpha Zarek.</p>
