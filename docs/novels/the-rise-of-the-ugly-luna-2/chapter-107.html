                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest constricted when I heard the name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t exactly know what to feel. But I knew I was damn worried about the fact that he was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to him?&#34; I asked the doctor as we hurried toward the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He was stabbed. With a poisoned blade.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows. Who on earth stabbed him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We got into the elevator and waited for it to take us up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Wasn&#39;t there a doctor around to treat him?&#34;|wasn&#39;t asking because | didn&#39;t particularly want to be with him. I just thought there were plenty of doctors around that could&#39;ve attended to him instead of waiting for me. He was likely in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We tried to,&#34; Evans shrugged. &#34;He insisted on having you there.&#34; My heart raced in surprise. What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the doctor but didn&#39;t even know what to say to him. He wasn&#39;t the oneI should be staring at like that. It was Jaris. Why would he specifically ask for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All heads turned to me the moment I opened the door. The doctor wasn&#39;t lying. There were enough of them in here to treat him-his beloved baby mama included.So,why did he ask for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found him on the bed and my eyes quickly searched his body for the stab sound. It was easy to find on his chest. The shirt was soaked with blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Lyric, hurry up!&#34; Guinevere called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped hard as | ran to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What&#39;s wrong?&#34; | didn&#39;t even know who I was asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the room,&#34; Jaris said to the others. &#34;I&#39;m about to take off my shirt, and I can&#39;t do that with everyone staring at me.&#34; There was a smug grin on his face. For a moment, I wondered if he was really in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere nodded at me before exiting the room with two doctors. Marta stayed back. &#34;I told you there was no need for this, Jaris. I could&#39;ve had your wound checked already.&#34; The hurt in her voice was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked at her, his eyes seemed exhausted.&#34;I know you&#39;ve seen me shirtless, but I think we only need one doctor in the room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her hands tighten into fists. She glared at me like I was the one who just asked her to leave. But finally, she angrily left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was left with two nurses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to take your shift off,&#34; I said without looking at him as I wore my gloves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help the iciness in my voice. I might be worried about him right now, but seeing him was still a reminder of what he put me through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I turned back to him to take off the shirt,I realized he already did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard at the sight before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just the blood and deep stab wound. It was...everything</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chiseled abs were on full display, looking like a full course meal. It was the first time I was seeing him shirtless in daylight, and it was more than an appetizing sight. The man was handsome in every way. Too bad he was a rude jerk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a wet swab and started cleaning the blood.I was curious to know who stabbed him. But I&#39;d rather cut my tongue than ask Jaris that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I maintained a serious face as I worked on the wound Right now, I was here as his doctor, not the mate he terribly hated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re of any use here,&#34; he said dismissively to the nurses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped back and furrowed my brows at him.Who did he think he was to dismiss my nurses?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-&#34; But before I could complete my statement,they were already going out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously?! How could everyone be so afraid of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re no doctor,Alpha Jaris. It is my right to dismiss them or not,&#34; I tried to sound as polite as I could but failed. It was hard to keep my cool around this man anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You honestly didn&#39;t seem to need them&#34; He shrugged,so nonchalant I angrily grabbed a sterile saline to rinse the wound.&#34;Maybe it&#39;s because the wound isn&#39;t that serious to be here in the first place. There&#39;s a Pack doctor in Darkspire. You could&#39;ve used her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I wasn&#39;t saying this because I was angry. It was the truth. Yes, the blade was poisoned and he bled pretty well, but it was something that could&#39;ve been handled by the doctor. Why he&#39;d drive all the way to TCH to meet &#39;me&#39; was beyond me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even know if I was stabbed close to TCH.You&#39;re not so professional,are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows drew together. Was he... stabbed around here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I&#39;d rather chew stones than ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed him staring intently at me the whole time l worked. I tried to be as fast as I could so I could be away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still felt ashamed around him. The names he called me without remorse. What did I ever do to make him hate me so much? To make him lose so much trust in me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t been taking my calls. No replies to my texts either.&#34; My hands shook a bit when he spoke. Majorly because I was working so close to his face and could see how he stared right into my face. It was so close it was a bit uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a professional space, Alpha Jaris.&#34; I kept my voice as even as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re the only ones here, Lyric. Answer me.&#34;</p>
