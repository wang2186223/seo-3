                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was glad when my shift came to an end. My day had been ruined from the moment I healed that man that all I wanted to do was get home and have some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I passed by the room of the man I&#39;d healed, just to peep through the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he&#39;d ratted me out already.How was he even able to tell what I was?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slackened my steps when I neared the door and found Guinevere outside the room without another doctor. I couldn&#39;t make out what they were saying,but it bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if the man had told them and they were thinking of the best way to capture me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, stop it, Lyric. Stop being so negative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only it was that easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second doctor left before I got to the spot to meet Guinevere. I looked out for the woman&#39;s expression. This would determine if she knows something or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. How was your day?&#34; She sounded normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;I&#39;m fine, Doctor Guinevere.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced the window. The man was asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is he uh...better? I heard he was in a coma.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah, yes. He miraculously woke up today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I nodded, my stomach tightening with nervousness. &#34;How did that happen? I mean, did we have to do something special? Or did he-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s all thanks to Marta,&#34; she cut me off, speaking in a whisper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to wrap my head around the revelation. &#34;Wait,what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The man was her patient. And when I asked her, she said she had tried something new on him this morning which was the reason he regained consciousness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun, my mouth dropping open. What in the name of Selene? Marta was taking the glory for something she didn&#39;t do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I thought of it, Guinevere never asked questions concerning the surgery that was performed on Mr. Owens. I never wanted her to know it was me, but she never even tried to know who did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I see.&#34; I blinked rapidly, coughing to clear the sudden heaviness in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s quite good. And she wants it to remain a secret. Doesn&#39;t want the whole attention, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, for Selene&#39;s sake! Marta was more unbelievable than I thought. Of course, she&#39;d want it to remain a secret because it wasn&#39;t her doing!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Was she...also the one that performed surgery on Mr. Owens?&#34; Guinevere looked at me when I asked.&#34;You know, I&#39;d seenher go into the surgical ward but didn&#39;t know if...&#34; I shrugged, wanting her to complete the statement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to remain calm, but inside, I was burning with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere hesitated before nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, yes. She performed the surgery alone and didn&#39;t want anyone to know about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened like saucers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere must think I&#39;m shocked because I didn&#39;t know Marta could do such amazing things. She didn&#39;t know I was being shocked that Marta could be such a lying bitch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was taking the glory for what I did! And while I didn&#39;t want anyone knowing it was me, it still hurt to see someone lie confidently with my efforts. Could she be any worse?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s unbelievable,&#34; I huffed, but I didn&#39;t think Guinevere heard me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you say something,dear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. I&#39;d only be shooting myself in the leg if I told her Marta was lying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s the man? Has he said anything since hewoke up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She explained to me that he&#39;d mostly been sleeping and hadn&#39;t spoken much. She also told me who he was. He was just a regular member from a neighboring Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The few times he was awake, he&#39;s been insisting on meeting the doctor that saved him. So, Marta will be coming to see him soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a frantic beat. He wants to see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, Marta has claimed the glory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! What if he calls Marta what he called me? Or would he be able to tell that we&#39;re different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere&#39;s phone rang, and she excused herself to pick it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the man for some time. He was deep asleep. There was nothing I could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned home with this deep ache in my heart.I hated that I was this troubled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I should&#39;ve listened to Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped my bag on the bed and was about taking off my jewelry in front of the dresser when my eyes caught onto something on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed as I picked it up, wanting to have a clear look at it. And when I read the note, my breath froze.</p>
