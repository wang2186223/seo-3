                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage filled my bones. I never knew he had such an ugly side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about to shoot at another window when I got in the way. &#34;Fine! You&#39;ve made your point. Everything doesn&#39;t have to be about violence.&#34; I glared daggers at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at the broken glasses, then at me, his eyes devoid of emotion. &#34;Believe me, there is nothing violent about this. You&#39;ll know violence when you see one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart constricted with fury, so much that I wished I could pour it alI out on him. But who was I kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do we have an understanding, then?&#34; He asked,casually/putting his hands behind his back. &#34;We do. Now, put the gun away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More to my dismay, he pointed at another window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?? What was wrong with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; know daughters like you are usually ill-bred, but you must learn to speak to me with respect,considering the fact that you&#39;ll be associated with me for some time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed, feeling insulted. I opened my mouth to retort but instantly paused when he cocked the gun.His warning was clear: say another wrong word and lose more windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nails dug into my palms as I fisted my hands.How did I not see this part of him five years ago? How did he manage to be so deceptively calm and gentle?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand,&#34; I couldn&#39;t keep my tone from being scathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on me before he finally lowered his gun. He turned to father. &#34;I hope you do not mind the little display. It was necessary to make my point clear. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll take care of the repairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed at how arrogant he sounded, like he was doing my father a favour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked at me, I tore my gaze away, crossing my arms across my chest. &#34;Someone will be here to fetch you tomorrow. One p.m. Be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away, heading to his car. Using the opportunity, I glared heavily at his back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh! What a brute!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I was more concerned about having to live with him for a year. With how bad things were between us,I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I didn&#39;t make it out alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, father was angry over the fact that l had snubbed Jaris&#39; request to meet with me earlier.I had to remind him that if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that l was doing this for him, I&#39;d be long gone to my country. I didn&#39;t like it here. Not one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, now that I was likely to sign the contract,I needed to fully end things with Roderick. I couldn&#39;t become someone else&#39;s Luna if I still had some silly bond with another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him what felt like a hundred missed calls, but he ignored all of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, he called me at his own time in the evening, requesting to meet in a garden he owned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why aren&#39;t we just going to the temple? We could meet up there,&#34; I asked him over the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll go to the temple. I just need to show you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a slight argument, | agreed to meet with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than an hour, I arrived and found him in the VIP section, sitting alone in the middle of the garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such an ugly figure in the midst of beautiful flowers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Roderick had good looks, but his heart was not the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks for coming,&#34; I wasn&#39;t used to him being so polite. &#34;Please, take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t. &#34;I didn&#39;t come here to sit. What is it you wanted to show me? Be fast about it so we can go to the temple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you listen to me and just sit, Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; already told you No. Go straight to the point.Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez, it felt good to have my own will. How had I survived as the old Lyric?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.&#34; He took a deep breath. &#34;I want us to get back together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alarms went off in my head. For a moment, I was numb,his words taking longer than usual to register.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; | scoffed, batting my lashes. &#34;Sweet Seraphis, please tell me you&#39;re joking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have no reason to. Look, I know I was an asshole to you. I was rude,treated you with disdain... I&#39;m sorry,Lyric, I didn&#39;t know any better. But I promise you, I&#39;m ready to do better. If you could give me one more chance-give us one more chance-l promise it&#39;ll be the best decision of your life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop staring at him. I was actually tempted to touch him just to be sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming.Because how was this happening right now!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick Fletcher is asking me to get back with me?Oh, he&#39;s got to be kidding me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not joking,&#34; I mumbled, my forehead crinkling with a frown. &#34;You actually called me here to say this?Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are over!&#34; I yelled at him. &#34;You made that very clear when you threw me out of your Pack after using me to achieve your lame desires! For over a year, l lived like a slave! You wouldn&#39;t even let me look at you because you hated the sight of my face so much.I meant nothing to you, Roderick! And now, because Lyric is different, you suddenly want me back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up. &#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s not what you think. Look, l-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t wanna hear it!&#34; I held my hand to him,halting him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, just hearing him speak was grating on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re over, Roderick. We&#39;ve been over five years.Now, take me to the temple.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started walking away but stopped when I noticed he wasn&#39;t following. By the moon, I wasn&#39;t in for this drama today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roderick, what&#39;re you doing? I didn&#39;t come here for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face looked strict as he shook his head. &#34;I&#39;m not doing this, Lyric. I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ll have to get back with me. I&#39;m not severing the last bond we have.&#34;</p>
