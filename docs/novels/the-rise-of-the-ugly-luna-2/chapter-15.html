                <p>The door suddenly opened, bringing her to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jaris and his two assistants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the lady take some steps back, especially when Jaris&#39; eyes lingered on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; He slid his gaze between both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to tell him to ask his partner or whoever she was to him, but I let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were just having a conversation,&#34; she said, her gaze icy on me. &#34;But we&#39;re done here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned and left. I took a deep breath. Now, that is one problem out of the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the room seemed to heat up in an instant when Jaris&#39; eyes locked on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With me.&#34; He tilted his head and took the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed him to what looked like an office. Although,it was quite large-bigger than an average bedroom-and well furnished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were the only ones in-no assistants, nobody. And for some reason, that made me uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A drink?&#34; He asked as he poured some from the side table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No. I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He filled one glass for himself before taking a seat and urged me to mine which was in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris Dreadmoor.Who would&#39;ve thought?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went through some files before taking one of them out. &#34;Before we begin, I&#39;d like to know how good you are with treatments.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows, not quite getting him. &#34;I&#39;m aware you took care of my son the other day. What you did for him, it&#39;s something that usually takes us hours to achieve. And I heard it only took you minutes. Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How were you able to do it? Did you study this field in particular?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated on that. The truth was, I&#39;d only studied medicine for a year during the time I was away.lt wasn&#39;t enough time for anyone to get full knowledge,but from a young age, I&#39;d always had a passion for it.And when I encountered someone who started putting me through it, I discovered it was relatively easy for me. I could easily identify problems, know their immediate solutions, and it was always more effective when I did it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tutor was also surprised, but in the end, I got to understand that I&#39;d inherited the distinctive healing skills from my grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a rare gift that ran in the family. My mother and her siblings didn&#39;t get it. None of my cousins had gotten it either. I found it strange that out of everyone, I turned out to be the lucky one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been trying to keep this hidden as my kind was always in high demand. If people get to know, I&#39;d become more of a tool, and I didn&#39;t want that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;... actually have some knowledge in medicine,&#34; |answered after a slight hesitation. &#34;Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a gift from the moon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed for a second before he straightened his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But, do you think you can completely heal my boy? He&#39;s been sick with Nexopathy since he was two. I&#39;ve done all I could to get him the best doctor.DDo you think you&#39;ll be able to help?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should say No. But thinking about the state the little boy had been in the other day made my heart hurt for him. He didn&#39;t deserve to go through that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;His case seems to be a little rare,&#34; | supplied. &#34;But...with the right examination and research, I think l should be able to get to something good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And how long do you think that&#39;ll take?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was desperation in his eyes. Wow. Jaris Dreadmoor was desperate. I felt my heart warm. He did love his kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly don&#39;t know. Might take weeks or months.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His case was actually a serious one. If the epistles persist, he might not recover from one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris took a deep breath as he stared down at his table. When he looked at me again, his expression was taut, like the stoic Alpha I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These are the terms of our agreement,&#34; he slid the file to me. &#34;Take your time to study it and let me know if there are any concerns. But I want it signed before you leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Also, I&#39;m offering you a blank cheque in return for treating my son. If you&#39;re able to do it, to heal him completely,&#34; he chuckled, &#34;you&#39;ll be free to ask for anything in the world.&#34; I met his gaze and there was a clash as our eyes locked.Wow. What a tempting offer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I&#39;ll do my best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to open the file to gothrough it when the door opened behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart leapt as I turned around for a look. The two kids ran into the office, into the arms of Jaris.They were dressed in uniforms, indicating they&#39;d just returned from school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with a smile as Jaris fondly touched them,asking how their day was and all. He might be arrogant and a brute when he wanted to, but he sure knew how to handle his kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment there, I felt sad as my mind drifted to a dark painful corner. What if my kids had made it alive? Would Jaris have been happy to meet them?Would he have loved them just like he did Xylon and Xyla? Probably not. He already had a family he loved dearly. I was sure I&#39;d have only been intruding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the kids were done with him that they finally noticed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the nice aunty!&#34; Xyla spoke first, running to me.&#34;Hi! I was hoping I&#39;d see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, why did I feel so much joy each time l spoke with her? I loved it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy came to me next. &#34;Thank you,&#34; he muttered the words slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed he rarely spoke. Xyla did most of the talking when they were talking with their father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re welcome, handsome. How are you feeling today?&#34; It was taking me a lot of effort to hold back from touching his perfect curly hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Just have a little joint pain here...&#34; he pointed at his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla and Jaris looked surprised, as though they were not used to seeing the little boy communicate freely with strangers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Let&#39;s take a look at that.&#34; Taking the shoulder,I gave it a little squeeze, then held it for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made an &#34;ouch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Xylon, are you okay?&#34; His sister asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rolled his shoulder and seemed surprised. &#34;It feels very fine. I can&#39;t feel a thing! Thank you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, he took my hand, giving it a little squeeze. That simple gesture melted me more than I thought was possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, why did it feel so good?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at Jaris and he was staring back at me,and this time, there was amusement in his eyes.</p>
