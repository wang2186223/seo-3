                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arrived at the location in less than an hour. But there were no houses around as it looked more like a deserted street.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no sign of anyone at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about taking out my phone to text Caden when a black van pulled over. Two men came out of it,looked around, then took my bag from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Caden send you?&#34; I asked them but got no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arerr going through my bag, they ran a scanner through my body. They thought I had a tracker on me or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Into thevan,&#34; one tipped his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got in and we hit the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride was a long and tiring one. I couldn&#39;t even see where we were headed in the van.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the tie we drove into the compound and stepped out, I took note of my surroundings. This was smaller than the mansion he&#39;d previously been in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men led me into the house, right to the place where Caden was. My eyes rounded when I found him washing blood off his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me with a smile before returning his eyes to the sink where he washed his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. You probably won&#39;t understand how happy I am to see you again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t take my gaze off his hands. &#34;Whose blood is that?&#34; He cocked a brow at me, rounded up with the washing and started drying his hands with a towel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is Jaris?&#34; I looked around, starting to grow uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, wilI you? Jaris is fine. This is just the blood from someone who was proving to be stubborn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I gave him a suspicious look, keeping good distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; he threw the towel aside as he leaned against the counter. &#34;What made you come to your senses?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t come here to talk. Where&#39;s the contract? Let&#39;s get it over with so you can let Jaris go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you&#39;ll be signing the contract and get to live with me, we&#39;ll be doing a lot of talking. So maybe you should get used to it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept quiet but pinned my serious gaze on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the memo, he chuckled and dashed out to a room where he returned briefly with the scroll in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know you can&#39;t sign it now. It needs to be at night. There would be a full moon tonight, fortunately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I just want to go through it.&#34; Opening my palm to him, he handed the contract while I took a good look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Basically, I was meant to serve him and do his bidding. I&#39;d also have nothing to do with Jaris and his people.This was like asking me to become an enemy with the very people that&#39;s been family to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to add something,&#34; I said when I finished reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll only sign this if you include a promise never to touch me against my will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The light vanished from his eyes, like it was an intention be already had in mind. Suddenly, I felt.grateful |brought it up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i went on. &#34;I can serve you and do your bidding, but that will, in no way, include sexual bidding. Add to this to the contract and I&#39;ll sign it with my blood when the Moon is out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, he kept his cold eyes on me. Suddenly, he chuckled and moved away, going to the wine counter just by the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think that rule is necessary? What makes you think I&#39;d want to force myself on you?&#34; He asked as he poured himself some wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,you&#39;re already forcing me do a lot of things. There are limits to the things I can be forced on, Caden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glass filled, he turned around and pinned me with his stare while he leaned against the counter and drank his wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering the glass from his lips, he dragged his eyes through my body in a way that made me feel uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips lifted in a smirk. &#34;You&#39;ll be with me for a long time, Lyric. You sure you want to rule intimacy out if it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his gaze even as anxiety washed over me and took a step toward him. &#34;Your brother is the only man that&#39;s ever touched me, and I intend to keep it that way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the dark glint that replaced the smirk in his eyes. Good. He needed to understand there were certain things Jaris had that he could never own no matter how hard he tried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see, Caden,&#34; I crossed my arms. &#34;You could force me to be here, force me to use my powers, but my body and heart will never be yours. There are certain things you can never take from Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, I was playing with fire. Caden looked very angry and could hit me at this moment. But to hell with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, tell me please. Do we have a deal? Or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nightfall, Caden had included the rule in the contract. With the full moon, we both stood beneath it, the contract in hand. He still wouldn&#39;t let me see Jaris until the process was over. This was why I was eager to get it done and see how Jaris was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small blade was presented to us. We intoned a series of sacred phrases, then I went first by making a cut on my hand, dipped the feather into my blood and signed on the page that required my signature.The blood dried up immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden did the same with his blood, the both of us officially binding ourselves to this contract with the Moon being our witness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt disgusted at the end of it. But not Caden. He looked victorious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now take me to him.&#34; I gritted at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t be in such a hurry, Lyric. Remember you&#39;re about to say a painful goodbye to him. Or are you excited for that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared daggers at him.He chuckled as he led the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally getting to see Jaris&#39; face was a breath of relief in a stuffy room. Like someone who had been trapped underwater for so long and only just broke the surface.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried to his side where he laid on the bed. He looked like he was deep asleep, just like Caden had been all those years ago when I found him in the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this painful for him-l wondered fearfully. What if he was trapped in a dream, one where he constantly seek escape?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cradled his face, a tear slipping through as I thought of turning away from him. It was crazy how a person&#39;s plan could change so drastically. Only two weeks ago, we&#39;d been planning to elope. And today, I was about to say goodbye to what we shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll give him the antidote now, Lyric. I&#39;m sure you know what to do. Remember, we have a signed contract.You can&#39;t mess this up,&#34; Caden warned from behind me.</p>
