                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know where Jaris was in this huge hall. And I didn&#39;t want to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the party would be fun. And since he wouldn&#39;t come with me, I decided to come alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, Jace got very busy and couldn&#39;t make it. But I didn&#39;t let even that stop me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the attention I garnered from the guests.Tonight, I really wanted to have fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to find two smiling ladies before me</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; I furrowed my brows but wvaved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t look familiar. Although, they were richly dressed,letting me know they were important figures.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One was light skinned and the other dark. But they were both very beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re Lyric, right?&#34; The lighter one asked. &#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Juan. And this is...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Becky. I can introduce myself, J.&#34; The dark one rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, we&#39;ve had our eyes on you for some time now.&#34;Juan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean,you&#39;re pretty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And Jaris&#39; mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. I liked the way they spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I&#39;m Rhys&#39; mate,&#34; Juan said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nice meeting you.&#34; I extended my hand, and they gladly took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They joined me at the counter, and just like that, we got talking like we had known each other for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, what is it like being mated to Jaris? Is he a bit romantic?&#34; Becky asked, unsettling me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Can&#39;t really say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Sorry if you feel bothered. It&#39;s just that... we didn&#39;t think Jaris would have a mate. Of course,he needed a Luna as an Alpha, but we didn&#39;t think he had it in him to be even a bit loving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need to love someone to make them your mate, Beck.&#34; Juan nudged her. &#34;Are you forgetting that most Lunas suffer a loveless union with the Alphas?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mine was worse than lovelessness. He hated me. And he was only going to use me for a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The MC suddenly climbed the stage, announcing the dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oops. Time to leave you ladies alone. I need to go dance with my birthday boy.&#34; Juan winked at us and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| guess someone like me would have to wait for a Prince charming to approach me.&#34; Becky made a pout.&#34;Um... don&#39;t you think you should be dancing with Alpha Jaris? Although, he did come with Marta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not dancing,&#34; I took a sip from my glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Couples were already filling the dance floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; A young man walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know his name, but I knew he was an Alpha. He held out his hand. &#34;Can I have this dance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath froze for a moment. I wasn&#39;t sure Jaris would like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Jaris is here with Marta!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;And you&#39;re here to have fun.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.Fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Smiling, I took the Alpha&#39;s hand, and he took me to the stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers hit the stage, and together, we danced according to the rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept scouring my eyes around the stage, looking for him and the woman he choose over me. But | couldn&#39;t find them. Shouldn&#39;t they be dancing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite beautiful, Lyric,&#34; my dance partner whispered in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hear you&#39;re Jaris&#39; mate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffen.Geez! It felt like everyone knew me already as his mate. How sad. &#34;He&#39;s a lucky man, I must say. If I had met you before him, I&#39;d have fought tooth and nail to get you by my side.&#34; He chuckled, trying to make it sound like a joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only I knew he wasn&#39;t joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have a mate?&#34; I raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I do. But with a face like yours, I&#39;d reject her in the twinkle of an eye.&#34; He laughed again. But this time,it wasn&#39;t funny. I detest men like him. Men like Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about pulling away from his grasp when Jaris-shockingly-appeared beside us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I startled, taking a moment to regain my calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris.&#34; My partner stopped moving with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dance was still ongoing, and it was awkward that the three of us just stood there, unmoving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With me, Lyric. Now.&#34; He spoke in that tone that usually brooked no room for argument. That tone that told me he was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I excused myself from the Alpha and went after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Jaris out, into the cold night air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing, Lyric?&#34; He stopped as soon as we were far from the noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around before lifting my hands up and down.&#34;I don&#39;t think I follow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You being here.&#34; He slipped one hand into his pocket.I could tell he was fighting to keep his cool.&#34;You dancing with the men and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, am I also not allowed to come to parties myself when you wouldn&#39;t wanna go with me? Does my life revolve around you now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped toward me. &#34;You don&#39;t interrupt me when I&#39;m talking,Lyric. Never.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I balled my hands into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I forced my voice to sound as clear as possible. &#34;I&#39;d like to go back to the party if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric! Don&#39;t make me do something crazy!&#34;He snapped, turning me back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly do you want from me!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re my Luna now! Almost everyone knows this.And while I don&#39;t want to give a shit about what you do with your time, I can&#39;t have you bring more shame to my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More shame? What was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right now, I&#39;d rather you go home. But if you choose to stay, then you must make sure you&#39;re not even a hundred feet close to any man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes turned glossy as I gave him that ridiculous stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think it&#39;s cool that you get to set the rules!?&#34; I half-yelled. &#34;Just incase you have no idea, Alpha Jaris, it is utterly tiring that I get to be treated like trash while you get away with so many things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think you&#39;re being treated like trash...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I cut him off. Oh, to hell with the rules! &#34;First,you show up late to our mating ceremony and act like I was a slave who was being forced on you. You didn&#39;t even give me an explanation. Instead, you slept wvith Marta that night. You slept with another woman!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand...I understand that it&#39;s all a contract and we have no business in each other&#39;s lives. But it was our first night being mated. Did you have to do that!?&#34;Tears streaked my cheeks. &#34;Be so mean? You get to break the rules while I get treated like trash. Why don&#39;t we both live fairly, huh? Why don&#39;t you let me live freely, as much as you do? Why don&#39;t you free me from these chains!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dabbed my tears. &#34;I didn&#39;t deserve what you did to me. It was more than a betrayal, Alpha. You fucking hurt me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; Someone called behind me. I noticed his gaze also shift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I turned, Marta was there, looking concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face as I turned back to Jaris. &#34;Your date is here. Why don&#39;t you go back to her while I find something else to do with my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a bit stunning-his silence. But I didn&#39;t bring myself to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just walked away from them both, heading to my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I hated my life. I hated ever coming back home.And I hated ever listening to my father and going to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was pissed. Throughout the remaining hours of the party, I only kept myself busy with drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric&#39;s words replayed in my head. She thought she had the right to be angry? After everything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And oh, she even thought I slept with Marta that night.I was tempted to laugh at her at that point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obviously, it hurt her. And I liked it. At least, she got a taste of what she made me go through that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been compelled to confront her about what she did,but ifI did, things would get really bad between us.She probably thinks I don&#39;t know what she did. She thinks her secret is safe with Zarek. If I bring it up and we talk about it; I watch her cry and apologize, I&#39;ll never be able to look her in the face again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason I&#39;m still able to tolerate her sometimes is because she hasn&#39;t confessed to it herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for the party to end before I desired to go home. I left with my people and didn&#39;t say a word the entire ride, not even when Marta had tried to strike a lake conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed to my bathroom, taking a quick shower and ignoring the bulge in my pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I changed into my nightwear and decided to check for updates on my laptop. Turned out there were some rogue attacks an hour ago, though it was far from Darkspire. I was checking for more updates when Nerion knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss.&#34; He entered. He always preferred calling me boss to Alpha. &#34;Thought you&#39;d like to know that Lyric is not back yet.&#34;</p>
