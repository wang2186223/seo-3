                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, please.&#34; I tried to sit up, but they kicked me on the shoulder, forcing me back down. I landed with a painful grunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other got on top of me, his legs on either side of my waist. I felt disgusted immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my neck, and as quickly as | could,I pushed open the silver pocket knife I&#39;d taken from my seat and stabbed him in the neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He growled as he stumbled back, away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking bitch!&#34; One of the other two rasped and kicked me in the belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I curled into a ball, my hand flying to my midriff as a low growl left me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Please,I don&#39;t want any trouble,&#34; I whimpered,but they weren&#39;t listening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one I&#39;d stabbed was writhing on the ground. No doubt he wasn&#39;t going to make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the two guys remaining grabbed my hair and dragged me to my feet. He punched me in the ribs this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face contorted in agony as the pain radiated throughout my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears fell from my eyes, and in that moment, I thought of using my powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like Jace said, being a Siphon, I could do a lot of things-including siphoning someone&#39;s oxygen. I could kill these men right now and save myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But aside the fact that I never wanted to use my power to harm people, I also didn&#39;t know how to do it.All I knew was siphoning illnesses. I knew nothing about siphoning anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to give it a try. I grabbed the man&#39;s hand in my hair and wished I could take his oxygen away. But I didn&#39;t even know what I was doing. It didn&#39;t work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second wolf punched me across the face, making me to release a painful cry. I&#39;d have dropped to my knees, but the other still holding my hair wouldn&#39;t let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was about hitting me again when a car pulled over in front of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to cry in relief. This had to be some sort of help.Right? I was right. It just wasn&#39;t who I&#39;d have ever expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming out of the car was Alpha Zarek and three guards. They looked at the scene with confusion and shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two wolves with me most know that they were outnumbered because they tried to get them to leave.&#34;Keep driving. I won&#39;t say it again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered at the thought of Alpha Zarek actually leaving me in their hands. He had no reason to help me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows tightened as he took in my beaten form. My hand was still holding my midriff and I was sure there might be bruises on my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go. Now.&#34; His voice was like steel when he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The boy shoved me to the ground, making me bruise my elbow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I tried to warn you,&#34; he shrugged, looking at Zarek.&#34;We&#39;ll just go back to her when we finish with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The fight started. The strange wolves fought with frightening strength, but in the end, Zarek and his guards managed to defeat them. I was already on my feet before Zarek came to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay? Were you hurt too much?&#34;He held my shoulders, giving me a thorough look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nodded, too shocked to form words. I nearly died! If he hadn&#39;t done when he did, I&#39;d have died! By some strange blood sucking wolves!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at my car on the road and shook his head.&#34;Were you heading home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my arms around myself, looking around uncomfortably. What if there were more? What if I don&#39;t make it this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. I&#39;ll take you to the pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a normal day, I&#39;d have never agreed to be anywhere near this Alpha. But tonight, I didn&#39;t even hesitate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly grabbed my bag and phone and hurried to the front seat of his car, still looking around for any danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His guards didn&#39;t drive with us as he ordered them to take care of the bodies and try to know where those men came from. He also asked them to get my car to someone who could fix it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was overly nice. I should&#39;ve stopped him. But not tonight. Tonight, I was too shocked to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the second time I&#39;d been so close to death.The first time was when l&#39;d been burnt on the face with silver. I was so young, and it had been so painful l thought I was going to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the fear I felt tonight was even more than I&#39;d felt that day. Tonight, I really almost died.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should go to your Pack doctor as soon as you get home,&#34; Zarek said after a while. &#34;But who were those people? What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I sniffled that I realized I&#39;d been crying.But fortunately, since we were away from the scene,I could find my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. They just... I mean, I just bumped into them on the road, sucking off those people. Then,they attacked me and tried to do the same with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel Zarek&#39;s surprise as he looked at me.&#34;What do you mean sucking off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled again. &#34;Their blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t understand. How&#39;s that possible?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind drifted to the attack Jaris had told me about few days ago. Back then, he only said they&#39;d found bite marks on the necks of the victims. He didn&#39;t mention their blood being sucked. Was it possible the attack had been done by these same people? What if those bite marks were there because their blood had been sucked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my whole years of existence, I&#39;d never heard of a wolf that could suck from another. It shouldn&#39;t even be possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were soon approaching the gates of Darkspire.I felt more safe now that I was home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;For saving me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s nothing,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards stopped him at the gates, but there was someone else out there. Jaris, Kael and two other guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so much better seeing Jaris. I couldn&#39;t wait to tell him about the attack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. You don&#39;t have to go in. I&#39;ll just take it from here,&#34; I said as I reached for my bag. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, you&#39;ve done a lot tonight. Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the car,going to meet Jaris who seemed to have been having a deep conversation with his people. But he stopped as he watched me approach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the dark glint in his eyes. He looked pissed.Maybe he was because I was home late and he had been trying to reach me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where have you been, Lyric?&#34; He cut me off, his voice like steel.</p>
