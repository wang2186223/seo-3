                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dominance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wholelife, I&#39;d always craved for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My family had a history of producing the highest ranking Alphas. So, it was easy to grow up feeling in control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But from young, I&#39;d always craved to be the dominant one in every way. It is the reason I was doing better than my predecessors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, for the first time in my life, there happened to be someone who seemed to challenge me. Someone who grated on my nerves and tempted me to draw blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was not who I am. I was always feared and respected. So,how dare she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left for the funeral in an irritable mood. Oh, this was not over. Lyric Harper would pay dearly for what she did today. I&#39;d make share of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We took my private jet to Blystara, and the funeral was nothing short of what I had expected. Luxury.High dignitaries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King Thaddeus may have died an early death, but it was known in our tradition to give funerals of high ranking Alphas the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed the room go a degree colder the second I walked in with Kael and Nerion. The people paused for a moment, their beady eyes watching me as l made my way in. It was nothing new. I usually had this effect on people. It was easy with the kind of rumours that had been brewed against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris Dreadmoor,&#34; someone called, coming toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Clark, the late King&#39;s brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a bright smile as he dipped his head slightly. Well, Clark might have been a brother to the King,but he always respected me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clark.&#34; I acknowledged with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to have you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, the mood in the room returned to normal. Everyone was back to having their normai chatters and laughters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other Alphas soon joined Clark and 1. I noticed tonight, they were trying hard tobe friendlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me that a lot of them had expectations of me becoming the future Alpha King. Hence,everyone suddenly wanted to get in my good books.Formerly, all they did was avoid me. But now, they wanted to be close to me. How ironic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the Alphas and I discussed the circumstance surrounding the Alpha King&#39;s death and howhi tragic it was to lose a man like him so soon. Although, they did more of the talking while I kind of listened.Suddenly, the room went cold again. But this time, it wasn&#39;t because someone terrifying had entered.I could tell from the stunned look at the people&#39;s faces as they stared at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I equally turned, and for a moment, there was a tightening in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming through the door, next to Alpha Bennett was his daughter, my future Luna. And if she wasn&#39;t the most stunning sight I&#39;d ever seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers tightened around the glass of wine I held,my jaw clenching. She looked gorgeous, her long black dress, filled with silver stones at the cleavage hugged her curve so perfectly she looked like and hourglass. Her hair was styled into a messy bun,some strands falling over close to her big round green eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric Harper was the most good looking lady I&#39;d ever seen-I knew that from the very first day I set eyes on her. Yet, she&#39;s the first woman to challenge me. 1loved women with fire, but I hated how she directed hers at me.&#34;Well, that is one gorgeous sight,&#34; The Alpha beside me said,dreamily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got on my nerves. But I couldn&#39;t blame them all for admiring her. No woman in the room had looked that good until now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look in my direction to notice me and stayed close to her father. It took the room a while longer to get over the scene and resume their normal conversations, although a lot of them still stole glances at her from time to time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might break that glass,&#34; Nerion whispered in my ear from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until that moment that I realized I had been grabbing the glass too tight. I wrinkled my nose in irritation as I dropped it on the tray of a passing waiter and tried to take my mind off the stubborn woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t believe she was mad at me for saving her back at the club. I&#39;d seen the boys following her to the restroom, heard her scream and as soon as the door went open, the asshole had his hand around her waist. Could she be any less grateful? Wasn&#39;t it obvious they were planning on hurting her? Or did she enjoy being around so much men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her father was taking her around, introducing her to some of the top Alphas. Now what was his problem?Why was he acting like she needed some stupid connections when she already had me? I was the highest connection she could get; the top tree that connected to other branches. Alpha Bennett really needs to stop getting on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after, they got to our spots. Of course, I&#39;d been standing with three top Alphas. The man would want to introduce his daughter to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was he aware that I hated sharing my women? It was a harmless introduction but not one I welcomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed her go nervous as soon as they stopped before us. Her eyes only caught onto mine for two seconds before she was forced to look away. But not me.I kept my eyes on her, right on her face. Her father exchanged greetings with the Alphas.He greeted me as well, but all I did was nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he introduced Lyric to them as his daughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Bennett. I had no idea you had such beauty in your family,&#34; one said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks like she&#39;d make a perfect wife for my son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every nerve in my body tensed. If I had been holding a glass at this point, I was sure I&#39;d have crumpled it to pieces.</p>
