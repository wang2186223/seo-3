                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until Jaris and I were away from the bank that all the nervousness I&#39;d been bottling away came flooding out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My palms were sweaty and shaky. I rubbed them on the sides of my jeans, taking deep breaths and reminding myself I was fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Lyric. Nobody will dare hurt you,&#34; Jaris said reassuringly when we reached the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears came freely as I dug my shaky hands into my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m just... I&#39;m just overwhelmed,&#34; I chuckled.&#34;You stood up for me in there, against every single person.&#34;My voice broke. &#34;Am I worth it,, Jaris? T-The people might be against you for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I felt like a bad luck. His first day as King and he was already going against the entire council for my sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care. Listen, Lyric,&#34; he took my hand. &#34;I already plan on erasing this stupid law that paints your kind as dangerous. From tomorrow after we&#39;ve moved in, I&#39;ll start working on it and get the Council to agree with me. As soon as the law is erased, you&#39;ll be completely safe. But I&#39;m telling you thnat even right now, nobody will dare lay a hand on you, not when l&#39;ve paused the order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded so sure. And of course, as King, it was forbidden for anyone to try to go against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still,I couldn&#39;t help the fear that coiled itself around my throat, making it almost impossible for me to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t help this strong feeling that something might go wrong somehow. I didn&#39;t want to die. But l also didn&#39;t want to leave Jaris yet. Not now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After much conviction, I was able to get Lyric to fly back to Darkspire where she could gather her things.I had Kael keeping a close eye on her as I still didn&#39;t trust her to not attempt an escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for me, I had to stay back here to do certain things.There were a lot of records I had to go over with the Council,so many things I needed to catch up with. I didn&#39;t miss how uncomfortable the Elders were around me during the meeting. They probably saw me as someone who was keeping a monster safe.Well,I guess it would&#39;ve mattered if I gave a damn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Defending Lyric earlier had turned out to be easier than I thought. But really, did they think I&#39;d have just folded my arms and let them hurt her? Didn&#39;t they know what she meant to me? What exactly was wrong with them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew it wasn&#39;t over. The Executioners were not one to back off easily. They&#39;d definitely press some more to get what they want-which was Lyric&#39;s life.This was why I needed to push the agenda as soon as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d been having a meeting for over two hours and decided to go on a small break. I returned to the room to grab some water, and to my displeasure, my mother was sitting there, waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Finally, you&#39;re back.&#34; She stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her angry mood already told me what she wanted to talk about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am not done, mother. And believe me, I do not have the time for this-&#34; &#34;No,Jaris! We&#39;re going to have this conversation!&#34; She snapped. &#34;Why on earth&#39;s name are you protecting that girl?! She&#39;s a Siphon! A forbidden thing! Have you forgotten so soon what they did to our family? Her kind is the reason you and your brother have suffered!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And do you know how many other people have suffered because of Caden and I?&#34; | cut her off. &#34;Do you have any idea about the lives that&#39;s been lost because of us? People die everyday, mother. But so far,Lyric has been no murderer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,really now? You seem to be forgetting she killed that Executioner!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She never meant to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And she&#39;ll never mean it when she does something more dangerous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stormed closer to me. &#34;Please, Jaris; do not tell me you&#39;re going to ignore this simply because you&#39;ve been with her for what? Three months? You just became King! You cannot afford to be biased right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. I looked crazy, and even my mother stared at me like I&#39;d lost my mind. And maybe I had</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I eventually stopped laughing and addressed her, my tone was icier. &#34;Lyric and I may have known each for only a few months, but she&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve been to anyone, mother. The connection I feel with her,I never felt it even with father. And definitely not with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, how could I feel it when growing up, she had been too focused on being a feared Luna rather than a caring mother? She didn&#39;t even notice when Caden and I drifted apart to fix us. All that ever mattered to her was power and making sure one of her sons stayed in it. It didn&#39;t matter which son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth smacked her like a blunt object. Her lips parted in shock, more from the fact that I could utter such words to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concluding she&#39;d be too shocked to say any more words, I left her in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did fate have to be so cruel to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to lose my mother at a young age, got branded with silver and grew up with the &#39;ugly&#39; tag. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, I had to be a Siphon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bad news does travel faster. It looked like the entire world already knew I was a Siphon, because everywhere I turned, there were suspicious eyes on me. The people were keeping their distance like I was a plaque that could harm them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace who was holding my hand beside me, gave it a little squeeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Lyric. This will pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only he knew how reassuring his presence next to me was. I honestly wouldn&#39;t know what to do if a friend wasn&#39;t closeby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We parted ways when we got to the hallway dividing our rooms as he also had to get his things from his own room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I was so hungry and had to go get something from the Pack&#39;s restaurant. I was approaching a corner when I heard the muffled voices of maids cheerfully greeting someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings,Grand Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Make sure you put the rest of the items together,&#34; I recognized Marta&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Grand Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what about the other things I asked for? Have they been brought yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes,Grand Luna.&#34; I heard departing footsteps. My own steps had slowed as I contemplated if it was a good idea to go ahead and meet with her. I wasn&#39;t sure I wanted to deal with her right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get the chance to decide as she came up the corner to meet me. She paused, seeming surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were two maids behind her, one holding a tray of fruits and the other a glass of juice. How pleasant.I could imagine she was living her best life right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you come back?&#34; She raised a brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help scoffing at her. &#34;I came to get my things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her chin higher. &#34;I think you forgot something.&#34; Her lips lifted in a smirk. &#34;You forgot to pay me some respect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. I&#39;d seen this coming. Which was why I had thought of avoiding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Lyric. Don&#39;t make me force you for something that is necessary. I am no longer Marta Monroe-Jaris&#39; baby mama. I am his fucking wife! The Grand Luna of our world!&#34; She cackled. &#34;Can you imagine how sweet that is?&#34; She stepped closer, her gaze holding mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, address me as a grand Luna. Else, trust me,you wouldn&#39;t like how this would turn out for you.&#34;</p>
