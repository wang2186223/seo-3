                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me!?&#34; My voice rose a notch,tears starting to hit the back of my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;An apology.&#34; His eyes nor words held no emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For not keeping me updated on such a huge step.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you told me to stay away from you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, you should&#39;ve sent a text or something. I just hate that I had to hear it from someone else, Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, damn it. Luna Isolde is a very pretty woman,but she did a poor job raising her son. He was a manipulative monster!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I ground the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed away from the table, coming toward me.&#34;I can&#39;t hear you, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? I looked up at him, same time a stupid tear came rolling down my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said... I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was humiliating to know I was apologizing even when he was the one that had done me wrong. Over and over again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ate up the distance between us until there was nothing left separating us. Then,he stared down at me.Since he was so tall and I wasn&#39;t, it was easy peering down at me like I was beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; His tone was clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed his eyes trail to my lips again. But he looked away just as quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without uttering another word, he shouldered past me,walking out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Making sure my face was clean of any of the pathetic tears I&#39;d shed for him, I went out to look for Guinevere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was with Marta who threw deadly glares my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can see you&#39;re done.&#34; Guinevere turned to me. &#34;Ms.Monroe will take it from here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Marta out of the ward, curious to know what was next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before you get accepted, we&#39;ll have to test you.&#34; She hit the elevator button. &#34;It&#39;s standard procedure. We&#39;ll see how well you perform, which would determine if you get to join us or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took us to the ground floor, into a surgical ward I found a doctor inside and three others standing and watching from outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I asked in a tone only Marta could hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged casually. &#34;You claim to be so good at what you do. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t have a problem proving to the team how good you are with surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped. &#34;What? But I never told you l was good at surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you kept hinting at the fact that you&#39;re better than me. Besides, I already told them you&#39;re a pro at surgery, Lyric. It&#39;d be disastrous if you told them you couldn&#39;t do it now. Believe me, they&#39;ll kick you out without second thoughts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. This was a set up. She was looking for a way for me to give up myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smirked as she walked into the ward. I glanced at the people watching from outside, staring at me with beady eyes. They looked like the kind of people that would look out for your failure rather than your success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I went in with Marta. &#34;And just so you know,&#34; she tilted her head to my side so me alone could hear her. &#34;He&#39;s sick with Moonlit Affliction. It&#39;s at its terminal stage, which is why a lot of us here have been unwilling to help him. No one wants the blood of someone as powerful as him in our hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the unfamiliar face of the old man asleep on the bed. &#34;Wh-Who&#39;s he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Zarek&#39;s father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at her with disbelief. It&#39;d be very bad if the retired Alpha gets to die in my hands. I didn&#39;t even know what Zarek&#39;s deal was with me yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor in the room came up to me with a nurse beside her, holding some materials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Dreadmoor. We&#39;ve been expecting you,&#34; the doctor said with a warm smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Marta roll her eyes when the woman called me by Jaris&#39; name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse handed me a coat and some surgical gloves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Monroe tells us you&#39;re very good at this,&#34; the nice doctor said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yeah.&#34; I guess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I was so nervous. I&#39;d never operated on anyone before. And the man&#39;s condition seemed serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was evil. She was setting me up for failure so I&#39;d never get accepted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nice doctor went ahead to brief me on the surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be here to guide you. Just in case things go, you know, haywire.&#34; She concluded with a smile and a tap on my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; I managed to smile back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked back at the window, doctor Guinevere had joined the others watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There wNere so many eyes now. I couldn&#39;t fail in front of them. I&#39;d lose this job.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta came closer to me, as if to reassure me.She whispered in my ear. &#34;Now, show them how much of a loser you are, Lyric.&#34;</p>
