                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My patient was sick with Chrono-Flux Displacement and had been in this condition for eleven years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite our strong immune system as wolves, there were still some unbeatable sicknesses and poisons.It was sad that some people even ended up losing their lives.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The team was ready when I walked into the ward.Guinevere and two other doctors stood outside the window,watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was my second chance. I couldn&#39;t mess it up like I did the first time. The doctors woud definitely lose faith in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed up late, rehearsing every process. I was wearing my abyssal gloves today as I didn&#39;t want to make contact. I won&#39;t be siphoning the man&#39;s sickness,but at least, the surgery would be successful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started the process, praying deeply not to panic like the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please,Lyric. You have to get this right. After an hour, the surgery ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I dropped my suture that I realized it was successful. I didn&#39;t flinch!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed happily as I looked at the window. Outside,Marta had joined the doctors watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere looked pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes! I did it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The patient would definitely take longer to heal compared to if I&#39;d touched him, but he&#39;d be fine.Even without me siphoning his sickness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Lyric. That was awesome,&#34;Guinevere said when I walked out of the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dipped my head and headed for the restroom where I got rid of my gloves and washed my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt better. Not entirely happy, but better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was headed for my office and was about to round a corner when I heard voices. More importantly,I heard my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling you, he doesn&#39;t fee a thing for her. Marta is the one with kids for him. She&#39;s more important than Lyric,&#34; a female voice said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. But why didn&#39;t he just make Marta his Luna,then? Sure, Lyric is prettier, but Marta is also very beautiful. She&#39;s intelligent. Hardworking. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d have made a better Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knot of nausea coiled tightly within me, twisting in protest against the unsettling things I heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think Lyric forced herself on him?&#34; A new voice asked. &#34;I mean, Jaris is the most powerful Alpha.Even I would throw myself at him at the slightest chance. Do you think it&#39;s possible Lyric&#39;s family was so power hungry,they forced her on him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It makes sense. It&#39;d explain why he was so late even to his own mating ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gosh. She&#39;s so shameless. How does she feel now that she&#39;s with a man who might never love her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind spun, overwhelmed by the relentless barrage of assumptions crashing around me. I couldn&#39;t believe this was what I&#39;d been reduced to-someone who forced herself on Jaris?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words cut through me, hurting as much as it did when I&#39;d been called ugly all those years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped into the corner, letting them see me. The conversation stopped abruptly. There was an initial The three of them were fellow doctors like me.I couldn&#39;t believe they could hang around and gossip about someone who had been nice to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I&#39;d been nice. I always greeted them with warm smiles when we bumped into each other. I&#39;ve always admired them from afar. How could they be so cruel?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aren&#39;t there better things to do instead of hanging around and saying things that are of no concern to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; One of them scoffed. Kayla. She was the one I&#39;d admired most among the trio. &#34;We were only having a conversation. Don&#39;t you think it was wrong to have eavesdropped, Mrs. Dreadmoor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the way she called the second name with mockery. I put my hands into the pockets of my lab coat so I could fist them without them seeing. I didn&#39;t want them to see the effect they had on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other two-Margot and Celine-simply gawked at me without any ounce of remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I&#39;m the one at fault?&#34; I huffed. &#34;This is a professional space, doctor Kayla. You of all people should know more about work ethics.&#34; &#34;Please,&#34; she rolled her eyes. &#34;We were merely passing time. Besides, it isn&#39;t like a single lie was told,was it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kayla, I think we should just go.&#34; Celine tried to hold her hand,but the arrogant nurse didn&#39;t let her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;I can&#39;t have someone point fingers at me like I did something wrong. We all talk about people, and not a single loir was said about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re right; her mate did come late to the ceremony.Have you seen the chemistry between him,Marta and the kids? They&#39;re like the perfect family. And this right here, if you ask me,&#34; her eyes burned with defiance as she looked down at me. &#34;is like one of those women you&#39;d call a home wrecker.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was seething with rage. But this was a professional ground. There wasn&#39;t much I could do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;ve said enough.&#34; I stepped toward her,trying to hide the pain in my voice. &#34;Kayla Sky, there&#39;s no telling what I&#39;d do if you say one more word about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you know it&#39;s the truth,&#34; Margot rolled her eyes.&#34;It&#39;s obvious you got mated to Alpha Jaris for power I wonder how you intend to live for the rest of your life,knowing his heart belongs to another.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that very painful stab, they walked out on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran to my office, locking the door and bursting into tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It freaking hurt. It hurt so much to hear the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I wasn&#39;t so sure they were lies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In what way would Jaris ever pick me over the mother of his kids? In what world would I ever be important to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the end of my shift, I called Juan and asked if she was free for a drink. She was glad and invited me over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Becky was around, and the three of us drank, made jokes, and just like that, most of my worries were forgotten. I&#39;d really needed the distraction.</p>
