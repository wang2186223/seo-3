                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated for a moment, trying to think of the best way to handle his mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been calling for fuck knows how long! You didn&#39;t return any of my calls! I was fucking worried,and this whole time,you were with him?! Are you for real?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the car behind me. Alpha Zarek was still there. His glass wasn&#39;t tainted, so we could see him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! It&#39;s-It&#39;s not what you think. I tried to call back but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you, Lyric? Do you really have no self-control? How can you be this loose?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck me deep in the heart that my jaw dropped to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael shifted uncomfortably and turned to the guards with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34;he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as they walked off, leaving me with the unreasonable side of Jaris. &#34;How can you even say that?&#34; I scoffed. &#34;I don&#39;t sleep around, Alpha Jaris! So, you have no right to use those words on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that we were alone, I felt that I could finally raise my voice. Although it came more from pain than frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, spare me!&#34; He scoffed. &#34;You don&#39;t even know what you do. You&#39;re that desperate for sex, aren&#39;t you?It isn&#39;t just me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I feared I&#39;d have a heart failure. What was he talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded like I was a whore. A shameless whore he hated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t...&#34; | shook my head, tears pouring down. &#34;I don&#39;t understand. How can you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before we signed this agreement, I told you how important my image is,&#34; He stepped toward me,anger emanating from his pore. &#34;I told you l didn&#39;t give a fuck how loose you were. But I made you understand I didn&#39;t want you fucking around while we were together. All you have to do is wait, Lyric! If you&#39;re so desperate for men, you fucking wait until we&#39;re done!Then,I won&#39;t stop you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t even know what happened!&#34; I yelled at him &#34;How can you just lay these stupid accusations against me? What is wrong with you?!&#34; | didn&#39;t mind the fact that I was using a curse word on him. I was so pissed and hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? Why don&#39;t you go back to the car with him? I&#39;m sure you&#39;re dying to spend the night with him, huh? Go back, Lyric! You probably have more men you want to sleep with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed to stop. My heart. The air. Time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I couldn&#39;t even see Jaris in front of me as everything wvent blank. I thought I was going to pass out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But seconds later, everything returned to normal. I could see Jaris again. I could breathe again. But my heart wasn&#39;t the same. It wasn&#39;t beating right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jaris now and could only see a stranger.Since I met him, he had said a lot of hurtful things to me; things that made me cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of them had been like this. None of them had tortured me this much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as painful as dying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| dragged my eyes from his face to the ground beneath his feet. So many retorts rested on my tongue. But | couldn&#39;t find the strength to push them out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re unbelievable.&#34; It was all I could manage to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to leave but stopped dead in my tracks. No. I couldn&#39;t leave like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned back to him. He was still staring at me, his eyes as hot as mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know where you get these speculations from,and I don&#39;t even care. Not anymore. But know this,Jaris,&#34; Yeah, I called him by his name. To hell with the respect. &#34;My whole life, I have only ever slept with one man, and it&#39;s the worst mistake of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my hatred burn through as I turned and walked away, going past Zarek&#39;s car. I heard him come out of the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t turn. I was done with everyone. I was done with everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a bitter taste on my tongue, and a heavy ache in my heart. For the first time, she called me by my name while she was conscious. But it rolled off her tongue with deep hatred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rage. Hatred. Confliction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt it all at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For hours, the boys and I had been looking for her.I was worried that something bad might have happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, it seemed she was with Zarek alI along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew how she sounded. She was clearly trying to deny it. But I knew better. She slept with him before we got mated. Who was to say she hadn&#39;t been doing the same after then?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A car stopped by the road to drop off one of our Pack members. I angrily watched as she got inside herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For weeks, we&#39;ve been on an &#39;okay&#39; level. It was painful to know I wasn&#39;t exclusive to her body. That after everything we shared, she still went running to her side lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek stormed toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,now that I thought of it, the asshole was still here.He was insane if he thought he&#39;d be getting out of here unhurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to hurt him. So so bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is wrong with you, Jaris?!&#34; He growled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw red as I looked at him. I balled mny hands into fists, thinking of the best way to hurt him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you be so unreasonable? Do you even know what happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I punched him before he could say anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, fuck the asshole. It was all his fault. If he hadn&#39;t set up that stupid bet. If he hadn&#39;t tempted Lyric to fall for him, none of these would&#39;ve happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,you need to calm the fuck down,&#34; he growled,not even touching the part of his face I&#39;d punched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was trying so hard to think straight, but it was extremely difficult with the asshole in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll kill you, Zarek,&#34; I hissed. &#34;I promise you,if you don&#39;t get away from me right now-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I&#39;d rather pick grass than be anywhere near you But you&#39;re being unfair to Lyric. She didn&#39;t deserve what you just did!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, really?&#34; I stepped toward him. &#34;You think you&#39;re in any position to say that considering what you&#39;ve done?&#34; &#34;Exactly! What &#39;l&#39;ve&#39; done. Not what &#39;she&#39; did.&#34; He spoke like I was missing something. But I knew his words could only be a lie. He was an asshole who was going to die by my hands someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him from head to toe, wishing there were no witnesses to see me kill him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away from here,&#34; I spat, just before | turned around to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric and I never had sex!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words froze me.</p>
