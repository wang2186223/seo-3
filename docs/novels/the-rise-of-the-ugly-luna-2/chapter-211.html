                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were about to get messy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Here I was, baking some cookies for the kids just before the news of Alpha Miguel&#39;s death reached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was very furious and set to fly out to the Alpha&#39;s pack. Last night, he&#39;d given me a highlight of what the problem was. Now, with the high-ranking Alpha dead, it wasn&#39;t looking good, especially.with Jaxen being the suspect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I intended to go with Jaris and decided to quickly serve the cookies to the kids before getting ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, their problematic mother wasn&#39;t in when I entered, only their nannies. Jaris told me he&#39;d managed to speak with the kids last night and was even the one that suggested giving something to them this morning. They were getting ready for school and all stopped to look at me when l entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; I beamed, ignoring how hurt I was from the fact that they didn&#39;t come to hug me like they normally would. &#34;I trust your nights were good?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t say anything, but they also didn&#39;t try to push me off either, which was a very good sign.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I made your favorite cookies. Trust you&#39;ll enjoy taking it to school. But I must warn you, the sugar is very minimal. Just let me know if you&#39;ll prefer more sugar next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the tray on their table. They still didn&#39;t say a word to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shrugging,I turned around to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, aunt Lyric,&#34; I heard that small familiar voice just as my hand wrapped around the knob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in my tracks, turned around and released a bright smile at Xylon. &#34;You&#39;re welcome, honey.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room feeling like I was floating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was so angry I was so scared of talking to him.So,I slept off the entire flight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gentle tap woke me when we reached our destination.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to stay back &#39;cause this might be stressful. You just don&#39;t listen,&#34; he scolded lightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone needed to be here to stop you from ripping some heads off,&#34; I yawned sleepily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alighting the plane, I perceived the smell of something strong-like chicken soup. It was so hard to resist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think we need to check out the restaurant,&#34; I turned to Jaris with puppy eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We might be here for something gravely important,but there was no way I was leaving this airport without having a taste of that soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t have time for this,&#34; he tried to object.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, you could just leave me behind and I&#39;ll catch up with you. But make no mistake, I&#39;m not getting out of here without tasting that soup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Jaris couldn&#39;t abandon me. He followed me to the kitchen where we grabbed the soup before proceeding to our location.I ate in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we reached the late Alpha&#39;s Pack, I was done eating and in my sober mood. The entire Pack was gloomy and filled with so much sadness.Nothing like I&#39;d seen before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was enough to make me regret eating the soup l just had, because now | felt like throwing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I showed Lyric a place to sit and wait for me while myself and my men went in to see the body. Bodies, actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel and nine other of his men had been killed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight filled me with fresh rage and the need to rip someone&#39;s head off. Miguel hadn&#39;t just been killed; he&#39;d been brutalized. Same with his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the report I got, after returning from the meeting last night, he stopped by his favorite bar to get some drinks. It was on his way home the attack occurred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miguel was a strong man from a strong Pack. For them to have been overpowered, their attackers must&#39;ve come in large numbers. Unfortunately,there were no survivors or witnesses. So, we didn&#39;t even know who was responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how convenient that he ended up dead during this dispute with the company?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d summoned the other Alphas to the Pack. Some of them were already there before | arrived, while some arrived after me. I stayed on the lookout for Jaxen, and the moment he showed up, I went to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, My-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?&#34; | interrupted him, forcing him to grasp the gravity of the moment. Someone else might actually have to die here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the bodies behind me, then back at me. &#34;Please, King Jaris, I hope you&#39;re not trying to insinuate that I had something to do with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you tell me, Jaxen? Shortly after the meeting, he ends up dead. Do you, perhaps, have a friend that would help kill him for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t kill him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Easy for you to say when there are no witnesses.However,with him gone, there&#39;s no one to drag the company with you. How very convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Ja-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough talking!&#34; A defeaning silence filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, I needed someone to pay for this. I wished there was enough evidence so I could hold someone accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated people getting away with murder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Henceforth, Jaxen,&#34; I stepped closer to him. &#34;Your company-Aura House-will be shut down until further notice.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?! You can&#39;t do that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. &#34;Why don&#39;t you try to stop me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Jaris, please! Why don&#39;t we bury the dead and stop trying to accustom blame?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck a wrong nerve, making me want to hit him in the groin. Oh, the son of a bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be lucky I&#39;m not completely shutting the place down. For now, these deaths will be investigated. And if you&#39;re found guilty, Jaxen, the company will be the least of your worries.&#34; I walked out, going to meet Miguel&#39;sfamily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I had to spend some time with the bereaved family and left in the evening. But his mood was still a mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I become King and suddenly, a lot of bad things are happening,&#34; he grumped on the way home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I really hoped my secret being exposed wasn&#39;t one of the &#39;bad things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached home, I followed him to his room,helped him take off his shirt and led him to sit on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you take a deep breath for me?&#34; | cooed as I began massaging his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, showing me how much he needed that touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled and continued with the process for a while until he was calm enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to shower with me?&#34;|asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, that won&#39;t come easily. I need to be sure you won&#39;t try to attack me or something in the bathroom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t be silly, Lyric. I could be burning the entire world and you can be sure I won&#39;t lay a single hand on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement fluttered through me like a thousand tiny wings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We showered together, and had sex too-of course.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to go to my room to get a sleeping outfit, then return to his for a sleepover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was opening my door when I heard footsteps behind me. Just as I turned, something hard connected with my face. A stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision turned dark as a pained grunt escaped me, followed by an explosion in my head. The hit came again-twice-until I was forced to my knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop!&#34; I cried out, holding my hand out to Luna Isolde who was holding the stick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock and pain was too much for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood dropped from my head to my face, and the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to scream but my throat was clogged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the collar of my shirt, she dragged me into the room and closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve left when I warned you to. Did you really think I&#39;d stand by and watch him fall for a Siphon?&#34; She scoffed. &#34;Your kind will always be forbidden in our land. Since he doesn&#39;t want to see the truth, I&#39;ll help him get rid of that curse in your womb!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No... please!&#34; I weakly held my hand up, the other hand flying to my belly in fear. &#34;Help!&#34; I thought I could scream, but it was futile and sounded like a joke.Nobody could hear me in this situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a struggle staying awake when all I saw was red and it felt as though I was drowning. I feared I&#39;d truly die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kicked me in the chest, making me lie on my back. My hand still wrapped protectively around my tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I whimpered.&#34;My baby...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she didn&#39;t listen. She hit me on the tummy with the stick, repeatedly, ignoring my cry of pain. Until the whole thing was too much and I passed out.</p>
