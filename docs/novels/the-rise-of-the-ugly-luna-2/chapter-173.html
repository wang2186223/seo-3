                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cut ran over my heart, going deep and making me bleed profusely. His hand dropped from my hair while I sat up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-We&#39;ve talked about this already. Remember I told you I&#39;d be there every step of the way and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For how long will you need to be there?&#34; It was hard to miss the echo of anguish in his tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released a deep breath, as if bracing himself to say something. &#34;Just an hour ago, I nearly killed one of our own. Again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She brought my meal, and the whole time, I couldn&#39;t stop fantasizing about how good her blood would be on my tongue. I could hear the rush, the pulse,everything. And trust me, Lyric; I was this close to grabbing her and slitting her wrist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran a hand through his hair. &#34;I couldn&#39;t even spend a lot of time with my kids because I was scared l&#39;d hurt them. What if they get to be with me one day and I start fantasizing about feeding on them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;ll never happen. You love Xylon and Xyla too much to let that happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I do love them with every fiber of my being,but how can l even trust myself?&#34; He shook his head.&#34;The people do not deserve a monster like me to be King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled myself closer until I could place my mass on his shoulders. &#34;This is what Caden wants. Are you really going to give him the satisfaction of winning?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;It isn&#39;t about winning anymore,Lyric. It&#39;s about keeping the people safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And they will be safe. You beat this before,remember? What makes you think you won&#39;t do it in a shorter time this year?&#34; I slid my hands down from his shoulders to hold his hands. &#34;All you have to do is win the trial while we continue working on the urges.Believe me,you can do this. Remember you showed great improvement over the week.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped on our hands intertwined. &#34;WVhen we&#39;re together, do you ever feel the urge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Then, I&#39;ll always be with you.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s not that easy.&#34; He withdrew his hand from mine.&#34;When I&#39;m with people, I always have problems concentrating. All I can hear and smell is the rush of their blood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, think of me when you&#39;re with people.&#34; I reached for his hand again. &#34;Just... imagine me to be them. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze held mine for some seconds, so curious and intent. &#34;What exactly should I think about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. &#34;I don&#39;t know, my smiles? Voice?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else?&#34; There was a hint of amusement in his eyes, yet he didn&#39;t break a smile. Neither did his eyes leave mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... The day we met? No, you&#39;d been pretty arrogant that day. That isn&#39;t a good memory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about the day you realized I was beautiful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked a brow, like my statement was funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to release his hands and realized he was now the one holding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How about this?&#34; He asked softly. I didn&#39;t know what he meant and kept staring into his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I saw it. His head descending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could&#39;ve looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcefully left the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, my whole world seemed to still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head wouldn&#39;t move an inch. Until his lips descended on mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no explaining the current surged through my veins, igniting every nerve with uncontained intensity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every heartbeat vanished, surrendering completely as his lips claimed mine with fervor, his hands still holding mine captive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this wasn&#39;t the first time Jaris was kissing me in the past one week. Yet, everything about this particular kiss screamed different. I got alarms going off in my head, warning me to stop this while I can.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because this-this very kiss was the kind that led to mistakes and regrets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, I did anything but try to stop the kiss. I kissed him back, sucking on his tongue when he darted it out to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat was already pooling in my lower belly, making it difficult to sit still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he pulled apart, breaking the contact between our lips, I wanted to scream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips were wet and tempting to take hold of again.And when he took his bottom lip into his mouth, his eyes on mine, it was all I could do not to beg him to kiss me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think this memory would be more effective,&#34; With a voice smoother than silk, he sent shivers down my spine,his fingers stirring a symphony of shivers on my skin. &#34;Would you mind creating it with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he hear it? The way my heart thumped like it was in danger? My lips parted, but no words came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d wanted this for months now. Yet, I couldn&#39;t bring myself to admit it in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you say, Lyric?&#34; I melted completely when he brought his hand to my lower lip, tugging it between his thumb and index finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes closed on their own, the emotions too much to keep in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open your eyes,&#34; he whispered. I did without hesitation. &#34;And tell me what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved his hand from my lips to my hair,caressing my edges. &#34;Because I really, really,&#34; the hand slowly moved to my jaw. &#34;really want to fuck you,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next breath that left me was noticeably shaky. My thighs clenched as vivid memories of what it&#39;d be like having sex with Jaris Dreadmoor filled my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wouldn&#39;t be just a dream. This time, I&#39;d be able to feel him, touch him. It&#39;d be overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me you want it,&#34; his forehead pressed against mine.&#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the last word he needed to get me to melt completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want it,&#34; I answered breathlessly.</p>
