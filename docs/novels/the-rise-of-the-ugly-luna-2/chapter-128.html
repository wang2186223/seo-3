                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was worried about not seeing Jaris&#39; neck,Maddy kept nagging about how much she hated Jaris and, surprisingly, Nerion. I had to struggle to remain focused on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t even try to go after me or anything!Instead, he sided with that monster and asked me to shut up!&#34; She fumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Kael was there as well. Why are you only angry at Nerion?&#34; | was curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That moody grouch and I had nothing in common!Nerion was my friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed at her description of Kael. Well, that was what he looked like in the eyes of people until you actually got to know him. &#34;He was my bestfriend.&#34; There was a small crack in her voice that made me understand she was really hurt. &#34;Yet, he did nothing when my brother sent me away to an asylum. For five years, he stayed with Jaris and even became his head of security! He didn&#39;t come to visit me. He didn&#39;t care about me! And now, he simply asked me to shut up and get out.Because I went against the monster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at her and was shocked to see a tear on her cheek.What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sniffled and carefully flicked the tear off, not wanting to ruin her makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know someone as hot-headed as her was capable of crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Maddy. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reason he didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s no reason,&#34; she spat, her mean attitude back on. &#34;He simply didn&#39;t care about me. And nowl don&#39;t anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence filled the car for a little while before I broke it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You um... mentioned something about Jaris killing someone before. Like a lover. Were you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She folded her arms and looked away, out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d hinted at two things today that kept me on edge.Why won&#39;t she say anymore?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anything to say to you, Lyric.&#34; Her voice was clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not in my place to confess my brother&#39;s sins.&#34;She threw a heated glare at me before returning her eyes to the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed, shaking my head. She was actually still protecting the brother she claimed she hated. The rest of the drive went on in silence; one l appreciated anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we reached the gift store, Maddy was completely out of her teary mood and excited to make selections.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The store was quite large with so many items, it was hard to make a choice. Maddy was so excited to shop she didn&#39;t notice the men ogling at her. Aside her dressing &#39;sexy&#39;, she was actually a very pretty girl. Had this cute innocent face that every man would want to claim for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And sometimes, she could really act innocent; likea virgin child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, for instance, she was so happy picking out items she didn&#39;t even notice the attention she garnered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, I left her to feed her eyes while I made a call. It was Elder Mathias, and this time, fortunately,he answered.  Goodness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello? Good morning, Mr. Mathias.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s this?&#34; He was grumpy as hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s... I&#39;m Lyric. I just wanted to ask if your wife, Mrs.Penelope was around. I&#39;ve been trying to reach her but-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about?&#34; He cut me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s kind of personal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she isn&#39;t home. She went on a trip. If you want to speak with her,you call her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say anymore, he hung up on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled my hair in frustration, not knowing what else to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, Penelope was on a trip? She was obviously fine while I&#39;d been worried to death trying to reach her?Wasn&#39;t it obvious I was being ignored on purpose?She was starting to make the whole thing look suspicious. I cursed under my breath as I fixed the phone into my back pocket while turning around to return to Maddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released a startled gasp when I came face to face with a young lady I&#39;d almost bumped into.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry,&#34; she smiled at me, though it was chilling.&#34;Didn&#39;t mean to scare you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting over the shock, I took in her features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was quite tall with long slender legs and a skinny body. Although, she was skinny, she looked very strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had tattoos covering her arms and the most part of her neck, extending downward and getting lost into the T-shirt she had on. I had a feeling there would be more tattoos beneath her shirt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coupled with the icy look in her eyes,she looked like someone very dangerous. Not the kind of person I&#39;d want to be associated with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Getting gifts for someone?&#34; She tilted her head toward Maddy. She must&#39;ve seen us come in together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; I answered and walked past her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite pretty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped walking and turned around to face her again. She was giving me that smile again-that cold one that sent unease down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I had a feeling she was someone that didn&#39;t smile a lot, and right now, she was giving me her best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have a name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed.Who wouldn&#39;t?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I have to go back.&#34; I pointed in Maddy&#39;s direction before turning around again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine if you don&#39;t wanna talk to me. I just need one more thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Now I was getting tired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spun around in her direction to answer her for the last time. She pulled out a folded paper from the back pocket of her jean pants. I watched with curious eyes as she unrolled it, and the moment I saw what it was, oxygen stopped flowing to my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen this woman by any chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely heard her above the roaring in my ears. Andl barely heard the roaring in my ears above the thundering of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped beating, blood stopped pumping,and I went completely still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this what it felt like to go into a state of shock?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the picture for what felt like an eternity, yet found it hard to accept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was staring at myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My old self.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scarred me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My terrified eyes flicked back to the woman. The realization settled on me like a rock hitting my brain.</p>
