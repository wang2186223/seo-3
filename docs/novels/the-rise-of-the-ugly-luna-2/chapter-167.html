                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed to the door and opened without knocking.I barged into the room, my eyes darting around.I gasped when I saw the sight in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a woman on her knees, her back to me. But it wasn&#39;t the sight that bothered me. It was the man in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was lying on his side, his hands and legs chained.He was shirtless with black pants on. Pure horror filled me at how sweaty and sick he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman sprang to her feet, eyes wide in shock as she stared at me with a bowl of something in her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; I threw at her first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind? You barged in here and think you&#39;re the one who gets to ask the questions?Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my eyes round the room. On the table were so many herbs, portions and things I hadn&#39;t seen before.Was she a healer? But Maddy never made mention of Jaris being with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the lady again. Long orange-dyed hair with large green eyes. She was pretty but looked really mean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her and tried going to Jaris, but she held my hand before I could reach him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said who the hell are you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m Lyric-his mate!&#34; I wrenched my hand free and continued to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was heartbreaking. His eyes were closed like he was unconscious, but his breathing was too hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you know he was here?&#34; The girl asked behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t respond as I touched Jaris&#39; forehead with my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the...&#34; I quickly pulled my hand away.He was burning up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What have you been doing to him?&#34;|asked without looking at the lady as I touched his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think? I&#39;m a healer and he called me here to help him.&#34; And you&#39;d been calling him &#39;baby&#39;? I wanted to snap but held back the question. That wasn&#39;t the important thing for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scurried to my feet and went to the table to get a bowl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; Ms. Healer asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s burning up. That obviously needs to be regulated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed into the kitchen and filled the bowl with water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think I&#39;ve been trying to do this whole time?&#34; Ms. Healer asked as soon as I returned to the room. &#34;I am his healer. I know better than you do. So,step aside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am his mate and a doctor!&#34; I snapped at her before grabbing a napkin and dropping to my knees before Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t understand what her relationship was with Jaris yet, but the fact that she&#39;d spent the night with him and had to see him shirtless this whole time filled me with a certain kind of rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dipping the napkin into the water and wringing it, l used it to wipe his body. The girl was watching like a hawk, so I couldn&#39;t start Siphoning him just yet. But the moments my hands touched him, I felt him getting better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, Alpha Jaris came here for a reason-to be alone. If I were you, I&#39;d leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;I didn&#39;t drive all the way here to leave him alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling you; he&#39;ll be fine with me. I was the one that took care of him when it happened yearsago.Why do you think he called me this time around again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I turned slightly to look at her. &#34;So, it was you.Took you a whole year to help him get better. I&#39;m afraid we don&#39;t have the luxury of time right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris suddenly jerked, startling me. I fell back on my butts and even made the water from the bowl spill a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He released a low groan, pulling at his chains which were somehow connected to the roof to ensure he didn&#39;t break out of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were still closed, making me understand whatever he was passing through was only in his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get away from there!&#34; The healer rushed forward and pushed me back, taking my spot. She had something in her hand and applied it all over his chest. &#34;Wh-What&#39;s that?&#34; I inquired. But she didn&#39;t give me an answer. But I noticed Jaris became calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up and glared at me. &#34;I told you to leave him alone. This is my job where I know best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked away, returning to her table of herbs.I stood up slowly, grabbing my own bowl and napkin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I was helping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The healer turned to me, one hand on her hip.&#34;If |were you, l&#39;d get out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you&#39;re not me. So stop wishing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was done with her trying to get me to leave like she was the only one permitted to be around Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went out of the cabin, needing a breath of fresh air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I felt calmer, I put a call through to Jace to know how it was going with Penelope&#39;s sister. He didn&#39;t talk to me last night after his argument with Kael. And even this morning, he just left without letting me know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to be angry at himself and everyone around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, how&#39;s it going?&#34; I asked when he picked up. &#34;I don&#39;t even know. But there&#39;s someone else staying with her. I&#39;m suspecting it might be Penelope.She just won&#39;t open up to me,&#34; Jace responded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, if you have to break through into that house,you do that. I don&#39;t even care. If Penelope is in there -11</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. She keeps insisting that she doesn&#39;t know where her sister is. But she mentioned something that gave her away. She said even if I were to see Penelope, she wouldn&#39;t be able to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned. &#34;What did she mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wish I knew. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m still looking...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became distracted when I heard the healer say something from inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re awake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, I have to go. I&#39;ll call you back.&#34; I ended the call,running back into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Healer was kneeling in front of Jaris, holding a glass of water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was awake. He was lying on his back now with his hands chained. But he was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should drink this,&#34; Ms. Healer held the glass to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted his head slightly with the lady&#39;s hand going under his head to support him. He was taking small gulps from the glass when his eyes finally landed on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew back his head in aninstant, his brows furrowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; There was a rough edge to his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Alpha.&#34; I went forward to meet him, dropping to a crouch just beside the Healer. &#34;How&#39;re you feeling?A-Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to touch his face, but he pulled his head back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is she real?&#34; He asked the healer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he also have illusions?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The healer nodded. Though, she looked like she&#39;d rather lie to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; Jaris&#39; tone was wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I was worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did Maddy tell you about this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I didn&#39;t say anything, he groaned and hit his head on the floor. &#34;Lyric, I need you to leave. You shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each passing second, my throat was getting tighter to release words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something broke within me at the sight of the man before me. He didn&#39;t need to say it to let me know he was in pain. Seeing him like this...it was a tortuous sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; The words slipped out, my voice breaking. &#34;We shouldn&#39;t have gone to the diner.Maybe then, Caden wouldn&#39;t have done whatever he did to make you like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot liquid touched my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop being silly,&#34; he hissed. &#34;I do not have the time for this right now. I just need you to leave, Lyric. It&#39;s about to get ugly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body wracking with sobs, I shook my head.&#34;1&#34;not leaving you. Not like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I don&#39;t care!&#34; I wiped my cheek. &#34;I&#39;m staying here with you. I&#39;ll help you get better.I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Healer huffed. &#34;I&#39;m the only one that can help him get better.&#34; &#34;Ericka, I need you to get her out of here. You know why.&#34; His voice was growing weaker, his lids heavier.He looked like he&#39;d be slipping into unconsciousness anytime soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving!&#34; I glared hard at the healer-Ericka.&#34;I promise you, if you try to touch me, you won&#39;t like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking back at Jaris, I discovered he&#39;d already passed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha. Alpha Jaris.&#34; I gently shook his hand. But there was no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears poured more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ericka tried to convince me to leave, but I didn&#39;t listen to her and only went out of the house to clear my head.</p>
