                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went closer, sat on the edge of the bed and brought my hand to her hair, gently removing some strands from her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to stare at her as all I could see was her in pain. Her tortured cry was very much clear in my head;how she bagged the asshole to stop hurting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,Lyric. I always thought my kids were my weaknesses. I thought they&#39;d be the only ones to make me lose my mind at the prospect of them being hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Lyric...she did stranger things to me. Only the gods knew how much I fought to hold onto sanity when l heard her screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling myself away, I went into the bathroom for a cold shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was buttoning up the final clasp on my pajamas when I heard a small exhale behind me. I turned with the speed of a whirlwind and felt a crushing relief when I found Lyric&#39;s eyes open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I went to her. &#34;How&#39;s it? How&#39;re you feeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained still, hereyes taking the room in. They took longer to get to me, but when they finally did, the relief in them was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris?&#34; Her voice was small.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She called the name like she couldn&#39;t believe she was home and safe. She must&#39;ve thought she was stil somehow trapped with Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re home. You&#39;re fine now.&#34; I sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I noticed she wanted to sit up, I stood up to assist her. She looked around the room again before pulling the bedcover closer to her chest. The doctors got rid of her torn outfit and slipped a patient gown on her. So, she was more covered than she was when we found her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand moved around her face, and it hurt me to know she was feeling the bruises. Her left eye was still swollen that I wondered if she could see with it. Her right eye wasn&#39;t swollen but had a bruise beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to seea spot that didn&#39;t have a cut on her body. Her neck, her hands, legs. Everywhere. The son of a bitch hurt her real good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need me to get the doctors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head, her eyes not meeting mine anymore. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I lowered my head, rethinking my next words. Apologies weren&#39;t something I did often, but tonight, my high values didn&#39;t matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>sorry,&#34; I told her honestly. If it wasn&#39;t for me, she wouldn&#39;t have been taken. &#34;Sorry you had to go through this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brought her knees to her chest, huddling herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&#34; her voice was so small I almost didn&#39;t hear her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was. Caden and I were two demons at each other&#39;s necks, and unfortunately, she got caught up in the middle.Hopefully, this will be the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to ask you a question,&#34; my tone turned serious. &#34;Your clothes were torn when we found you. Did he...&#34; I glanced at her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man like me who had never had issues saying what he wanted, this was quite difficult to let out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Caden did touch her-which I knew he was capable of-I wouldn&#39;t know what to do with myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew Lyric saying no to something would feel so good until I watched her shake her head at my question. &#34;He didn&#39;t,&#34; she added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;He-He just... tortured me.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the tremor in her voice. It was enough to tell me to drop the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The doctors said you needed to eat as soon as you&#39;re awake.&#34; I stood up to grab my phone from the table.&#34;So, I&#39;ll get you something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed a call to the kitchen and requested a meal for her. Something I knew she&#39;d like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re the kids?&#34; She asked as soon as I dropped the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she for real? She was worried about the kids in this state?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fine.&#34; I hadn&#39;t even checked on them since I returned, too focused on Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked sad as she lowered her gaze. &#34;Their party was ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t your fault.&#34; I poured some water into a glass cup. &#34;They&#39;ve actually identified the body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long silence, so long I had to look behind me to be sure she was still there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T-They have?&#34; She stuttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;She&#39;s an Executioner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drank from the cup, refilled and went to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-How are they sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All Executioners have a specific tattoo ontheir backs. It is one way to identify them.&#34; I held the glass to her.&#34;Drink up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With slight hesitation, she took the glass and drank a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,any idea why an Executioner would be at the kids&#39; party?&#34; I shrugged. &#34;The Executioners only hunt. So, it&#39;s possible she was hunting someone. Maybe one of the guests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And... you think this guest must have killed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the only explanation we have. Although...the Executioners are quite strong. Killing them is never an easy task,&#34; I added thoughtfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished the water, I took the glass from her. I was on my way back to the table when her words halted me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her loud gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He asked me to deliver a message to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. I continued my walk to the table, dropped the glass and turned slowly to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What message?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed really nervous, her eyes darting to the floor. &#34;He gave me an address; said he wants both of you to meet there tomorrow. Alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing I&#39;d dropped the glass already. Otherwise, there was no doubt I&#39;d have hauled it against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole. What did he think he was doing getting Lyric to deliver the message to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He...he said...&#34; She hesitated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say, Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That he&#39;d hurt the kids next if you don&#39;t show up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood turned to flames. Right now, I&#39;d do anything to have Caden in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to grip the table, doing my best to keep my composure. I couldn&#39;t lose it now in front of Lyric. She didn&#39;t need this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a full minute to be able to turn back around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on.&#34; I cocked my head at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed confused and didn&#39;t make a move. So I went closer, offering her my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-Where are we going?&#34; Her eyes held a little bit of panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, I really hoped she wasn&#39;t going to be traumatized by what happened and think everyone was out to hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me. Just come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few seconds, she finally placed her hand in mine and I helped her off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked.weird seeing her in this patient dress. It made her look smaller and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed she wasn&#39;t just avoiding my gaze. She was trying to prevent me from looking at her as much as she could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she ashamed of her face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her hand tightly in mine, I led her toward the bathroom. She stopped walking when we got to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-Why are we going in there?&#34;</p>
