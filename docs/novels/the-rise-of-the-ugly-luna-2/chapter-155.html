                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I finished going through the interior, Kael had arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; He kept a straight face as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I love it! Is the Alpha in?&#34; | wouldn&#39;t mind going over to his room to thank him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. He stepped out already.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the car key dearly to my chest. &#34;Thank you so much. I&#39;ll definitely reach out to him. I love this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded before drifting his attention to Jace who had been quiet since he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi,Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey.How you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael shrugged, &#34;Cool, I guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a certain sadness in Kael&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... I guess I&#39;ll get going.&#34; I cut in and tried going into my old car, but Jace pulled me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope. I&#39;m driving my new car.&#34; He took the key from me and settled in the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a couple of minutes, we were driving out the gates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should&#39;ve taken the ribbons off at least!&#34; I grumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nope.How then would everyone know it was a gift?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How are things with you and Kael?&#34; His demeanor changed. Why did he always get this way whenever I brought the Beta up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We cool. We um...spent the night together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened as amusement colored my cheeks. Jace glanced at me and expressed horror at the thought he knew must be going through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Not what you think. We didn&#39;t have sex. Is sex all you think about,Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?!&#34; | expressed disappointment.&#34;I mean, how can you two even spend the night together and not have sex?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He twisted his lips, making it obvious he was holding back from saying something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we talk about you? Why is Alpha Grumpy gifting you expensive cars? Have you also been spending your nights with him?&#34; He pulled a suspicious stare at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I hit his arm. &#34;He&#39;s just keeping his own part of the deal. And that reminds me, I need to call him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for my phone and placed the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t pick up, but before I could drop the phone, his call camne in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Lyric,&#34; he called me by the new name he preferred.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. &#34;Alpha Jaris. I trust your morning is going fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should.Yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez.I loved how deep and masculine he sounded on phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My morning was perfectly fine and got even better when I saw the car. It&#39;s good to know you are a man of your word. No wonder Darkspire is thriving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a pause from his end. It made me wonder-was he smiling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Delighted to know I have a fan,&#34; his response made me smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, Alpha Jaris. I love it. But I think you should&#39;ve gone for something smaller.&#34; I honestly didn&#39;t want to imagine how expensive this must have been. Although I knewv it wasn&#39;t a big deal for someone like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re worth it, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in astonishment, my heart rate seeming to slow down for some seconds. I didn&#39;t need to look in the rearview to know there must be color on my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was worth it. It was the first time those specific words were being said to me, and I couldn&#39;t begin to describe how wholesome they made me feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if you&#39;re feeling guilty, you could make it up to me, you know?&#34; His words brought me back to the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And...how would you suppose I do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could treat me to dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh. But it sounded fun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I could do that. What&#39;s your schedule like for the evening?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tight. But I could squeeze you in if you&#39;re up for it. Although, I must warn you-you have to be rich. I don&#39;t go to cheap diners, Ms. Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;I think I&#39;m rich enough. Count me in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.See you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended. Yet the warmth in my heart didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone has definitely been sleeping around,&#34; Jace said in a sing-song tone. &#34;Because tell me, what is all this sweetness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled, unable to defend myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time in my life, it felt like I was in a normal relationship. Although, I knew it was only a fantasy as 1 was merely his mate. But I liked whatever was going on between Jaris and I. And maybe someday, just someday,we could be more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Don&#39;t be ridiculous, Lyric. It&#39;s only for a year,&#39; that snacky voice tried to ruin my joy but I didn&#39;t let it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was going to be a special one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Any news on Penelope?&#34; | asked a while later, my demeanour changing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace shook his head no, and that was enough to ruin the small peace I&#39;d felt. Why wasn&#39;t she reachable? It&#39;s been two weeks already.Could she be dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past two weeks, I&#39;d been worried sick I didn&#39;t even consider resuming at TCH despite my suspension being over. It was Jace&#39;s idea to actually resume so I could occupy my mind with something else. Plus, he mentioned that it&#39;d be easier getting information if I was out here meeting people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We still :had Caden&#39;s problem. He gave Jaris a week. It&#39;s been two weeks and we were yet to hear from him.There had been no attacks from the Feeders either. It looked a little suspicious. But all we could do was hope he was really off our backs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally reached TCH and I went in without Jace. He said he had somewhere to be but asked me to call him as soon as I needed a ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking through the ground floor, I couldn&#39;t help feeling a little nervous. I could tell all eyes were on me despite how much I tried to ignore them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was seen as the clumsy doctor. The one who caused the death of four patients. If it wasn&#39;t for the encouraging words of the people around me, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d have had the confidence to come back here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath when I was alone in the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t do anything wrong, Lyric. You didn&#39;t kill those patients,&#34; I said to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped by Guinevere&#39;s office to let her know I was back. She seemed happy to have me back and even gave me some words of encouragement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked on a few other doctors and got my schedule for the day. In less than an hour, I was set to check on my first patient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I proceeded, I went to a particular doctor l&#39;d been eager to speak with. I knocked on the door and walked in when she ushered me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta Monroe looked all professional behind her desk, in her transparent glasses. She was holding some files but her brows furrowed when she saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; She adjusted in her seat. &#34;You&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips lifted in a smile. &#34;| am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,can I help you with something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please,&#34; I huffed, crossing my arms. &#34;If there&#39;s anyone that needs help between the both of us, it&#39;s you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said nothing, her expression hard to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, Marta, are you disappointed that I&#39;m back? I&#39;m sure you thought I&#39;d have my license revoked when you pulled that big plan of yours.&#34;①</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her temple, as if exhausted. &#34;Look, Lyric; if you came here to spit gibberish, I&#39;d suggest you use the door. I&#39;m very busy and don&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, you listen to me.&#34; I stepped forward. &#34;One of the reasons I was determined tocome back here despite how hard it was was because I wanted to get back at you. You fucking hurt me, Marta. Not just by getting me suspended, but by killing those innocent patients in my name.How could you be so evil?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill anyone!&#34; She snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I don&#39;t care. You can lie all you want, but know this Marta, I&#39;ll make you pay for what you did to those people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up, her eyes like shards of glass. &#34;Get out of my office. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 glared down at her, then took my eyes round the office. &#34;You don&#39;t have to insist. It smels like evil in here, anyway.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, if I were you, Lyric, I&#39;d be careful who l make threats to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped at the door, giving her an amused stare. &#34;You must be mistaken, &#39;cause I didn&#39;t threaten you. You see, I only gave you facts about what would happen soon. I, Lyric Harper, would gladly watch the day you fall from this stupid throne of yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glinted with rage, but her lips stretched in a wicked smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll see, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at her and walked out the door. Marta didn&#39;t know what was coming for her. She had no idea I had a perfect dish waiting to be served.</p>
