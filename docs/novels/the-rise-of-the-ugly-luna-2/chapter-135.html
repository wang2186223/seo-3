                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| realized I hadn&#39;t been mistaken when | spotted someone familiar fromn the crowd. It was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even now, she was staring at me, giving me that chilling look, letting me know she could see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was she doing here? How did she get an invite?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike the previous day, she was wearing a long pretty dress. The tattoos on her arms and neck made her look fierce in a dress that should&#39;ve made her look like a Princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress didn&#39;t even look fitting on her.She looked like she&#39;d be way better in jeans or whatever she wore at the mall yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke our contact, attempting to distract myself with something. But it wasn&#39;t possible. Not when l had a killer in front of me. A killer who was out to get me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But was it possible she knew who I was already? Was that the reason she was here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, trying and failing to calm the storm in my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to know if she was here for me. If she was, l was dead anyway. So, why don&#39;t l just risk it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was only one way to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing my purse, I walked out of the field, toward the guest building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was quiet since everyone was out there in the field. I walked down the hallway leading to the restroom, my heart quickening in my chest. I was taking a huge risk, but I didn&#39;t have much of a choice.It was the only way I could know if I was safe or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached the restroom and waited, my hands shaking around the vanity. My breath hitched when l heard calm footsteps. It kept getting closer. And closer. Until I could see her behind me through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes twinkled like frozen lakes as they pinned me with a stare, her hands crossed behind her back at the doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so lethal. It was unnerving to know this very woman and many more like her were after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard, but I forced myself to remain calm as l turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you here to use the restroom or you just following me around?&#34; | was proud at how even my voice came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t sound scared, but only I knew how much I was shaking inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answer didn&#39;t come immediately. She starved me with it, her cold gaze doing wicked things to my already terrified heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think there&#39;s a reason I should be following you around?&#34; She finally said, tilting her head to the side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You tell me. I saw you yesterday and today you&#39;re here. How did you get an invite?&#34; Because | was damn sure Jaris wouldn&#39;t invite an Executioner to his kids&#39; party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence between us. Then, she stepped into the room, making it all worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard, my hands gripping the vanity where my waist leaned against.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are a very pretty lady, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped two beats. She knew my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yesterday, I didn&#39;t approach you merely because wanted to ask you about the picture. It was because l was interested in you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interested?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed, not getting what she meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been a long time since I came across someone as beautiful as you,&#34; she explained. &#34;And the moment I saw you, I was curious to know how you&#39;d taste.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding rained on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was into girls. And...she had been into me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then, you wouldn&#39;t even talk to me. So,decided to ask you a different question. And while you gave me an answer...&#34; two more steps toward me.&#34;...you must have not known who I was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She held my gaze with a fervor that set my heart racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it was possible to retreat any further into the vanity I&#39;d have so. Because I didn&#39;t like the fact that she was coming too close to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because if you&#39;d known who I was...&#34; she was only inches away from me now Somehow, I couldn&#39;t stop staring into her dark eyes. &#34;...you&#39;d have known that my kind is capable of detecting when someone tells a lie.&#34; She narrowed her eyes, as if looking deeper into mine. &#34;It&#39;s as easy as readinga paper under sunlight.&#34; Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which is the reason I&#39;m here today. Because clearly,Lyric Harper,you know something about the girl in the picture.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure my heart was beating anymore. It didn&#39;t even feel like I was alive for a few seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to accept it. That I was doomed.I&#39;d finally met my nemesis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mask of confidence had long slipped from the moment she started walking toward me like a predator. My defenses were down. There was a thin line between me standing here being held captive by her eyes and running out the door for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who would help me? If they get to know who l was, they&#39;d gladly let the Executioner have my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&#34; I gulped hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She observed me for a moment, clearly seeing through my lies again. &#34;You&#39;re making a huge mistake lying to me, Lyric. You have no idea how dangerous this lady is. She&#39;s been on our radar for years now, and believe me,you don&#39;t want to know how desperate my colleagues and | are to get her.&#34; Sh took one more step closer. &#34;Obstacles will definitely be dealt with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t have anything to say to you!&#34; I rasped.&#34;don&#39;t know who you are and honestly don&#39;t care.Why don&#39;t you just stay away from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to leave but she stood in my way, her gaze growing colder. Her voice, when she spoke, was even icier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper,&#34; she tsked. &#34;Believe me when I say you wouldn&#39;t want my colleagues down here with you.The torture you&#39;d get from them just to uncover the truth would be inhuman. You have a pretty face; it&#39;d be quite a shame to see it ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I was making it easier for her to actually see I was lying. I was rattling from head to heels. Okay. Maybe I should shout for help or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All I have to do is give them a call,&#34; she continued,sending more dread down my spine. &#34;Tell them l&#39;ve got a clue. You&#39;d be amazed how soon they&#39;d get here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. So, she hadn&#39;t told any of her colleagues about me yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t make me feel better, though. I was still a trembling mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lyric,&#34; her voice took on a lighter tone as she closed up the remaining distance between us. Her hand reached out to grab some strands of my hair,and she had this loving gaze as she rolled the strands around her index finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;From how much you&#39;re shaking, I&#39;d bet you&#39;d be the fun type in bed. You know, I love it when my women are like this.&#34; Her lips lifted slightly, breaking into a cold smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this funny to her? She was having fun while I was dying inside?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl I&#39;m looking for,&#34; she withdrew her hand as she turned away, pacing the bathroom with her hands now behind her back. &#34;Her name is Marie Grimvale.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I struggled with another hoarse gulp, relieved that she wasn&#39;t looking at me. If I could slip my phone out of my purse or something...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t surprised that they thought that was my name. I got that job after I lost my kids and wanted a fresh start. So, I picked a new name. Now, I couldn&#39;t be more grateful | did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is what everyone calls her, but somehow,&#34; she stopped in front of the door, her back still to me. &#34;I have this burning instinct within me that tells me that was never her real name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shrugged. &#34;She didn&#39;t strike me like a Marie Grimvale kind of person. And what if...just what if,&#34;She turned partially to cock her head at me. &#34;She&#39;s gotten rid of her scar? You know, since we&#39;re looking for her.&#34;</p>
