                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The astonishment that jarred me was forceful. Her question felt like a betrayal to my emotions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why would you be asking about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon answered next. &#34;We&#39;ve just been worried. Have you seen her? Do you think she can visit?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it had been someone else and not the kids, only the Moon knew how I&#39;d have reacted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I straightened up. &#34;You don&#39;t need to ask her about her. We don&#39;t need her in our lives anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why!? We miss her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it, Xyla! Have you forgotten all the things she did? She killed your grandmother. She... She...&#34; My brows furrowed as I tried to search for something else. Oh, yes! &#34;She&#39;s currently with my brother, helping him against us. She left me even before...&#34; I paused, realizing there were certain things the kids didn&#39;t need to know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric had been nothing but a pain in my life. There was not a single happy memory about her. All she ever caused me was pain. How did I ever stand by her when she was first discovered to be a Siphon? Oh, damn me;I should&#39;ve handed her to the Executioners then. How was I so foolish?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never should&#39;ve gotten mated to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael opened the door slowly, peeping in. &#34;The cars are ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a ball of nerves deep in my belly; a ball that had been forming from the moment Caden and I left the house. Even in the car, I tried to beg him to leave me out of this meeting. I didn&#39;t want to meet Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the gods forbid Caden miss out on an opportunity to rub me in Jaris&#39; face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand holding my purse curled around it so tight as we walked towards the hall. I tried to mentally prepare myself for it. Jaris would be there, along with some of the Alphas I&#39;d known from him. What would his reaction if he sess me with Caden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although there was a part of me that&#39;s been eager to see him after all these while, but I was still so nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden reached for my hand just before we reached the door. I shot him a questioning look and quietly tried to free my hand from his, but of course, the son of a bitch wouldn&#39;t let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, he looked at me and smiled, letting me know he really loved this game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was nothing I could do as we finally walked through the door together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long table in the room, surrounded with chairs and filled with people. Yet I scoured my eyes around for just one person. And it didn&#39;t take me long to find him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart dropped into the darkest recess as our eyes locked, an invisible strain hanging between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris Dreadmoor.Right in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard not to notice someone like him, when he was the only man whose authority flowed around him like currents. When he had this unmistakeable charm that made people like me want to kneel at his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fleeting moment, the world didn&#39;t seem to exist anymore; only me and Jaris Dreadmoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something squeezed in my chest when he lowered his eyes to my hand being joined with Caden&#39;s. It was hard not to notice the hatred his eyes passed onto us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyes, guilt threatening to eat me up. By the moon, I shouldn&#39;t be here. Not at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen!&#34; Caden announced. &#34;I truly hope my lady and I didn&#39;t keep you waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hatred for him kept increasing. I stole another glance at Jaris as Caden led me to the table where I sat beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He&#39;d stopped staring at me, so I seized the opportunity and gave him a good stare. And it wasn&#39;t hard to do when he was sitting across from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but imagine: how has he been for the past three weeks? Has he been able to think clearly without me? I truly hoped siphoning our happy memories was enough to make him not be sad about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish he didn&#39;t have to look at me with so much hatred, but there was a part of me that felt assured that he wasn&#39;t hurting if he hated me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael was sitting next to him while Nerion stood behind him, observing the place. But I didn&#39;t miss the two of them stealing glances at me. Even some of the high-ranking Alphas looked at me, like they were shocked with my switch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairman Lyon cleared his throat. &#34;Um... Alphas,&#34; he addressed the low-ranking Alphas on the table. &#34;We&#39;re already gathered here like requested. Can we proceed with the meeting now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think I&#39;ll be doing more of the talking,&#34; Caden said. &#34;Afterall, this meeting was my idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we didn&#39;t get the invite from you,&#34; Jaris answered. &#34;I&#39;m sure you know I wouldn&#39;t be here if you&#39;d called for the meeting yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing him speak...it did unspeakable things to my body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden chuckled. &#34;Why don&#39;t we put the animosity behind us, brother and move on to the future? After this meeting, I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t be having any more issues.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris eased into his seat, interlocking his hands in front of him. &#34;And who exactly are you speaking up for here? Youdo not hold a position on this table, Caden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That,brother, is the purpose for this meeting. By the time we&#39;re done, you&#39;ll understand my position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can we move onto the point, please?&#34; Chairman Lyon cut in. He turned to Alpha Jaxen. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go ahead and tell us why this meeting was called for.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden tried to butt in. &#34;I think I&#39;ll do that-&#34; &#34;If Caden is the one speaking, I&#39;Il take my leave. He holds no relevance to me. So, I&#39;Il not sit here and let him address me on a meeting meant only for Alphas and the Council.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden should&#39;ve let it go. Instead, he went ahead to say something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would my Lady be suitable, then? Do you think she can address you?&#34;</p>
