                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the clothes I picked, corporate wears were among. And as I got ready to go to TCH,I wore one of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a grey knee-length dress, and I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever been more in love with the color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to TCH for my nightshift, my heart feeling lighter and warmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t new to this feeling. I was happy, and each time I was, there was always something to ruin my joy. This frightened me more than anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The warmth was quick to diminish when I ran into Marta on the ground floor. Right. What an awesome way to start my evening. Fortunately,she looked like she was leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked past each other without saying a word,but that was until I recalled what I had in mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Marta.&#34; I faked a smile as I turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on me in seconds,her face cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was told you have been performing a lot of wonders in the ward lately. First, it was Mr. Owen.Now it&#39;s Pete.&#34; I clicked by tongue. &#34;You&#39;re a genius.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss his uneasy she became. But it was Marta. She&#39;d combust before she let someone see her guilty she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you. I&#39;ve always been good at the game.It&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve lasted in TCH and became a head doctor.&#34; She shrugged defiantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my fake smile to stay on, even though all I wanted to do was tell her how much of a liar she was.Did she know I was the actual one behind the glory?Hopefully,not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That reminds me, Lyric,&#34; she stepped into my line of sight. &#34;I&#39;ve noticed your growing attachment to doctor Guinevere and would like to remind you that Guinevere is simply our supervisor. Over here, in our department, I&#39;m your head, Lyric. So, I&#39;d advise you start running things through me. You&#39;ll get your assignments through me, and if you have any questions, I&#39;m the one to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit the inside of my cheeks, forcing myself to stay calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you understand, Lyric?&#34; HHer gaze was piercing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh.I hated that bossy look in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t give her the satisfaction of replying to her stupid words. So, I walked out on her, feeling her burning glare on my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere must have been keeping an eye out for me, because not long after I got into my office,she arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked warmly for sometime before she told me about the patient demanding for me. It was enough to make my stomach drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to bid my time with Guinevere, but it was impossible when she was hell bent on taking me to the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a little assured that he hadn&#39;t told my secret yet.Otherwise, Guinevere&#39;s tone would have been different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was better I talk to him to know what he wanted and see how I could avoid him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond nervous as I walked into the room.The man was awake, sitting up and eating. There was a woman before him. Judging from her age, I guessed she was his wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s eyes lit up the second he saw me. &#34;It&#39;s her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Guinevere, not missing the surprise in her face. &#34;Did you treat him?&#34; My stomach knotted with nerves. I licked my lips as l shook my head. &#34;Let me talk to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man dropped his plate. And to my greatest relief,he dismissed Guinevere and the woman before him,saying he wanted to speak to me in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed his face lolked much better. On our way to the room, Guinevere mentioned he could be discharged the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the name?&#34; He asked, his eyes raking over me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, then realized he could easily get it torn Guinevere if he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. I&#39;m Pete.&#34; He sighed. &#34;I wanted to thank you for saving me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat ran dry. &#34;I think you&#39;re mistaken, sir. 1wasn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a Siphon.&#34; He cut me off, the confidence in his tone chilling. &#34;I saw your face.I know what you did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the door. We were alone. I could feel safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to believe this man would be a threat in any way. He&#39;d have exposed mne already,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know because, sixty years ago, my sister was one.&#34;His countenance fell, sadness marring lines on his forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes lit up, my brows scrunching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maelisa.&#34; His eyes were on the floor now,thoughtfully. &#34;She was my little sister. My bestfriend.But our parents, the moment they knew what she was,&#34; his face grew tighter. &#34;They handed her over themselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped, a gasp slipping through. &#34;They said she was a curse and meant more harm to them. They gladly took her to the King, and she was... she was...&#34; Ye shook his head, unable to get the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was executed. There were no two ways about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In our world, Siphons were the greatest form of taboo. We&#39;ve never been accepted. A weapon that could cause so much harm from mere touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought sent shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Before Maelisa was killed,&#34; he smiled. &#34;She used to play with her gift a lot. She&#39;d heal me each time I hurt myself or got sick. We didn&#39;t even know what she was yet. We only knew she could take ailment away by touching you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gift. I didn&#39;t miss that detail. He saw it as a gift, not a curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gloom returned in his eyes when he looked at me. &#34;What you carry is special, girl. But the world sees you as evil. You shouldn&#39;t be here. If Maelisa and I were grown enough to know better, we&#39;d have run for the heels when we had the chance. Too bad our own parents betrayed us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tight ball formed in my throat. It was a difficulty to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should run. Everyone keeps telling me. Yet, here l was, held back by something I couldn&#39;t explain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know there&#39;s been another Siphon in recent years,&#34;I murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been sixty years. The King and his Alphas made sure to bury the truth. They didn&#39;t want the public to know and panic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry about your sister.&#34; My eyes dropped to the floor. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask to be this. If I could,I&#39;d just want to be normal like everyone else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t really choose our fate, can we?&#34; He shrugged. &#34;You should take my advise, child. Run as fast as you can. These people, you might think you&#39;re helping them, but the moment they learn the truth, they&#39;d treat you worse than a slave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened. &#34;I was there. I remember what they did to Maelisa. Nobody deserves to go through that for being something they could not control.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cold liquid touched my cheek. I sniffled and realized I&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in danger here. My kind would never be accepted.I should leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Xylon... He was only getting better because of me. I didn&#39;t want to imagine what would happen if l abandon him.</p>
