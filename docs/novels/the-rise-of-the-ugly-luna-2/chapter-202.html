                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What do you want?&#34; I had to clear my throat to make sure it didn&#39;t come out raspy and give away the fact that I was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made me furrow my brows, until slowly,they made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still pointed it out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The girl at the hospital. The one that saved mne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hadn&#39;t realized the extent of what I did until Caden himself was thanking me for it. Gosh, I hated myself right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t save you. I was stupid and didn&#39;t even know who you were,&#34; I snapped. I&#39;d been beyond stupid. &#34;But you did save me.&#34; He sounded serious. &#34;I&#39;ve been looking for that same lady for years, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, keep looking!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This whole time, you knew but didn&#39;t say a word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched my brows, my frustration mounting as | so desperately wanted to let it out on someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We-We need to talk, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind? I&#39;m not seeing you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. I just need to...I need to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s important!&#34; He suddenly laughed. &#34;You&#39;re a Siphon, Lyric! Do you realize you&#39;re worth more than gold?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth suddenly hit me as strongly as it hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see me as an asset,&#34; I nodded like he could see me. &#34;No. No, Lyric. It&#39;s beyond that. Listen, I know the people are on your neck right now. Everyone thinks you&#39;re dangerous; and that&#39;s the difference between me and them. I can protect you. If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll leave those people and come to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I guess l&#39;ve never been smart, then,&#34; |chuckled, wiping a tear from my face. &#34;If I was, I&#39;d have never woken a monster like you, because you&#39;re the reason all of this happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I hadn&#39;t woken him up at the hospital, nobody would&#39;ve known I was a Siphon. The Executioners wouldn&#39;t have done looking for me. It was all his fault.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done talking to you. Please, don&#39;t ever reach out to me again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to say something but | cut him off by ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was curled up in bed when the door opened revealing Jaris. It suddenly felt like I&#39;d been alone for days and was just seeing a human for the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I jumped from the bed, ran to him and fell into his arms without thinking. It felt so good seeing someone that didn&#39;t hate me. Someone I was sure would have my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; his voice was soft, his hand caressing my back. &#34;Are y/ou alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He must find it strange that my first action was ggiving him a tight hug. If only he knew how much I needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a little longer to finally be able to let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,&#34; I breathed, staring into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except I was anything but fine. There was so much l wanted to talk to him about. The kids avoiding me,Caden calling me. But I was scared of starting an issue between him and the kids as I didn&#39;t want him forcing an opinion on them. And Caden.... Caden was</p>
                
                
                
                <p>just too stressful to talk about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Had anything to eat yet?&#34; He asked with a hand on my back as he led me to sit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. At Darkspire.&#34; Though I was still very hungry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He asked me more questions to make sure I was fine.Aside my own worry, I could see there were certain questions he was holding back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to know something, Lyric.&#34; His tone turned serious. He was seated next to me in bed, our legs touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I need you to be very honest with me.&#34; I didn&#39;t like it when Jaris used this tone with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his gaze, waiting for the bomb to drop. &#34;Six years ago, did you get pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock washed over me, causing my mouth to hang open as if frozen in time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, no! I pulled my hand away from his,quickly as if it burned. How did he find out?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I don&#39;t-&#34; | looked around nervously. &#34;Why are you just asking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;&#39;Cause a photo was found in your room.&#34; He took out his phone and showed me a picture. It was that of my scan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grew a degree wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion! I should&#39;ve suspected it when I found him leaving my room! Since I was packing up,I had the drawers unlocked and left the image carelessly. Well,I didn&#39;t expect someone to go in and check my drawer within that short period of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this yours, Lyric? I need you to be honest.&#34; The look in his eyes told me he had faith in me, and I&#39;d be a bitch to betray it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my eyes, letting him see the truth in my silence. A minute passed by with full silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly, unable to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, glancing up at the ceiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, why didn&#39;t you tell me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know who you were!&#34; My voice rose a notch.&#34;I mean, I thought I&#39;d been abandoned by a man who left me after seeing how I ugly I was. You wouldn&#39;t have been the first to do that to me, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My voice broke as I relived the trauma. All the days I was bullied and hated for my scar. How nobody wanted to be my friend or even help me. No guy wanted to touch me, and I was forced to remain a virgin even when I was mated to someone!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris reached for my hand again, his touch warm and soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were never ugly to me, Princess.&#34; The name warmed my heart, cracking some of the painful ice that had been gathering around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the first to ever call me that; the first to give it a different meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, but while others looked at you and saw a scarred lady, I saw a very beautiful woman. One whose entire feature was just stunning.&#34; He brought a hand to my face, running a finger down my cheek.&#34;How could anyone have called you ugly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my gaze again just as another tear escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t stop me from crying. He gave me some minutes before speaking up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to the babies? I think l&#39;d have known if you had any with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. Was I supposed to tell him the truth? That Penelope said they were alive but the damn woman couldn&#39;t remember a thing? He might probably end up killing Penelope. Jaris&#39; eyes suddenly came to my neck, and an eerie light shadowed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they...&#34; His brows furrowed. &#34;Didn&#39;t they make it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when I realized he was referring to the locket on my neck; the one with the ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are they the ones you&#39;ve been carrying all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself nodding before | could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand rose to it, touching the cold metal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain in his eyes was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They didn&#39;t make it,&#34; he repeated it like it was hard to believe,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That day, I seized this. You stayed out there in the cold for hours, waiting for me. I had no idea I&#39;d been punishing you with something this sensitive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze met mine again. &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I forced a smile, feeling so terribly that I was lying to him yet again. Maybe | didn&#39;t deserve someone like him. &#34;It wasn&#39;t your fault. You had no idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying on the topic was getting difficult. I dived into a new one as quickly as | could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. I&#39;m tired and just need some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged him, resting my head on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still didn&#39;t seem relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have a problem, Lyric,&#34; he said after a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled away from the hug to stare into his face. He looked serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What problem again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand came to my hair, stroking some strands away. &#34;It&#39;s not for you to worry about. I just need you to do something for me tomorrow. Do you think you&#39;ll be strong enough to stand before the Council?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands separated from his waist as my heart kicked into overdrive. Please, no. The Council had to do with the Elders and every single Alpha. Why was a meeting still being held for them? Was I still a problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris held my hands, giving them a tight squeeze as he sensed my growing panic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just need to fix things once and for al, Lyric. You can be rest assured that I&#39;ll be right there with you,and I promise you, no one is going to touch a single hair on your head. You have my word for that.&#34;</p>
