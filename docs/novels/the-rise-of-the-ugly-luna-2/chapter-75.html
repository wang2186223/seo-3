                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time went still for a long while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun from the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, looking in the direction Marta had just taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I think you&#39;re mistaken, Jace. Maybe you&#39;re mistaking the month or-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can forget anything, but not Karen or what we shared in that brief moment. We met on the thirteen of June. Does that sound too precise for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, running his fingers through his hair. &#34;While I was overseas, I met her in Oryndor.We happened to be in the same hotel. I was in the lounge area, drinking when she came up to me. She started the conversation, and well, I was bored and played along. Next thing, we both end up in my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, lifting a hand to my mouth. &#34;Y-You had sex!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we wouldn&#39;t be reading in my room, Lyric. So,yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She told me she&#39;d simply been horny and wanted it to be a one-time stuff. But the next day, we had more sex. Look, what happened between us isn&#39;t the point here. The point is, Marta was never pregnant. She should have been eight months pregnant when I met her right? I touched that belly. And trust me when l say there were no twins in it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gods.&#34; My hand was on my chest. I feared I might have a panic attack. I looked at my best friend with all seriousness. &#34;Please, tell me you&#39;re not mistaken. What if it&#39;s just someone that looks like her?&#34; &#34;Come on, Ly. Wouldn&#39;t this explain why she has been scared around me? We met in a very far country. We both didn&#39;t know each other and didn&#39;t expect we&#39;d find ourselves here. That&#39;s the reason she&#39;s shocked. I&#39;m thinking she must have traveled under the guise of birthing the kids outside the country. She must&#39;ve been so desperate for Jaris&#39;attention that she&#39;d set up something like this to give him kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace!&#34; I squealed. This was no small revelation.My fingers were practically shaking. &#34;If Marta wasn&#39;t pregnant... does this mean Xyla and Xylon do not belong to Jaris!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged, but I could see the sadness in his eyes too. &#34;That&#39;s the bitter truth, Lyric. Jaris has been taking care of another man&#39;s kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands wouldn&#39;t stop shaking on the wheel.Her face was streaked with tears, she considered it a miracle she didn&#39;t run into a car the entire drive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She parked carelessly in the middle of the compound, jumped out of the car and ran into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s always hated her family home and only came when she was repeatedly summoned. But today, she came of her own accord. She was losing her mind and needed their help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She barged into the living room and found her narcissistic sister kissing a man on the couch.One of their guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They quickly disengaged at her abrupt entrance,shocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell,Marta!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s everyone? Where&#39;s grandma?&#34; She panted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma is upstairs. And why are you looking like your life is about to end?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Any other day, Marta would&#39;ve had a good time replying her sister. But not tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran up the stairs and barged into her grandmother&#39;s room without knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman had been sitting by the bed and looked around in fright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta Monroe. Have you finally lost it?&#34; She rasped.She hated such abrupt entrance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Grandma please,&#34; Marta fell on her knees, fresh tears running down her cheeks. &#34;I&#39;m in trouble. I&#39;m in trouble. I don&#39;t-I don&#39;t know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandmother regarded her with a cold expression. But since she hadn&#39;t yelled at her, Marta figured she must be interested in what she had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now what trouble have you gotten yourself into?&#34;Her voice was less scolding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about the kids. Someone... Someone is about to expose me.&#34;</p>
