                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been eager to get this meeting done and over with. Caden wanted to see me? That he will get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion were already waiting by the car. I was almost out of the living room when I heard someone running from behind me. I&#39;d recognize Maddy&#39;s tiny footsteps anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you going?&#34; She looked like she was irritated standing before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give her a response, because I didn&#39;t know what gave her the impression that she could question me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you going to see Caden?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that got a reaction out of me. &#34;Who the hell told you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it wasn&#39;t difficult figuring it out. I mean, he just tortured Lyric. Something told me he&#39;d send a message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Well, you have your answer,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to leave, but she held my hand, forcing my gaze back on her. &#34;You can&#39;t kill him, Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand dropped from mine. &#34;No matter what&#39;s happened, he&#39;s our brother. You must remember that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden is no brother of mine. Not after what he&#39;s done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look,&#34; she crossed her arms. &#34;I hate him for what he did to Lyric, okay? But you&#39;re not killing him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned serious, and I knew what she was about to say next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s funny how everyone thinks Caden is a monster. The Hexed Wolf with partial immortality and psychopathic urges. Between the both of you, people think you&#39;re the saint. The good brother. They have no idea...that you two are just the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw went taut, knowing she&#39;d got me right where she wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You are also a Hexed wolf. But while you learned to control your psychopathic urges a little bit, Caden didn&#39;t. But people don&#39;t know that. And now, he&#39;s the only one seen as a Hexed wolf. He can only be killed by his kind-which is you. Same way you can only be killed by him. And now, I am telling you for the last time;you must not kill him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared down at her, myblood turning to ice in my veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not saying a word, I turned around and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew where he wanted us to meet. It was a two hour drive from Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t need us to go in with you?&#34; Nerion asked,looking displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him. &#34;You of all people should know no harm is coming to me. Do as I said and drive far away from here. I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m done and need you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went off, going into the abandoned temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even after so many years, the place was still desolate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden and I used to come here to play when we were younger. We&#39;d bring some of our friends too.Sometimes, even girls that ended up having fun with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was our favorite place to be-away from Darkspire, from our demanding father, the people who expected too much from us. This was our safe haven.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cobwebs greeted me when I got to the entrance. I made my way into the vast hall, and there he was, seated in the middle of the hall, at a small table I was sure he&#39;d arranged because they weren&#39;t there before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were four people in the room with him, staying close to the wall. The bastard wanted me to come alone but didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway,good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it isn&#39;t my dearest brother.&#34; He spread his arms, releasing a wolfish grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes on him as I walked to the table but didn&#39;t take a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a moment to take him in. I hadn&#39;t seen him in eight years. He looked different than I remembered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m glad you came. I&#39;ve been waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held the arm of the seat in front of me, my fingers tightening around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, you could&#39;ve simply asked me to come and I&#39;d have shown up. There was no point involving Lyric,&#34; I told him calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged casually. &#34;I just wanted to hurt something of yours. Lyric was a good option. By the way, how&#39;s she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;Better than yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah! What a relief. I hope you don&#39;t mind sending my regards.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Please, take a seat. We have a lot to talk about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t move, my eyes pinned on him. He held my stare, amusement in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I acted, shocking everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using my Alpha speed, I moved around the room, ripping out the hearts of everyone I could lay hands on.I moved at the speed of lightning, too fast for them to do anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I stopped, there were three hearts on the floor and one decapped head lying next to them. It felt like a breath of fresh air, filling my lungs with an intense satisfaction rather than air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fixed my gaze on Caden as I withdrew my napkin from the back of my pants and started wiping my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on his face made me want to do this again. He looked gutted. Like a ball of flame waiting to This was what I&#39;d been dying to do since yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve come with more of your men7said honestly.&#34;Well, I do hope these ones were important to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing. It was my turn to smile. &#34;Looks like you&#39;re not so smart-mouthed after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a seat, facing him with the table between us. Then, I threw the bloody napkin in front of him. &#34;Now,why don&#39;t we start talking. I don&#39;t have all day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, intertwining his hands on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris Dreadmoor. You shouldn&#39;t have done that.&#34; His voice was frosty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Caden well enough to know when one of his favorite toys had been damaged. Those men were very important to him. Like his right hands or somnething. The satisfaction knowing I killed them...it was second to none.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also leaned forward, placing my hands on the table, imitating his position.&#34;And you shouldn&#39;t have touched what was mine.&#34;</p>
