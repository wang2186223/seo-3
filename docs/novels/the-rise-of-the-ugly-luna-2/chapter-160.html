                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We derived joy and I found myself loving the way his hand moved around the steering. Like it was the first time I was seeing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We drove in silence, buildings and people passing us by.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached a quiet place in Darkspire and that was when he stopped, by the side of the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around and was confused. We weren&#39;t close to the Park. So, why did he stop?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could throw the question at him, he spoke up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve never had a real girlfriend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brain hit a brief pause. The world outside was suddenly blurred as I focused on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Etta and I...we were never in a relationship; we only had an understanding. My brother and I were simply playing games with her at first. She didn&#39;t care and let us do what we wanted to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And by playing with her, he meant sleeping with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Until one day, Caden became more attracted to her and wanted to keep her for himself. I backed off and he believed she was his girlfriend. But unknown to him, Etta had always had eyes for me. The reason she agreed to be with my brother and I was because it was the only way she could be near me. She told Caden she couldn&#39;t be with him and always came to be with me. But I stll didn&#39;t want her. Never been the type to want something serious with girls.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; The question slipped from my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and chuckled. &#34;A lot of people wanted my brother and I because of our status. Our Pack has always been the highest ranking. Most of them wanted me more because they knew I was better &#34;Etta choosing me, it caused a rift between Caden and I. She was quite beautiful, and maybe, overtime, I became attracted to her. Yes, red was her favorite. But I don&#39;t like red lipstick because of her.&#34; He turned on his seat to lock eyes with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Etta was the first girl I did pay attention to. I always saw her on red lipstick and realized I enjoyed seeing it on the ladies | like.I realized it was a beautiful color for the lips. But that&#39;s as far as it goes, Lyric. It&#39;s just like someone introducing you to a new meal which is their favorite. You taste the meal, fall in love with it, and it also becomes your favorite. That doesn&#39;t mean each time you eat it, you&#39;re thinking of that person.It just simply became your favorite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard holding a grudge against him after all these. He spoke to me like a teacher would a child.It amused me that he cared this much about my feelings and really wanted to clear things up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest swelled with pride. If the circumstances were different, I&#39;d have given him a hug right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand.&#34; I nodded. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let a brief moment pass before I added. &#34;He... also said you killed her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He readjusted himself to face forward, his hand tightening around the steering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was an accident,&#34; his voice had turned frosty. &#34;I&#39;d never intentionally hurt Etta on my own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was an accident, Lyric. Leave it be.&#34; His voice was a little rough it startled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath as he pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just hate talking about it. But if you could trust me, then you must know it was an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, already scared of insisting on it. Besides, if it was something he could talk about, I was sure he would have already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We should go homeadded with a small smile. &#34;I could really use a warm bath right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That brought a small smile from him. He started the car, but before we could get back to the road, he got a call. The phone was beside him, so l could see it was Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked the call and put it on speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s voice didn&#39;t sound pleasant when he spoke.&#34;Alpha, you&#39;ll want to get down here. Millow street. It&#39;s important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Millow Street was just within Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I headed there and arrived in less than twenty minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and some of the guards were gathered there, making me more worried. Was one of our people dead again? For three weeks, there&#39;s been no more deaths. I was hoping it was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Jaris out of the car, and just like I feared, there was a body on the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The person&#39;s wrist had been slit, and his face was pale which was something that only happened when a Feeder drained you of your blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did a Feeder get in when you&#39;ve been keeping an eye out for them?&#34; Jaris questioned the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We apologize, Alpha. We were very careful and have no idea how this one must&#39;ve found his or her way in,&#34;one of the guards said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This one seems a bit strange, though,&#34; Kael pointed out. &#34;Normally, the Feeders use their fangs to pierce the neck and drink immediately. But there were no bite marks on this person&#39;s neck. The only mark is the one on his wrist, and it seems that was where his blood was drained from. The wrist was slit by a claw,which doesn&#39;t seem like the Feeders way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, are you saying this might not have been a Feeder?&#34; Jaris asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We can&#39;t say for sure. Since their blood was drained, it&#39;s possible it was them. Perhaps, they&#39;re trying out a new method or something.&#34; Jaris remained silent for some time, as did everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Identify the body and let his family know.&#34; He turned to the guards.&#34;1need you to be more useful around here.You only have one job at night-stop those monsters from getting into my Pack.&#34;②</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They bowed their heads. &#34;We&#39;ll try our very best, Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt colder as we walked back to the car. Jarisalso looked worried. It was more noticeable when he was away from his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure this will come to an end soon,&#34; I said to him, trying to help with the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed his hands through his hair as he shook his head, but he didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand reached for the key to turn on the ignition, but before he could touch it, something strange happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He suddenly groaned and fell backward,hitting his head on the seat rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris!&#34; I took off my seatbelt and held him. &#34;What is wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand gripped his forehead, like it was aching. My anxiety shot to a whole new level when I noticed he was bleeding from the nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No. What was happening?</p>
