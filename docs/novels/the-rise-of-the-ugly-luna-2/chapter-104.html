                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched my brows at her but didn&#39;t say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know there&#39;s something you&#39;re keeping from everyone I may not really know what it is, but I can smell it around you-fishy.&#34; She sniffed the air.&#34;There is something fishy about you. I have always been able to tell each time I laid eyes on you. And you know if you sit on that throne-&#34; she pointed at the empty throne ontop the stage. &#34;-there would be chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged my shoulders with nonchalance. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Selestia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, we both know you do.&#34; She turned to the elders.&#34;He can&#39;t be on that throne. You can&#39;t let it happen.I am telling y/ou, if Jaris Dreadmoor rules us all, he&#39;d bring destruction upon us. He is bad for this. Very bad.&#34;Her eyes were darker as she returned them to me.&#34;And he knows it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held her gaze, not giving any expression,whatsoever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Selestia, come on,&#34; Luca frowned. &#34;You must be stressed. You should go on and get some rest.&#34; &#34;Won&#39;t you consider a word I just said?&#34; She snapped at him, stomping her foot in anger. &#34;I just told you Jaris Dreadmoor is bad for us. But of course, you won&#39;t listen. You won&#39;t listen because you are obsessed with him! You think he is our best option! Oh,he will make us suffer!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my phones and lifted myself, absolutely done with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be on my way now.&#34; I nodded to the elders.&#34;Thank you for arranging this meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was off, leaving Selestia seething with rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think that was about?&#34; Kael asked as soon as we got outside and started heading to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion, who had been supervising the place, came to join us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t care. It&#39;s not news that Selestia can be crazy sometimes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out my phone to check if Lyric had responded to the text I sent during the meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Did you have to reject the gift? What&#39; is wrong with you?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was what I sent to her. But she hadn&#39;t replied. Same way she hadn&#39;t returned my calls in the past two days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was starting to get on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric is being too difficult.&#34; I found myself opening up to Kael. &#34;She still won&#39;t talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...to be honest, I think she has the right to be,&#34;Kael said to my surprise. &#34;I wasn&#39;t there to hear what you told her, but I&#39;m damn sure you were very rude.And if you really asked her to go sleep with other men,you were really really wrong, Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to roll my eyes at him. &#34;I didn&#39;t ask fora scolding, Kael. If you can&#39;t help, just stop talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged and said nothing else until we reached the car. I settled into the backseat while he joined Nerion in the front seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay.Maybe there was something wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fucked up. And as much as I hate to admit it, I missed having Lyric around. I missed bumping into her on the passage. I missed seeing her with her red lipstick on.I missed watching her with the kids. I missed her smiles.Her daughters. And even that silly frown of hers. 4</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking hell,&#34; I mumbled as I pulled around my collar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt hot all of a sudden. Hot and uncomfortable. Why the hell does she have this effect on me? Why do I miss her so much?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think I can do to get her to forgive me?&#34;The question was out before | could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously,Jaris? How&#39;re you so helpless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked at me and smirked. Nerion glanced at me through the rearview mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean,I thought she&#39;d appreciate my presents. They were quite expensive, you know? I&#39;m trying to do some good here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maybe she just needs an apology.&#34; Nerion shrugged,cutting into the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face crumbled as I looked at him like he&#39;d just said something ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been to her place, gotten her presents,given her calls. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve actually apologized to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed, dragging my gaze to the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s right, Alpha.&#34; Kael supported. &#34;You know you&#39;re on the wrong here. Maybe apologizing and acknowledging what you did would go a long way.&#34; I go completely silent, because I knew they were right.The only problem was, I hated apologizing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I apologized to Marta a week ago, it was the first time I&#39;d done so in years. I couldn&#39;t even remember the last time | apologized for something before Marta. And I&#39;d only done so because it involved our kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d doubted her, hurt her, and even distanced myself from the kids. She deserved that apology.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But aside that, I didn&#39;t think I could apologize to anyone.But now I have to, to Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A call coming into my phone distracted me. A welcome distraction, actually.I quickly answered when I discovered it was Margaret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, Alpha Jaris. I just sent the pictures and details of the Siphon to you. Sorry it took this long. It was hard reaching the Executioners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I simply said before ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly went to my email and found the recent one from Margaret. I clicked it open and downloaded the image.When it opened, the phone almost slipped from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shut my eyes and shook my head. I opened my eyes again, but the image in front of me did not change.For a moment, I thought I must have been imagining things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how was this possible?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; I mumbled as I zoomed into the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boss, is there a problem?&#34; Nerion ahead, looking at me through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Siphon was &#39;Princess&#39;. The very girl I&#39;d been longing to see again for five years. The one that had abandoned me at the hotel, taking a piece of my heart with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it possible? She was the Siphon and had helped release my brother?! How could she do this?</p>
