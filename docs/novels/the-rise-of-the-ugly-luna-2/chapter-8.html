                <p>&#34;It must be mere luck,&#34; she cleared her throat. &#34;I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t have to do much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to laugh. Mere luck? Did she have any idea the effort I had to put in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped away from the door. &#34;Leave. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a spitting second, I wondered why Jaris wasn&#39;t making her his Luna. She looked beautiful and already had kids for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry l invaded your kids&#39; privacy. The little boy just needed help, and I thought it&#39;d be wrong to ignore him.&#34; Dipping my head, I left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what would happen the moment I walked out on them. My mother was never one to let things go,especially not this. Although, for the first time, I wish she&#39;d get off my back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My beta Kael, and head of security Nerion, waited outside my room. I was trying to take off my accessories when she entered, her eyes anything but pleased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing, Jaris? We&#39;ve been waiting for over an hour.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know she was angry enough to want to yell, but my mother knew better than to yell at me. It wasn&#39;t an action that was appreciated by me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t ask anyone to wait,&#34; I answered without looking at her as I unstrapped my watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, come on! We&#39;ve discussed this already. It is important you have a Luna at this time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, pardon me, mother, if I&#39;m not too eager to bond with someone I feel nothing for and never will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And nobody&#39;s asking you to feel anything for her. As a matter of fact, it&#39;s only going to be for a year!Bennett&#39;s daughter is the only necessity that you are well aware of. In a year, we&#39;ll be through wvith her-that is, if she survives-and truthfully, you know I don&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But you only have to put up with her for a year,Jaris.Hopefully, before then, we&#39;d have found your mate,and she would become the true Luna of the people.&#34;I did not miss the smile that crossed her face.&#34;Everything would be perfect. Just do this, please.Besides, the elders are beginning to talk. We have to get them off our backs. It&#39;s like killing two birds with one stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m tired, mother. Let&#39;s save this riveting talk for later, when I can actually pretend to care,&#34; I cut her off, honestly tired of hearing her say things | didn&#39;t want to hear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll go. But you need to see her, at least,&#34; she spoke the words like a bargain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew my mother had a point. I urgently needed a Luna for two reasons, but the thought of being with someone | felt absolutely nothing for irritated me.I didn&#39;t want to be with anyone. &#34;Let her go. I do not want to see her. Not now, at least.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m done with this conversation. And trust me,mother, my ability to stay polite is slipping fast.&#34; My tone had no room for further argument, and my gaze when I looked at her was icy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t exactly be faulted. Growing up, I&#39;ve always hated to be controlled. And when I finally became Alpha, it grew worse. I didn&#39;t like anyone telling me what to do. I also didn&#39;t like to be disobeyed. If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that she was my mother, there would have been repercussions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, she did leave, giving me some space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished undressing and changed into a simpler outfit for the night. I hada lot of work to do, but my mood had already been ruined. So, I simply took a seat at my study table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside me, there was a safe. Inputting my passcode, I took out the photo. A certain calm enveloped me,but at the same time, I felt a sharp sting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After five years, I couldn&#39;t believe | was yet to get over her. Who was she and what did she do to make me so addicted? Why did she have to hurt me the way she did?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I traced my fingers along the outline of her face. It was a faint image of her leaving the hotel that morning. It wasn&#39;t clear, but it was better than having nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just an image, yet it meant the world to me.Whatever happened to her? Was she dead? Because for five years, I&#39;d been searching for her but to no avail.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only my mother could understand that I felt nothing for Bennett&#39;s daughter or my fated mate she&#39;s been desperately searching for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In our world, seeing your fated mate was rare. Most times, we had to choose a person we were attracted to. I&#39;d found my fated mate nine years ago, but lost her before we could even bond. And since then,mother had been keen on finding her. But I didn&#39;t care even about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only woman I cared about was the very one in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the one I wanted to make my permanent Luna.Where did she go?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, when I was sure the unwanted guests were gone, I left to check on the kids. Fortunately,Xyla and Xylon were playing on the bed with Xyla giggling &#39;cause she was winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed up at the sight-my favorite sight.These days, they were the only reason I get to experience true joy, even if I could hardly express it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was by the side of the room, mixing something in a bowl. And I didn&#39;t miss the interest that sparked in her eyes when she saw me. Upon seeing me, the kids jumped out of bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy! Are you donefor the day?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She did most of the talking as Xylon had problems expressing himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the next one minute, we had a light conversation on how both our days went.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy, Xylon had one of his crises today,&#34; Xyla said,shattering the tiny peace I felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you?&#34; I looked at him, running my fingers through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped to the floor, indicating his sadness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was always a torment for him, and it broke me each time he suffered it without remedy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For years, I&#39;d employed the best doctors from all over the world to treat him, not none had been able to help. It was devastating that there were certain things my wealth and title could not solve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But he had quickly gotten better!&#34; Xyla expressed. &#34;Unlike before, he didn&#39;t suffer for much today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. &#34;Okay. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone treated him.&#34;</p>
