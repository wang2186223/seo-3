                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The faces of the Executioners were taut as I rejoined them in the room.Well, my own face didn&#39;t look any different.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the way Cole&#39;s eyes narrowed when he didn&#39;t see Lyric behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, My King, where is Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t be joining us,&#34; I said, matter-of-factly as l reached my spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole wasn&#39;t the only one who looked shocked and uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t understand. Why won&#39;t she? You know this is a serious issue, Your Highness! We can&#39;t just sweep it under the rug like it&#39;s nothing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, she needs to be here,&#34; another Executioner said, though I could see how much he was dying to get rid of the &#39;please&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is,&#34; I shrugged. &#34;But I don&#39;t feel like discussing it on a night like this. Not anymore.&#34; I started to retreat.&#34;There are people out there waiting to celebrate with me. This meeting is over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I feIt their eyes on me as I walked out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I&#39;d used the celebration as an excuse to keep them away from Lyric, I couldn&#39;t enjoy even a little bit of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over and over, my mind kept going back to the lady in the room who was alone and worried sick. I might&#39;ve stalled the Executioners for tonight, but I knew l couldn&#39;t go on with this for long. By dawn, the celebrations would be over and reality will have to kick in. And honestly, I didn&#39;t know what to do with Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long before the party ended, I grew tired and retired to the room. I&#39;d been lucky enough to avoid my mother and some of the Elders who had been trying to hold a private conversation with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I unlocked the door to a startled Lyric. She literally jumped on her feet and only relaxed when she realized it was me coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so bad for her. It was even worse that I didn&#39;t know what to do with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Princess. Who would&#39;ve thought that the smart-mouthed Lyric Harper was the same girl? She&#39;d really grown in confidence and all, and I loved her for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are-Are they gone?&#34; She asked with her eyes going behind me, even though I&#39;d shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. For tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the bed, holding her head in her hands. She looked so stressed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. You need to rest.&#34; I went closer to take her hand, but she was on her feet before I could reach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I need to get out of here,&#34; she was frantic with worry.&#34;I could go far away, make sure they never see me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to be on the run?&#34; | cut in with a scoff.&#34;With my child?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funny how when I thought of how bad the situation was, helping Lyric &#39;escape&#39; as a solution never crossed my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, what am I supposed to do?! I could be dead tomorrow with this said child!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat on the arm of the chair, digging her fingers into her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| have to get out of here. I have to save myself.&#34; The last word broke into a whimper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my ground for several moments, taking in the heartbreaking scene of her collapse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time since I discovered the shocking news today,the reality hit me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was a Siphon-something that was greatly forbidden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her kind was never supposed to exist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the new King, it was my responsibility to protect the people from someone like her-like it&#39;s been going on for ages. I was expected to hand her over to the Executioners so they could carry out their judgement -which would be death.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was Lyric Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one woman that had brought out a different part of me. The only one to make me feel things I never thought were possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric, the one who was there when she should&#39;ve fled.The one who gave herself up to keep my kids safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the woman I love. Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fucking loved her and would die before I let something happen to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,how could I possibly hurt her when she meant the world to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, what was I supposed to say to the people?How was I meant to handle the Executioners?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to leave,&#34; she got on her feet again, wiping tears from her eyes. She was so restless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could go at midnight.I&#39;ll-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not leaving, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?! Because I&#39;m carrying your child? My life is at stake here, you know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My face wrinkled from her statement. &#34;It&#39;s not about the child!&#34; I yelled at her. &#34;If you run, you&#39;ll be declared wanted. How far do you really think you can go when every wolf on the planet is looking for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to make her go shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Running isn&#39;t the solution. You have to stay back and fight this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fight?&#34; She scoffed, furrowing her brows. &#34;How am I  supposed to fight this? I&#39;m already a major suspect There&#39;s no stopping the Executioners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grew uncomfortable the more she talked. She&#39;d been stressing herself lately and I was afraid it wasn&#39;t needed for her condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went closer, taking her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dragged her legs to a stop when she noticed we were heading toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t go outside!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, Lyric. No one is hurting you tonight.&#34; She hadn&#39;t even been found guilty yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give her the chance to protest as | fully pulled her out of the room with me.</p>
