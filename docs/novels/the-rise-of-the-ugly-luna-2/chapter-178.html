                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes glittered like a neon bulb. If I wasn&#39;t this sick,I&#39;d have burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t mean to disregard your help, Guinevere,but there&#39;s no need for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the file casually. Funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure? Because I know a pregnant woman when I see one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,goodness.What was she talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Trust me, Guinevere, I&#39;m not pregnant. If there was even the slightest chance of it, I&#39;d know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez,it was weird even talking about it. How could I be pregnant when I hadn&#39;t had sex until two days ago?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sound like you and the Alpha haven&#39;t been intimate,&#34; she said with a teasing smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;N-No! It&#39;s not what I meant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, until just two days ago,we actually haven&#39;t. &#34;We&#39;ve been careful, that&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded with a smile, and just like that, the topic died down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The highlight of the day arrived. The plan I&#39;d been cooking for weeks since Marta hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was a fool to think I&#39;d let everything go after killing innocent people in my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was excited when I got a call from Thomas, telling me he was outside already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thomas was a hacker Juan recommended to me. I got him to hack into our CCTV footage and check if any clip was deleted on certain dates.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met him in his car where he handed an envelope to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were right. Some clips had been deleted. There&#39;s a chip in there containing the missing footage,&#34; he told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eagerly, I inserted the chip into the laptop I&#39;d come with and watched the video in awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was right. Marta had gone into the inventory that day,just before l entered and took the drugs that killed the patients. Unfortunately, the camera was only positioned at the door and showed the people that went in and out, not the activity taking place in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But maybe, this could prove Marta had something to do with the mix-up,right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I played the next clip and couldn&#39;t help the smile that covered my face. It was a footage of me going into the rooms of the people I&#39;d treated but ended up losing the glory to Marta. Mr. Owens, Pete and the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bitch actually deleted the footage so she could conveniently lie it was her. When I asked the security team for the footage back then, they&#39;d told me they simply couldn&#39;t find them. Who knew they were working for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is great, Thomas,&#34; I put the chip back in the envelope.&#34;Thank you. You&#39;ll get your balance shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My pleasure, ma&#39;am. Don&#39;t forget to contact me if you need anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words brought me to a slight halt. There was actually something I might need his expertise on since he was so good at hacking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stil didn&#39;t know how those pills had entered my room.There was no footage when I checked the cameras that day, yet I knew there was no way those pills had magically implanted themselves in my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I might give you a call soon. Thanks.&#34; I left the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat with my arms crossed, my heart brimming with joy and anticipation as Marta walked into the meeting room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her footsteps until she was standing beside me,close enough for me to see the confusion on her face.She was probably wondering why she was summoned to the meeting room where four Superiors and three members of the tech team were in. Not to mention me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Guinevere, you sent for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to applaud her for how calm and unbothered she could be even in times like this. Well, let&#39;s see how long she puts up with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere went straight to the point. &#34;Specific footage had been missing from the system,&#34; she directed at the tech guys. &#34;I must say it&#39;s quite disappointing that you are this incompetent. In such cases, it&#39;s safe to get you fired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That isn&#39;t necessary, ma&#39;am. Those missing clips were as a result of a damaged part which has already been fixed. I assure you it&#39;ll not happen again,&#34; the head of tech explained. I noticed him glance at Marta who wasn&#39;t looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is that so?&#34; Guinevere scoffed. She shifted her gaze to Marta. &#34;Ms. Monroe, do you mind explaining why you were in all of these missing clips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta wore her perfectly confused face. &#34;I don&#39;t think I understand-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere turned her system to her. I couldn&#39;t help a smile as the clips played one after the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mask slipped. She was damn worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;On this day, you told me it was you who performed surgery on Mr. Owens. But from the clip, you spent less than three minutes in there while Lyric had spent close to an hour. Which of you would you say performed the surgery?&#34; Guinevere questioned her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s eyes darted to mine, a silent threat in them.Oh,to hell with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t really- I mean...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Marta Monroe stuttering for words. The sight was gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And this-&#34; Guinevere pointed at the clip of me going into Pete&#39;s room beforr Marta did. After I treated him,Marta didn&#39;t go into the man&#39;s room until she was summoned by Guinevere when he was conscious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me you treated him, not Lyric. Have you been lying all these while? Taking the glory for someone else&#39;s hard work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,I can explain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you also went into the inventory just before Lyric went in that day to get drugs. Did you by any chance swap those labels to get her in trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I&#39;d never do such a thing!&#34; She panicked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, explain why all of these footages containing your face were missing, Marta,&#34; another Superior said.&#34;To say I am disappointed in you would be an understatement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, you have to believe me. I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I-I honestly don&#39;t know why these footages were missing. Shouldn&#39;t the tech guys be blamed for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere scoffed. &#34;You know, from the onset, Marta,I have always had this uneasy feeling about you.Something about you always screamed dubious. Who knows? Maybe it&#39;s the reason the Alpha didn&#39;t make you his Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woah. That was a bit personal. Yet,I tried and failed to suppress my smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Marta spoke again, her voice told me she&#39;d started crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s not what you think.&#34; She pointed at me. &#34;Did she do this? You&#39;re seriously going to take her word over mine? Can&#39;t you see she&#39;s trying to pin all the blame on me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she didn&#39;t make you lie about treating her patients, did she?&#34; Another supervisor asked,throwing her a glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, Ms. Monroe, we understand why you&#39;d consider Ms. Dreadmoor a rival. But doing this-playing with work ethics and the lives of our patients... it&#39;s disappointing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all went on to express their disappointment in Marta that by the time they finished, she was a weeping mess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, there still wasn&#39;t enough evidence that she&#39;d switched the labels in the inventory. But they told her she was going to get sanctioned for every other thing she lied about. In the meantime, she was asked to pack up her things and go home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran out of the hall with tears while I left feeling a sense of fulfillment. It might not be enough for the lives she took, but at least, she did get disgraced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my shift ended in the evening and | returned home,the kids came to spend some time with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were playing a game when my door was abruptly opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta stormed into the room, her hair looking messy with mascara smeared over her eyes, a clear indication that she had been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was still wearing the clothes and had on from TCH which made me wonder where she had been since she left hours before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprang to my feet, but before I could react, she was already making her way across the room to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You bitch!&#34; Her hand connected to my face,striking me hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids shrieked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?! How fucking dare you try to sabotage me this way?!&#34; She hit me again. Rage filled me to the brim as I tried to hit her back.But she was faster, countered my strike and yanked my hair instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for her hair too but I was majorly trying to separate her from me. Damn it, I was trying so hard to control myself because of the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were screaming at us to stop. I even heard Xyla crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to stop, but Marta was out of her mind and wasn&#39;t letting me go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost the fight when she hit me in the belly. Normally,it shouldn&#39;t have hurt enough to weaken my defenses,but the thing hurt like a bitch, I basically screamed as I doubled over.</p>
