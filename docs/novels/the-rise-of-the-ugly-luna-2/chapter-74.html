                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party was beyond magnificent. It was heart-warming to see how much Jaris was loved by his people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a lot to eat, drink and talk about.The people of Darkspire were quite united. I could tell from how they gathered in groups and made jokes like one big family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A family I&#39;d never had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Luna.&#34; Someone nudged me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as Jace stood beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, dad.&#34; I lifted my glass to my lips to take a sip,but he snatched the flute from me, drinking instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I like how you pay me some respect. It shows l trained you well.&#34; &#34;You&#39;re an asshole, Jace.&#34; I slapped him on the shoulder.&#34;You just coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Had to stay back with my dad to discuss certain things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael walked up to us, holding a flute that was almost empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Lyric.&#34; His tone was clipped. The man was effortlessly grumpy even when he was attempting to be nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what?&#34; I chuckled. &#34;Alpha Jaris was the one who displayed his smartness, not me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s what they say. When the Alpha gets celebrated, so does his Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words warmed my heart more than I cared to admit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flicked my gaze toward Jaris in the corner,and there he was, staring back at me even though he was in the midst of six elders. I knew he was there because I&#39;d been stealing glances at him the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked away as quickly as I did, but not before heat radiated through my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I needed to find a way to stop this. I couldn&#39;t keep doing this to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s eyes roamed over Jace&#39;s body. &#34;Why don&#39;t you try to get a bigger size of this next time? I don&#39;t even understand if you lack the common knowledge of your measurement.&#34; He was referring to Jace&#39;s suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace glanced down at his suit and scoffed. &#34;Dude,get out of my face before I smash yours against the wall.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked at me. &#34;How do you cope being his friend, Lyric? I&#39;d rather be alone than have to spend a second with someone like him who hates correction as much as he hates having a brain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,for Moon&#39;s sake! &#34;Guys, this is a party. You can&#39;t do this here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jace was not one to lose a barb. &#34;It&#39;s hilarious that you think being alone is preferable when it clearly suits your personality so well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the room. Or rather, looked at Jaris.He was staring at us-me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed the tight lump in my throat, then whispered. &#34;Alpha Jaris is watching.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael&#39;s features softened. He looked disgusted, then did something Jace and I would never have imagined. To our utmost shock, he lifted his hand to Jace&#39;s hair, stroking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth fell open as Jace&#39;s brows shot up to his hairline. For three seconds, he was too shocked to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he regained composure, he slapped Kael&#39;s hand away. &#34;What the fuck, man? Have you lost it!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This time, I was speechless, my gaze flicking between the two men. Why would Kael do that in public?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax. I hate it as much as you do.&#34; The detest in his voice didn&#39;t make me doubt him. &#34;Like she said, Jaris was watching. I had to put on a show.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What fucking show? What business does your show have with touching me?&#34; Jace was trying to keep his temper down. If we weren&#39;t in a party, he&#39;d have definitely reacted much worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do you think you&#39;re here in Darkspire, standing close to and touching Lyric however you want?&#34; Kael rasped. &#34;You really think Jaris decided to be so generous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I asked what your excuse was to him, but you didn&#39;t fucking tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re smart, Jace.&#34; Kael shrugged, but he was pissed. &#34;I guess you should know now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. The truth dawned on me same time Jace&#39;s jaw dropped. He must&#39;ve realized it was well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Don&#39;t fucking say,&#34; he shook his head. &#34;| ain&#39;t doing that shit with you? What are you,stupid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I&#39;d never seen anyone more ungrateful than you, asshole.&#34; Kael gritted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell are you saying? Are your brain cells that dumb that you couldn&#39;t come up with a better excuse?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael stepped closer. &#34;He asked, okay? He thought that was the only reason I&#39;d want you here. It made sense when he brought it up. So I agreed for your sake. I told him I liked your stupid ass and wanted to have you close. That&#39;s the only reason he doesn&#39;t bother when you&#39;re with Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking hell!&#34; Jace angrily dropped his glass on the table. His eyes blazed when he faced Kael again.&#34;Well, you&#39;re on your own, bud. And bear this in mind, the next time you touch me like you just did,I promise it&#39;ll be the last time you have fingers.&#34; Thank goodness the hall was heavy with music.I wouldn&#39;t want to imagine people&#39;s reaction to a conversation like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace...&#34; I tried to speak to him, but he walked out on us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woah. I hadn&#39;t seen Jace this mad in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I went out to look for Jace. He had been gone for about fifteen minutes, making me worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, I found him by the pool side, smoking.I froze. Jace doesn&#39;t smoke unless he&#39;s really pissed.Like,very very pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this point,I wanted to believe he was overreacting over what Kael did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey. Give me that.&#34; I gently took the cigarette from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Putting it on the floor, I extinguished it with my heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crossed my arms as I faced him. &#34;Don&#39;t you think your reaction was a little over the top? Kael was only trying to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Lyric. Don&#39;t start with me.&#34; He pinched the bridge of his nose, his eyes closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was clearly trying to control his temper around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, dad.&#34; I huffed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There. That was enough to get a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a deep breath, inserting his both hands into his pockets. He looked a bit calmer now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; My voice was mellow. &#34;You know you can talk to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something must have happened in the past to get such a reaction out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Forget it.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;Sorry I took you out of the party. We should head back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. Jace being polite to me. He was definitely not himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew him well enough to know if he didn&#39;t want to talk about something, he wouldn&#39;t. So, I let it be for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing him by the jacket, we started walking back to the party. But we stopped when we bumped into Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was making a phone call and appeared shocked when she saw us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to realize she wasn&#39;t being shocked at me, but the man beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karen?&#34; Jace called, squinting his eyes like he couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed in surprise. What was he saying?&#34;That&#39;s not...Karen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace looked at me like I&#39;d just told him the moon was pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta lowered the phone from her ear, but I wasn&#39;t even sure she&#39;d ended the call. I&#39;d never seen her this pale before. It was the exact way she looked when she had seen him in the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She is. I know her, Lyric. Do you know her?&#34; Jace asked, having the tone of someone that had just met an old acquaintance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t know me,&#34; Marta spoke up, her voice a little shaky. She cleared her throat, and when she spoke again, she sounded more like herself.&#34;I don&#39;t know you either. She&#39;s right. I&#39;m not Karen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clicked something on her phone, probably ending her call and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you saying? Don&#39;t you remember me?&#34;Jace chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s me, Jace. I know it&#39;s been years but we met in-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I said I don&#39;t know you!&#34; Her voice was near a shout,her eyes blazing fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mask slipped. She wasn&#39;t just furious. She was scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stretch between the two. Marta glared at me, then at Jace, and walked away. &#34;What was that about?&#34; | turned to Jace as soon as we were alone. &#34;How&#39;s she Karen to you? That&#39;s Marta Monroe. Jaris&#39; baby mama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s eyes rounded, disbelief glintingin them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s the mother of the twins?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. The very bitch I&#39;ve been telling you about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace shook his head, his eyes on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, what&#39;s wrong?&#34; I touched his arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His forehead was creased. &#34;Hold on, did you say the kids&#39; birthday is in three weeks?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What year were they born?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;2020.&#34; His questions were putting me on the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk to me, Jace. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means..&#34; he shook his head.not possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What isn&#39;t possible?&#34; &#34;She being their mother, Lyric!&#34; He darted his gaze at me. &#34;I met Karen...or Marta in 2020, just around this time. And when I did meet her, she wasn&#39;t pregnant.&#34;</p>
