                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were five of them, and they were already waiting in front of the morgue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Executioners always had one thing in common-looking scary and intimidating. One look and you&#39;d know you didn&#39;t want to mess with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, they&#39;ve been one of the bodies that operated outside the authority of the wolves. Most times,they didn&#39;t need approval to do what they wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; the one in front dipped his head when I got close, the others imitating his movement. &#34;The name is Cole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded before going into the morgue with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was told that she died here at your party,&#34; Cole said as I led the wvay</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have any suspects?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t. But I was hoping you would. Because I didn&#39;t invite your partner to my party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the fridge, the body was pulled out by one of the morgue assistants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These people had been trained to be cold-blooded monsters. If they felt anything for their dead partner in front of them, none of them showed it. Their faces were just as stoic as when they&#39;d come in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lucy,&#34; Cole said what was I was assuming was the lady&#39;s name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the female Executioner stepped forward and grabbed her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cole, look at this. The nail marks.&#34; The guy also observed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d seen the marks but didn&#39;t know what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Siphon,&#34; he muttered. &#34;She was killed by a Siphon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; Another said. &#34;A Siphon was at the party?&#34; This time, they directed their gaze at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I was sure they could see the confusion on my face because I sure as hell didn&#39;t know what they were talking about. Why would a Siphon be at my kids&#39; party?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;AlphaJaris, did you know anything about this?&#34; Cole asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I did, i&#39;d have said so by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Could it be the same one we&#39;ve been hunting?&#34; Another asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;ll make sense. Lucy probably had a lead on them which was the reason she cameto the party. Then,they killed her to protect their secret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why didn&#39;t she report the suspicion to us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as they deliberated the matter while I exchanged glances with Kael and Nerion. I knew the &#39;Siphon&#39; the Executioners have been hunting. It was the lady from six years ago. My &#39;Princess&#39;. The one who helped Caden escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was it possible that she was at thekids&#39; party? Why would she even come around?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold turned to me. &#34;Alpha Jaris, this is a very serious situation. I hope you&#39;ll be willing to cooperate with us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dangerous person was at your kids&#39; party and she needs to be found.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;I also want her found.&#34; And I meant it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to understand what she&#39;s been doing. She ran away at the hotel six years ago, only to help my brother escape. And now, she committed murder at my kids party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she been an enemy all along? Have I been fooled by her? &#34;First, we&#39;ll need a list of all the guests at the party.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And while we&#39;re waiting for that, we&#39;ll need to interrogate everyone present in the pack house, right this moment. It&#39;s also possible the suspect lives here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. &#34;That&#39;s not possible. If I had a Siphon living with me, I&#39;d have known.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With all due respect, Alpha Jaris, in our world, nothing is impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave the go-head for the interrogation. I wouldn&#39;t even know what to do if I discovered the Siphon had been with me this whole time. But they&#39;d sure as hell be sorry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They asked for a list of all the people living with us which we provided. To my surprise, they picked a name at random.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;d like to start with your mate, please. Lyric Dreadmoor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was with me in the room, assuring me that everything would be fine when Jaris and five unfamiliar people entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to be told. My guts told me who they were already. The Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was just something about their appearances that seemed to give their identities away. Like when someone had this constant stench and aura around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe if I wasn&#39;t in so much pain, I&#39;d have ran for the door already, screaming my lungs. My throat ran dry as I watched them make their way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They knew it was me, didn&#39;t they? Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jaris didn&#39;t seem angry. If he knew I was a Siphon and have been hiding under his roof this whole time,I was sure he&#39;d look much worse. &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Jace stood up, his eyes darting between Jaris and the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris ignored him and only looked at me. &#34;They&#39;re asking everyone questions. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just precautionary. I&#39;ve told them to make it quick with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 couldn&#39;t say a word, not even a nod. I could feel beads of sweats forming on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if my nervousness gave me away? I really needed to stop acting this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how was it possible? How could I do that when the very people that&#39;d been after me were right in front of me? They must be angrier now knowing I killed their own. They&#39;d strangle me to death when they learn the truth, and Jaris might not help. No. He might actually feel disgusted by me. I felt doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about your condition,&#34; the tallest man amongst them stepped forward. &#34;We&#39;ll try to keep this as brief .as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I couldn&#39;t do this. The Executioners could tell when someone was lying. So, if I do lie-which I have to-I&#39;d be caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, she doesn&#39;t need this.&#34; Jace stepped forward. &#34;Come on, Alpha Jaris. You know she&#39;s been through a lot lately. They should go question someone else. She doesn&#39;t know shit about what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris only glanced at Jace for a millisecond before looking at me with concern. &#34;Are you really not up for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris, please. We&#39;re not saying she&#39;s a suspect here. We just want to see if she knows something from that day that can help with your investigation,&#34; the tall Executioner said in a grumpy tone. It didn&#39;t look like he was ready to take no for an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris nodded at him, giving him the go-ahead. It looked like he was also eager to get this puzzle solved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Ma&#39;am Lyric, are you aware that someone died at the party that was held three days ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was painful to swallow down my dry throat. I lowered my head as I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d appreciate if you could look into my eyes while you answer.&#34; I hesitated. That was the only way he could tell if I was lying or not. But if I didn&#39;t do it, they might actually grow suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my eyes to meet his. He stretched his hand to a lady behind him who presented him with an iPad.He showed the screen to me, and on it was a picture of the dead Executioner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You killed her, Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you see this woman at any point in the party?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared longer at the screen, my heart threatening to explode in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only they didn&#39;t have the ability to detect lies, I wvould&#39;ve easily denied this. Gotten away with it. But l couldn&#39;t lie. I&#39;d give myself up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>replied as I looked him in the eye.</p>
