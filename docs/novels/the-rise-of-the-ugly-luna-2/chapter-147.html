                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished eating, a doctor came in to check on me. She brought me fresh clothes and applied something to my wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was funny how I could&#39;ve easily siphoned this pain away from others yet couldn&#39;t do the same for myself.That was the sick thing about Siphons. We could help others but not ourselves.O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor was still with me when Jaris returned. His shirt was soaked with sweat, like he had been gyming or running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy stood up from the bed as soon as she saw him, her jaw set in a frown.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should take my advice, Lyric. Come with me to my room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness,Maddy!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She huffed. &#34;I&#39;ll be leaving, then. I&#39;ll come check on you later.&#34; She left with the kids who had already hugged Jaris when he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s she?&#34; He asked the doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than yesterday, Alpha. A few more days and she&#39;ll be completely fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few more days. That sounded like days of torture to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctor rounded up and left, leaving me alone with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there something you need?&#34; His cold eyes on me gave me goosebumps. I could still see that he was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already ate. Thank you.&#34; There was a slight pause. &#34;But I-I need my phone. Was it on me when you found He opened the drawer and took it out. &#34;It was in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the phone from him, I made a mental note to call Jace and have him reach out to Penelope for me since I couldn&#39;t move around for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the thought crossed my mind, someone knocked on the door. Jars got it and found a guard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have Jace Ashford at the gate, Alpha. He&#39;s been making a scene and insists on coming in. We wanted to know how to proceed. Should we have him locked up and punished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in panic. Jace was at the gate?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. He shouldn&#39;t be here when he&#39;s been banished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris glanced back at me, seeing the panic on my face. In that moment, I feared what he&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;L-Let me talk to him. Please. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s just worried and here to see me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He is not supposed to be here. Rules are rules.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I know! But please!&#34; | tried to leave the bed in a rush and ended up hurting myself. I grunted and hissed as i fell back on the bed</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric! Will you stop moving?&#34; Jaris snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to stay still. &#34;1 will. But please, don&#39;t hurt him. Just let me talk to him,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately for me, Jaris listened. I was very surprised he actually did listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes later, Jace ran into the room. Jaris wasn&#39;t in anymore, so it was just the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was both shocked and pissed at the condition he found me in. He said Kael was the one who told him this morning. He was so worried that he dammed all consequences and came to see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is all fucked up. I mean, why the hell would that bastard attack you simply because you&#39;re Jaris&#39; mate?If he has a problem with his brother, why doesn&#39;t he go confront him?&#34; Jace didn&#39;t stop grumbling. It took a lot of time and effort to get him to stop talking about the issue and focus on something else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 decided I might need help since I wanted to stay back despite the threat on my head. Jace was the only one I could confide in. So I told him about the whole Executioner incident from yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; He sprang on his feet, his face alarmed. &#34;What the fuck did you just say, Lyric?! You killed an Executioner?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was about to expose me.I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on. You used your powers!&#34; He looked at me with disappointment. &#34;You&#39;ve been doing that research even after | told you to leave it alone!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, are you even listening to me?&#34; My voice rose a notch and I paid for it with my jaw. It hurt instantly,causing me to wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just told you-she was about to expose me. And I didn&#39;t even mean to kill her. l-I only wanted to Siphon her memories away. If I&#39;d known she was going to die, I promise I&#39;d have left her alone. But you can&#39;t blame me for not wanting to let her just walk away with my secret. If she had actually left, more of the Executioners would&#39;ve been here by now, torturing the truth out of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paced the room, brushing his hands through his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you were trying to leave without me,&#34;he mumbled.&#34;Damn it, Lyric! You&#39;d have been gone had Caden not kidnapped you! You&#39;d have really left without telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt tugged at my heart. &#34;I just didn&#39;t want to... drag you into my problems. I am the one who&#39;s a Siphon,Jace. You don&#39;t deserve to leave your life behind for my sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking as he looked at me and shook his head. &#34;You&#39;re silly. You know that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned to sitting on the edge of the bed, taking my hand into his. &#34;As soon as you&#39;re well enough to move freely, we&#39;re getting out of here. This time, there can&#39;t be any mistakes, Lyric. We-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; I withdrew my hand from his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fell to the sheets as l imagined how confused his expression would be. &#34;What the hell are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are...There are some things I need to take care of first. I just discovered them last night and can&#39;t leave them behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you for real? Things that are more important than your safety?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I said the word without the slightest hesitation. If my kids were really alive, then I&#39;d die for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace stood up again, shaking his head at me.&#34;What the hell is going on, Lyric? What&#39;re you keeping from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hold his gaze for long without feeling stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine. This was stupid. If I needed his help, then he had to know about everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath before meeting his gaze again.&#34;What I&#39;m about to tell you... I haven&#39;t told anyone.You need to keep this with you, Jace. No matter what.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His curiosity was ignited as he returned to sit beside me. Then I went ahead to tell him everything-about the pregnancy, Penelope, having and losing the babies, and getting to learn they might just be alive. In all of this, I didn&#39;t mention who the father was. No; nobody needed to know that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s expression was utter shock. For a full minute, he didn&#39;t even know how to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Moon gods,&#34; he finally mumbled, running his hand over his forehead.,there&#39;s a high chance you&#39;re a mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And I&#39;d do anything to meet them, Jace. Once I&#39;ve found them, we can finally leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But...you said Penelope has been unreachable. And it looked like someone was chasing her while she was revealing the information to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>frowned. &#34;Giving me the information at that very time,it felt like something was wrong. I was hoping her husband could hold some answers about her location.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I&#39;ll go over to his place and talk to him. But Lyric,&#34;he took my hand. &#34;Don&#39;t you think we should just get out of here at least? I promise to keep looking for answers and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not leaving without my kids, Jace.&#34; I shook my head. &#34;For six years now, I thought they were dead.You don&#39;t know how all of this seems like a dream to me. If they&#39;re truly alive, then I&#39;m never going to stop until l find them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He buried his face beneath his palms, muttering a &#39;fuck&#39; under his breath. &#34;I really need to move back here.I need to keep an eye on you before you do something more stupid. Who knows when more of the Executioners will come? I&#39;m guessing it won&#39;t take long once they learn that one of theirs is dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I&#39;d have appreciated Jace being here. But it was quite unfortunate he&#39;s been banished. He was actually lucky Jaris considered mny condition and let him in today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, revealing Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed him tighten up at the sight of Jace. His hatred for my best friend was palpable, and it made me sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fully dressed-wearing an all-black outfit. It made me wonder where he got the clothes from since he didn&#39;t change in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m heading out. If you need anything, do not hesitate to call for assistance,&#34; he said to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed at the thought of Jaris informing me he was heading out. He did it last night, now today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; I lowered my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought dawned on me, forcing me to snap my gaze up at him.&#34;Are-Are you...&#39; I didn&#39;t complete the question, but he knew what I meant and nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you should go?&#34; While I was already panicking, he didn&#39;t seem a bit fazed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care of yourself, Lyric.&#34; His gaze hardened as they shifted to Jace. &#34;Make sure you&#39;re gone before l get back.&#34; He went out the door, filling my mind with a suitcase full of anxieties.</p>
