                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace wasn&#39;t around to give me any form of advice. So,I had to go to Maddy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Lyric. Could you stop worrying about Jaris?Nothing could possibly happen to him. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s fine,&#34; Maddy grouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, why isn&#39;t he home? Even Nerion didn&#39;t know where he went last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop mentioning that name.&#34; She glared daggers at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Please, I&#39;m being serious here.I don&#39;t know, but I kind of think something might be wrong with him. Don&#39;t you think we should ask questions?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Eww. No. I don&#39;t care what happens to him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now I was starting to actually get pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I&#39;ll just do it myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left her room. Fortunately, when I got outside, I met Kael talking to some guards. This was looking like a search party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey. Is there any news on Alpha Jaris?&#34; I approached him when he&#39;d dismissed the men around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. We haven&#39;t seen him since yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up on pattering footsteps approaching, then turned to see Maddy rushing toward me, her face set in a frown. She was still wearing the same outfit from her room-a short jean skirt with a crop top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re stubborn, you know that? You keep making me do things I don&#39;t want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored her and turned back to Kael. I was actually grateful he was responding to me after what happened yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But didn&#39;t you all leave together yesterday morning?&#34;I asked him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We did. He just... insisted on going somewhere alone.And we haven&#39;t seen him since then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease clawed at my chest.&#34;Where was he going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He didn&#39;t say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet the look in his eyes told me he knew something else. &#34;Kael, come on. Tell me what you know. WNhat prompted him to want to go here alone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a moment before he sighed. &#34;We found another body yesterday, like the one we found that night. It had the same pattern. He suspects Caden.So,I&#39;m thinking he must&#39;ve gone there yesterday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We drove there last night, but there was no trace of either of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What pattern are you talking about?&#34; Maddy questioned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Their blood is drained in a different way. There&#39;s no bite marks, just a claw cut on their wrist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck,&#34; she took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My attention snapped to her at once. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she wasn&#39;t even looking at me. Her eyes were on the floor as she raked her fingers through her strands</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck. No. No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy, if you know something, say it,&#34; Kael popped with irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she didn&#39;t say a word. She just turned around and stormed into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****=</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MADDY</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mum!&#34; She yelled as she stormed into her mother&#39;s room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was on her massaging chair, napping while a maid was getting her nails done. She startled awake at the sound of Maddy&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Maddy growled at the maid.She wasted no time and hurried out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde was confused. &#34;Maddy, what is-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How perfect, mother?&#34; Maddy crossed her arms,her voice dripping with malice. &#34;Here you are, getting your nails done while both your sons are killing themselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isolde sat up. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you even aware that Jaris has been missing since yesterday?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Missing?&#34; She frowned. &#34;I-I just thought he was busy with something. I didn&#39;t hear anything about him missing. There is no way someone like him can go missing!&#34; &#34;ch, really?&#34; Maddy chuckled bitterly. &#34;Caden triggered his urges. Jaris is a mess right now. He&#39;s fed on our people for two days and had no control over it.He&#39;s becoming the monster he once was. And you;you&#39;re just here, getting your nails done. How convenient.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy, I had no idea!&#34; She sprang to her feet. &#34;Jaris doesn&#39;t open up to me. How am I supposed to know these things?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I told you to try and meet with Caden! The moment I heard he was back, I told you to try talking to him as a mother. But you wouldn&#39;t listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isolde&#39;s face turned spiteful. &#34;You know I do not wish to speak to him. He killed my husband!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, he didn&#39;t. Jaris did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, shut up. You keep arguing about this. Jaris never killed your father. Caden did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy shook her head, not ready for that very argument.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, if you&#39;d set your pride aside and talked to him as a mother, I&#39;m sure things would&#39;ve been different by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what makes you think he&#39;d have listened to me? Even as boys. Caden and laris never listened to anyone. Not to mention now that they&#39;re all grown-ups.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy shook her head. &#34;This-This is all fucked up.A kind of war we&#39;ve never experienced before is coming.&#34;She fisted her hands. &#34;You should&#39;ve just spoken to him, mother. It&#39;d have gone a long way.&#34;</p>
