                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was losing her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had spent a long time with her family trying to work up something against Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d contemplated killing her but were skeptical as it was risky. If Lyric survived and it&#39;s somehow traced to them, they&#39;d be doomed. If they had to kill her,it would need to be done smoothly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned home late and was furious when she checked on the kids and got to know from the nanny that they were at Lyric&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;d lost all sense of reasoning. All she could think about was the fact that Lyric was trying to take her kids from her. It rang in her head that the twins were actually with their biological mother. If she hated Lyric before, she despised her now. If there was a word greater than loathe, she&#39;d use it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted her as far away from her kids as possible. And she was ready to do anything to achieve that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the kids were back in their room, she proceeded to hers and put a call through to her grandmother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the family, she always preferred communicating with her grandmother because the woman was the smartest and was good when it came to important plans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is Marta? It&#39;s late.&#34; She sounded grumpy like always.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta went straight to the point, her voice cold. &#34;We need to take care of the woman. Penelope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a long pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; Her grandmother asked. &#34;She&#39;s a threat. She knows too much already. She even knows Lyric and her being the mother of the twins. How sure are we she won&#39;t try/ to snitch on us soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another moment of silence before her grandmother hummed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you&#39;re right. I&#39;ll have someone take care of it as soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the day of the second trial. Another important day in our world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished on time to join Jaris in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even before I opened the door, his sweet cologne welcomed me, captivating me completely. And when my eyes caught sight of him, I melted. He was beyond charming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it with you ladies always keeping the men waiting?&#34; He asked with a fake sigh of exhaustion as l settled beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you serious? I was so proud of myself for being early.&#34; I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you call this early, then I think TCH must&#39;ve suspended you for adifferent reason.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The laugh came out uncontrolled. I had to make sure the tears stayed back as I didn&#39;t want to ruin the makeup I had spent hours applying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look good, by the way,&#34; he complimented after a while when the laughter had died down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him before lowering my gaze to my thighs, biting the inside of my cheeks. &#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt the helpless blush crawling up my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting harder being around him without clenching my thighs. Everything about him-the sound of his voice, the way he smiled, the way he laughed-it helplessly reminded me of my &#39;dreams&#39;. I&#39;d taken the pills for two nights, and while I enjoyed the nights like always, I was starting to get really worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this just a dream? How can a pill be that powerful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, I&#39;d been blinded by my lust, I couldn&#39;t think of anything else. Like the fact that someone had actually dropped those pills in my room. Someone that wanted me to keep having those dreams of Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jaris who was busy with his phone. This time, it wasn&#39;t out of admiration. It was out of curiosity. Who wanted me to keep having these dreams of him? Were they even real?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This morning, I spent a lot of time thinking about it and decided I was going to do something to know if it was a dream or not. Tonight, when I took the poill,1already had a plan in motion to know the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the airport and were heading to the jet, I tried calling Penelope again. It was the third day and I still hadn&#39;t been able to reach her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, she&#39;d be at the Silver Citadel. She better have answers for me when we meet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was filled to the brim like the last time.Jaris and I were led in through a backdoor to the stage where the other Alphas and their Lunas sat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall thrummed with lively discussions and racket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck,&#34; I said to Jaris a moment later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He needed it. This second trial would be very difficult, according to what I heard. It was based on &#39;A King&#39;s Strength.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the name, it was for the Alphas to prove how strong they were. Thney&#39;d have to endure a very hard task for an excruciatingly long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris smiled at me, his eyes warm.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned his attention to his phone. Being the Alpha King would definitely look good on him. He had the attributes-a strict personality,wisdom,strength and dominance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and his Luna would be lucky to rule the world-whoever she&#39;d be in a year&#39;s time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank at the thought of someone else being in my place less than a year from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Zarek and his Luna were the next to arrive.I glared at him as he took his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole. I&#39;d need to have a word with him at the end of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might&#39;ve saved my life, but he was a dick who almost ruined me. How could he connive with Marta to set me up? He could&#39;ve raped me and I&#39;d have never even had an idea about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the Chairman came on stage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried calling Penelope again but she was still not reachable. I scoured my eyes through the crowd,through the spot where the Elders were sitting, yet no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, I was losing my mind. And why did I have this feeling of unease?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairman Lyon welcomed everyone to the trial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went ahead to introduce the term which we already knew was &#39;A King&#39;s Strength.&#39; He talked about the importance and impact in the trial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He called on the participating Alphas, and when Jaris stood up, I wished him more luck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could take my place, you know? I&#39;d love to see your strength,&#34; he joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found myself unable to stifle a laugh. &#34;Even if that was possible, trust me, you wouldn&#39;t see me anywhere near that place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a smile at me before walking off to join the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. Being on good terms with Jaris Dreadmoor was... exhilarating. I definitely preferred it to those times we bickered. I was terrified of that part of him. Hopefully, we wouldn&#39;t have a reason to go back to that again.</p>
