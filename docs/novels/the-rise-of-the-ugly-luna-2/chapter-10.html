                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up feeling better than I&#39;d slept the previous night. I made a mental calculation of the things l needed to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since father&#39;s union with Darkspire didn&#39;t work out,it was safe for me to return to Draconis, right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Draconis was a human country. Over there, I had a job, good human friends, and kind neighbours. It was nothing like the chaotic and violent world of the wolves, and I&#39;d very much love to return to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I concluded on telling father about it before the end of today. I&#39;ll also end my final mate bond with Roderick, then I&#39;ll be free. My life would go back to being perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was light with joy as I freshened up and decided to drive out for breakfast. Of course, there were tons of food in the house, but I felt like cruising around the Pack-one last time, at least. My father&#39;s pack wvas quite beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But just as my car turned onto the street, a ridiculously bright red car swerved right into my lane,nearly slamming into me. I had to stomp on the brakes so hard I thought I&#39;d snap my foot off.The seatbelt yanked me back, saving me from kissing the steering wheel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, who the hell was this blind oof? You&#39;ve got to be kidding me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The offending car just sat there, far too close to mine, as if daring me to lose my temper. WVell,congratulations, buddy-you won. Fury bubbling under my skin, I threw open my door and stomped over, ready to give them a piece of my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; I knocked on the tinted window. &#34;What are you doing? You almost hit me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t see who it was yet, but obviously, it had to be an arrogant, mannerless twerp. The front door finally opened, and out stepped a man in dark shades, leaning casually against the car like he&#39;d just parked in a VIP spot at the Oscars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re lucky I didn&#39;t run into you completely,&#39;cause trust me, that was my intention,&#34; he drawled in a grumpy tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? Was he kidding me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you-&#34; I paused, instantly realizing how familiar he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was somethingabout his cocky smirk and perfectly messy dark hair that struck a chord.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows, trying to recall where I&#39;d seen him. And then, like lightning, it struck me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grin that spread across his face could&#39;ve rivaled a toothpaste commercial. He pulled off his shades dramatically, tossing them onto the dashboard like he was auditioning for a rom-com. Then, in the most exaggerated announcer voice, he declared, &#34;Ding-ding-ding! Give the lady a prize! Took you long enough, Lyric. I was beginning to think your memory got fried in the crash that almost happened. Come here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could stop myself, I burst into laughter-the kind that makes your stomach hurt-and practically threw myself into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I were childhood friends, long before | got my scar. He was the one person who never shied away from me, although at some point, he became inconsistent as he was away to a new country. I was devastated when he left &#39;cause he had been the one true friend I had left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We haven&#39;t seen each other in over fifteen years.I was surprised when he could recognize me without my scar. Apparently, Rufus had taken a picture of me at the airport and had it sent to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,how have you been, Lyric? I haven&#39;t seen you in like, what, thirty years?&#34; Jace said as he locked some whipped cream off his fingers. We were in a cozy little restaurant by the window, sharing breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! I&#39;m only twenty-five.&#34; I rolled my eyes at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, fine. But you&#39;ve grown into one beautiful woman, Lyric. Like, literally,&#34; he pointed at my face,making me laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my gaze roam over him like I was just seeing him for the first time. &#34;You too, Bee. You&#39;ve grown into a fine young man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I was serious. He has really worked on his body and developed alI the abs and...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, we&#39;re adults now. Stop calling me that name.&#34;He stabbed his finger in the air toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. He&#39;d always hated that name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked about so many things, including how Roderick had used and dumped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I swear, if I ever see that slimy Alpha, I&#39;ll rearrangehis face,&#34; Jace fumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t. He&#39;s one of the most powerful Alphas now,&#34; I rolled my eyes, although my heart hurt from the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And my father&#39;s the Lycan Chairman-don&#39;t forget that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, that also was true. Jace&#39;s father had the power to declare war on a Pack. Apparently, Jace was his heir and would be taking over once his father retires.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, there was no need for a war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, have you found someone yet?&#34; I asked a while later, wanting to change the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had always had issues sustaining a relationship with a woman. It was one of the problems I worried about for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. Believe me, Lyric, I&#39;ve tried. I&#39;ve given a lot of bitches too many chances, but it&#39;s just not working out. I don&#39;t know.&#34; He shrugged. &#34;Maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;re not trying enough. You&#39;re too flirty to stay committed, Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh-uh. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried, Ly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, there was a certain interruption.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The restaurant suddenly went quiet as two men walked into the place, two men whose presence screamed power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had the build of guards with faces as hard as rocks. I recognized them in an instant. They had been with Jaris yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat. Was it a coincidence that they were walking towards our table?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Do those guys think we have an extra seat here or something?&#34; Jace asked, watching with suspicion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two men finally came to a stop before us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A warm morning to you, Ms. Harper,&#34;&#39; the first one spoke. He looked kinder than the other. deeply sorry we have to interrupt this moment, but we&#39;ll need you to come with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I know you? Jace asked, squinting up at them.&#34;Wait, are you with one of those cults that sells essential oils? Because if you are, we&#39;re gonna have to pass-our pyramid scheme plate is already full.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first man ignored him and kept his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34; | demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris seeks an audience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name affected me to my core.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow. Was he finally ready to see me? Maybe he wanted to finally accept the contract? But shouldn&#39;t they have reached out to father first?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why does he want to see me?&#34; I looked up at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll have to come with us to get an answer to that question,Ms.&#34; My hand tightened around my fork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I&#39;d already made up my mind on what I needed to do. I was going back to Draconis, back to my normal life.I was done with the people here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw tightening, I forced the words out. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,but I&#39;m not seeing him. You can tell him I&#39;ve changed my mind.&#34;</p>
