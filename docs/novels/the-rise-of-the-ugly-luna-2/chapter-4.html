                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick Fletcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The one man I&#39;d hoped would love me but never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mind was a bitch. I thought | was over Roderick&#39;s betrayal and wouldn&#39;t feel a thing when I met him.But watching him as he approached me, looking like he was the one in charge made my eyes rim with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled and looked away, forcing the tears back in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, I had to come over to speak to you myself,&#34; he leaned against the counter beside me. &#34;How daring.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat was tight, unable to find any words.I feared there would be a crack in my voice if l managed to speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three guards hovered beside him, their eyes darting around. Roderick looked sophisticated, like he&#39;d obviously been having a good life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he even doing here? Was he picking someone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s the name?&#34; He tilted his head as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, won&#39;t even look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t feel like disclosing my name to strangers,&#34;|finally managed. My voice was tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes beamed with amusement. And here was a man who never smiled at me when we were together for one year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m overly excited today,&#34; he sighed.&#34;I&#39;m here, waiting for a certain bitch to arrive.&#34; When I gave him a puzzled look,he added, &#34;Ex-mate. We are through with the first step and just have the tiny little step to go. I&#39;d finally be free of her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. He was unbelievable. &#34;I&#39;d have done this sooner, you know? But the horrid girl has been missing for years. Stressed us the hell out to find her.&#34; He spoke with raw disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you call her horrid?&#34; | found myself asking before I could stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;Trust me, honey; she&#39;s a monster.If you see her, you&#39;d have the same opinion. She&#39;s the ugliest thing I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something hot exploded in my chest. It was all I could do not to let my emotions rush out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. This was not the right place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Roderick was the true monster. He had no idea he was standing before the very woman he despised.What would proud he do if he gets to know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense why he was waiting at the airport.He clearly wanted to drag me to the temple to cut the ribbon. Well, I wouldn&#39;t let him humiliate me in public.Not again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, my luggage finally arrived. &#34;Sorry for the delay, ma&#39;am,&#34; the young man said as he rolled it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not looking at Roderick, I made to leave. That must have surprised him. &#34;I&#39;d love to speak to you some other time. Your contact, if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I stood with my back to him,contemplating my words. I turned around when I found the most polite one | could give; &#34;Even if I have to give up my number to save myself from you, l wouldn&#39;t do it. AIpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my words sank in, surprise danced in her eyes,followed by a hint of hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something blossomed in my chest. It was pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I rolled my luggage away, leaving him standing there in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rufus and I arrived home to the party. It was my stepmother&#39;s birthday party. Not that I had any intention of attending-may the moon forbid it-l just arrived at a coincidentally perfect time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t dressed for the party. Had my simple jeans and shirt on with my hair in a ponytail. Yet, when l entered the hall, heads turned in my direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt awkward for a moment. The whole attention thing was still new to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never knew I could receive so much compliments until I was free of my scar. Now, people could hardly stare at me without telling me how beautiful | was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stepsister, Nora, walked up to me with a smile.&#34;Hi! You&#39;re a little late for the party. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typical Nora. From young, she&#39;s always wanted to be friends with the hot girls. She despised me so much as I brought a &#39;stain&#39; to her name. A scarred lady being her sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years ago, she had slammed the door inh face, not letting me in despite my pleas. Now, she was being all nice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here for the party,&#34; I answered her coldly and looked away, scouring around for my father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found him in a corner with my stepmother and some guests. He was the reason I was here. I needed to know what was so urgent aside from cutting ties with Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his eyes on me, staring suspiciously.I went toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Who are you?&#34; Nora came after me, sounding a little hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I ignored her until I reached father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father was a well known Alpha, hence the party filled with dignitaries. I did well to bow my head to them as I stood before father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you?&#34; My stepmother asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met her gaze with a smirk. &#34;Am I that different that you can&#39;t recognize me?&#34; I looked to father. &#34;What about you, father? Am I too different?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Audible gasps rippled around me. Nora&#39;s hand went over her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not possible,&#34; she muttered, shaking her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; Father&#39;s eyes were filled with shock and recognition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s this impersonator?&#34; My stepmother snapped.&#34;Do you think we lack knowledge of what Lyric looks like? You think we&#39;d fall for this scam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I focused my gaze on dad. &#34;I&#39;m only here &#39;cause you said there was something important you needed to talk to me about. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like for us to have that conversation now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father took me to his study, leaving numerous shocked persons behind who couldn&#39;t utter a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t deny how good it felt to know I was the reason they were speechless. They couldn&#39;t call me ugly. As a matter of fact, I&#39;d never be called ugly by anyone, ever again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to you, Lyric? Your scar was impossible to get rid of,&#34; Father asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t wish to discuss it nowv.&#34; Or the horrible things that happened within five years. I was still trying to run from them. &#34;Just tell me why you needed me here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that,&#34; his countenance soured. &#34;You have no idea how happy I was when. I found you after searching for years. You just... vanished.&#34; He sighed.&#34;We have a problem, Lyric. Our Pack is in a deep mess with Darkspire. I-I made some mistake and lost a lot of money-a whole lot-making me indebted to Darkspire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I did not like where this was headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkspire was a generational wolf pack, known to produce only the strongest Alphas. The Alphas that always ranked first in the hierarchy system. They were avoided as much as possible as they were known to be vicious. One did not get tangled with them for any reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If word of this gets out, we&#39;d be doomed. We&#39;d go down the ranks, and coming from a pack that was used to being at the top, believe me, it is not a good thing for us. But they&#39;re willing to let it go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows. It didn&#39;t make any sense.I sensed a huge &#39;But&#39; coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But they need a Luna from this family, for just a year.&#34;</p>
