                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute, I still couldn&#39;t grasp what he was on about.What was the connection?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I find it suspicious, don&#39;t you,boss? I mean, having this image with her. I don&#39;t think a woman would carry this if it didn&#39;t belong to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, I realized that I understood what the connection was. I just didn&#39;t want to believe it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric had been pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How?&#34; The single word felt heavy on my tongue.How would Nerion even know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just as confused, boss. There&#39;s no record of her having twins anywhere. So, I don&#39;t understand where this is coming from.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something constricting squeezed my chest, making each breath feel like a struggle. Lyric had been pregnant.For who?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC The Central Pack House was a wonder. Beyond beautiful!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we arrived, I almost forgot about my predicaments as I focused on admiring the stunning place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shown to my room which was larger and more beautiful than the one we had in Darkspire. The entire place looked like a modern palace. So big and dreamy.I couldn&#39;t be more grateful that I was here to witness it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some of the people from Darkspire were already moving to the Central Pack, accommodations being made available for them. That was how it worked.Since Jaris was King, his people were free to stay in the Central Pack, or Darkspire if they wanted.Either way,both Packs were theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing both places weren&#39;t that far from each other. So, people who wanted to live here but still had things to do in Darkspire could still achieve that.1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked for Jaris as soon as I arrived but was told he was in a meeting. Maddy helped me settle in when she noticed I was easily getting tired. I wonder when would be the perfect time to tell them about the baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Maddy and I took a little break, I decided to go check on Xylon and Xyla. I hadn&#39;t really seen them since this whole thing started, and it was crazy how much I&#39;ve missed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I asked for directions and was shown to their new room.I was excited to hear from them how much they love their new home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on the door and went in when their nanny happily opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!!!&#34; I greeted enthusiastically, opening my arms wide for a hug I knew would come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first glance, I caught them playing a game on a round table. Goodness, this room was large! Large enough to have a playing ground by the corner!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They whipped their heads in my direction when they heard my voice, and I kept my smile going,waiting for them to get up. They did get up. But they didn&#39;t run to me or even crack a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unexpected sensation tumbled from my chest,resting heavy in the depths of my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly dropped my hand as I realized they didn&#39;t have any intention of coming to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced around in confusion, my eyes settling on the nanny who also seemed clueless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is-Is something wrong?&#34; I chuckled nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe this was some sort of prank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy said not to come close to you again. She said you&#39;re a witch who kills people.&#34; It was Xyla that answered,her arms crossed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An explosion within me resonated like nothing before,a duality of searing cold and burning heat,killing me.Yet, I couldn&#39;t die. I was just here, staring at the nightmare in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She-She told you that?&#34; I stuttered, my fear mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;W-Was she lying?&#34; Xylon asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy doesn&#39;t lie!&#34; Xyla defended, but her brother didn&#39;t even look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes on me as he repeated his question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see it in those silver eyes of his-the hope that it was all a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was where the problem lied. It wasn&#39;t entirely a lie. I did kill someone. I was dangerous. But how could Marta tell them such about me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m not a witch.&#34; I took two steps closer. It broke my heart to pieces when they took&lt;a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But did you kill someone?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was where I got stuck. To get out of the situation,I&#39;d have to lie to them. And how could I possibly do that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, kids. It&#39;s a long story. I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you did kill someone using your powers,&#34; Xyla cut me off, finality in her tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a witch?&#34; Xylon had this disappointment in his voice and eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, I could endure the whole world hating me; not these kids. I couldn&#39;t even explain the kind of bond I&#39;d formed with them, but it&#39;d completely kill me to know they hated me like most people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, please. Let&#39;s just forget about that,okay?It&#39;s not talk for children,&#34; I still pressed, hoping that by some cruel fate, they&#39;d have pity on me and let the matter die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was I kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We don&#39;t play with witches! Mummy said not to!&#34; She grabbed her brother&#39;s hand and took several steps back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,nanny.We don&#39;t wanna play with her.Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even try to stop the tear that slid into my cheek. The scene felt so unreal. Xylon and Xyla avoiding me?! Guess I underestimated Marta&#39;s passion to manipulate the kids into hating me this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait for the nanny to tell me. I hurried out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I reached my room, I let the dam pour,crying uncontrollable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing had ever hurt me like this. Not even when Roderick maltreated me. Not all those times when Jaris hurt me and made me cry. This feeling...this was totally different. Too painful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality started to dawn on me. While I might have been of help to a lot of people, not everyone would like me. People like Xylon and Xyla actually considered me dangerous and didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with me. How do I continue living in this situation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods. What if... What if I get to find my kids and they also become scared of me? What if this very one in my womb grows up to hate me as well? I wept for a long time, losing track of time. It wasn&#39;t until my phone started ringing that I snapped out for a moment to answer the call which was from a strange number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment I heard the voice, my day went completely worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprang to my feet, dread and disgust suddenly filling me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden.</p>
