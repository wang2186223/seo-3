                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment too long, I was frozen, not knowing how else to proceed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I should turn around and leave. What if the corpse manages to speak and expose me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it sounded stupid. But I wasn&#39;t joking when l said I wasn&#39;t thinking straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed myself forward. It was better if I knew what their thoughts were. At least, that way I&#39;d know how to proceed with myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to the entrance, I found all the people | knew in there, Jaris being at the forefront. The body was still there, a painful reminder of the life I&#39;d taken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are those marks on her wrist?&#34; Luna Isolde asked. Jaris crouched to touch it. Judging by the look on his face,he had no idea about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to some of the guards beside him. &#34;Take care of the body and find out who she was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, I couldn&#39;t express how grateful I was that there were no cameras in this part of the Pack.The guest house was hardly used.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guards nodded as Jaris walked away, coming toward the door. He paused when he noticed me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a dry gulp, praying I wasn&#39;t looking too nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What happened?&#34; | inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed as he glanced back at the body. &#34;We don&#39;t know yet. Somebody came to use the restroom and found her this way. I don&#39;t even know how she got an invite and made it here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t say anything, not even some pretentiously shocked words. My throat was too heavy. &#34;It&#39;s a good thing the kids are not here,&#34; I managed to say after a while, my gaze lowering to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a step past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; The words were out before | could catch them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped, turning back at me. &#34;What for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For being responsible for the corpse in front of you.For being a murderer. For ruining the party. For being something you hate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of saying the true words, I went for something that wasn&#39;t quite far from the truth. &#34;The party.It&#39;s ruined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shrugged. &#34;It&#39;s sad, actually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His phone rang in his pocket. When he took it out and saw the caller, his expression warped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who was calling? Did it have to do with me? Gods, I was paranoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me,&#34; he muttered and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the room, I salt-scrubbed, wanting to rid myself of the invisible blood and guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so dirty. So evil. The Executioner might have been after my life, but never did I think I was going to take someone&#39;s life so soon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, everyone was right. My kind was dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****++****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond pissed, and it was great work trying to keep my calm considering the guests present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;d spent so long planning this party. Only for it to be ruined by a strange death. Who dared to commit a murder on my kids&#39; birthday? Right now, I wanted nothing more than to strangle the life out of them, if only I could see them. I went to a less noisy place to take Elder Luca&#39;s call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could say a word, his panicked voice reached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris, you need to come over here. Right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. It was the first time Luca was sounding this way, like he had just finished fighting for his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not something I can say on the phone. I need you at the Capital, Jaris. We need to see you right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. I hated being kept in suspense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried getting some answers out of him but he wouldn&#39;t budge. So, I was forced to arrange for a quick flight to the Capital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Capital was only forty minutes away by air.I&#39;d be there in no time. But the night wasn&#39;t going as expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my beta and head of security get transportation ready while I went to check on Lyric. She didn&#39;t look fine when I saw her earlier in the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked on her door and while I waited, my mind helplessly drifted to the time I went into her room without knocking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wet hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wet legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shock in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But most importantly, the beauty of her flawless body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole image was still very clear in my head.I smiled at the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I frowned when I noticed she still hadn&#39;t opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked again. &#34;Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door slowly opened. She looked and smelt fresh, like someone that just had a bath. Her hair was wet to prove that, although she was wearing a pair of jeans and a black top.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I leaned against the doorframe, my hands tucked into my pockets. &#34;You okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated before nodding. The bridge of her nose was pink. Had she been crying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure?&#34; | cocked my head, not liking the look of this one bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;m just... I&#39;m just having some headache.I&#39;ll be fine.&#34; Her eyes were stuck on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my gaze linger on her before nodding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to fly to the Capital.&#34; There was a slight pause. &#34;Would you like to come with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes moved from the floor to my face.My heart felt the sting of a thousand thorns when I saw the sadness in her eyes. I&#39;d come to realize that seeing Lyric Harper sad was one of the sights I couldn&#39;t bear. I couldn&#39;t believe I just asked her to accompany me to the Capital. For some reason, I think it&#39;d feel good if she kept me company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; Her eyes were back on the floor. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t make it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment pressed down on my chest. 1couldn&#39;t bring myself to ask what the reason was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; I stepped back. &#34;See you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze met mine yet again, her eyes now glistening with an even deeper shade of sadness. It looked like she wanted to say something else. To change her mind,maybe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she just kept staring at me and didn&#39;t say a word until I turned around and left.</p>
