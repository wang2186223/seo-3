                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. Lyric! Wake up, sleepyhead!&#34; There was a rough tap against my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fluttered open but quickly went shut from the light that nearly blinded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open your damn eyes, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could recognize Jace&#39;s&#39; voice from anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes again and tried to adjust to the brightness in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The windows,&#34; I mumbled. &#34;Close them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. They&#39;re staying open until you get your ass out of bed. Why are you still asleep? What are you,a toddler?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand went over my forehead, feeling how hot it was. Was I running a temperature right now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My head...&#34; I moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think a party was taking place in it. &#34;Of course, that is what happens when you stay up drinking into the night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to look at Jace. He was standing at the foot of the bed, scowling at me like he was a parent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat up, dragging the duvet to my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What happened...?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What time is it?&#34; I swallowed past the lump in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;One p.m, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened like saucers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That would explain why the sun was so bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! I&#39;m supposed to be at TCH!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;m not the alcohol you drank. And if I hadn&#39;t come in now, you&#39;d still be sleeping youur ass off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scrambled out of bed, only to find my legs slightly shaky. Then, it hit me-the discomfort between my legs. &#34;What...&#34; I couldn&#39;t form any words as I lowered myself on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s brows scrunched up in concern. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, it came crashing on me-fragments of my dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was unclear, but I was very sure it was Jaris. He was here with me, in my bed,touching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered at the thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. It wasn&#39;t possible. It was the second time I was having such weird dreams of Jaris. And that was what it was.Weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today was different. Today, I could feel the discomfort in my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hand over my belly. It was almost as if I could still feel his touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; Jace held my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath. &#34;I&#39;m fine. I just... I just need to make a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know what I was going to say to my superior. I fidgeted with the neck of my dress as I stood by the window and made the call. I couldn&#39;t believe l actually slept in this dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a breath when Guinevere picked the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Hi, ma&#39;am. I am- I&#39;m so sorry. I know | was supposed to be there this morning. I was actually unwell and had to....&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tumbled out an explanation. Goodness, I felt incompetent. I&#39;d been so clumsy at work of late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Lyric. You can actually take the day off,&#34;Guinevere replied, surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,&#34; I tucked some strands of hair behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere didn&#39;t look like someone who would tell you to take the day off when you call to apologize for coming late. How was I being lucky?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thanked her and brushed my fingers through my hair when the call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; Jace asked from behind,clearly noticing my discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, I wasn&#39;t. I was so restless. Deliciously so.Something didn&#39;t feel right with me. Still,I lie as I walked into the bathroom. &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was even worse being in the bathtub. Each time l closed my eyes, I could feel his lips against mine, his hands touching me. Caressing me intimately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was even worse than the dream I had in that garden.This one felt real. Too real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A grunt left my throat when I touched my clit. It didn&#39;t feel normal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I knew it wasn&#39;t possible. Nobody would dare touch me in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although...how did I even end up in my bedroom last night? Who helped me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was no longer in the room when I returned.I looked for something simple to wear and was brushing my hair in the mirror when my eyes fell on the mark on my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, my brush falling from my hand to the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved my hair aside to have an unrestricted view.There was a red mark on my neck, like teeth had sunk into it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dread pooled in my stomach. I might not be mistaken. Someone might&#39;ve truly been here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shaky fingers, I tied my hair and stormed out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in the bar in no time, standing in front of the bartender who had become friendly with me. He&#39;d been showing he a lot of respect since I became Luna,and coupled with the fact that he was a nice guy, it wasn&#39;t difficult becoming semi-friends with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know I passed out in myseat. Who took me?&#34; My voice was raw with impatience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender looked hesitant before releasing the name. &#34;Kael. I&#39;m sure the Alpha must have ordered him to do so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat tightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael took me to my room. And right after, I was touched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Kael wouldn&#39;t do this to me. He didn&#39;t strike me like the kind of man...right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked for him and met him in the gym. Of course,he was a gym lover. It was how he had so many muscles and a finely-tuned body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his head when I stood beside him. But I wasn&#39;t there for pleasantries. &#34;I was told it was you who helped me from the bar.What happened when you took me to my room?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to spell the question out to him.I understood how overwhelming it could be when someone gets accused of something they&#39;re not guilty of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He furrowed his brows, seeming surprised. &#34;Nothing.I laid you in bed and left. And nobody went into your room,either.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded honest. Kael was an honest man. I didn&#39;t even know why I suspected him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It just didn&#39;t feel right. Or was this mark on my neck merely a coincidence? Were the memories of someone touching me only a coincidence? Was it normal to have such vivid sex dreams?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, as I bathed for work,something strange happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I did something I never thought I&#39;d do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head was thrown back against the tub, my eyes closed as my fingers traveled to my core. My weird dream from the other night filled my head,sending shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was touched. In a good way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And not just by anyone but Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was him. His smell was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still hear his voice in my head from the one time he moaned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smell was intoxicating and delicious. His broad body on mine felt so good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when he touched me,right where I was touching myself,it was the best feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fastened my pace, rubbing my clit to the memory of my dream. My mouth fell open as I struggled to breathe. I came at the same time I did in my dream,and a scream filled the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy smokes!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted when I climbed down from my high.I couldn&#39;t even lift a finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t make any sense. How could I come to the mere memory of this dream. Of something that wasn&#39;t real. But as I brushed my hair in front of the mirror, my fingers grazed the fading mark on my neck. The one thing that felt real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were sad in the mirror as I reminded myself it wasn&#39;t possible. Jaris hated me and would never touch me this way. I was clearly the one with issues who wouldn&#39;t stop dreaming of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with me?</p>
