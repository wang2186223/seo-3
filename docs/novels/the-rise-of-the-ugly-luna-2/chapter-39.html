                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For two days, I avoided Jaris like a plaque. And I think he was doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know we&#39;ve both been intimate before. But that was five years ago! When I was a very different person,right before he abandoned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This body is very special now. He couldn&#39;t just look at it when he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, aunty,&#34; Xylon said with a sweet smile as I massaged his sister&#39;s scalp on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For what,honey?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The mating ceremony tomorrow. We know you&#39;ll become daddy&#39;s Luna,&#34; Xyla answered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Actually, I&#39;d been quite nervous about that. Jaris and I would finally be mated tomorrow, only to be broken apart after a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was still more concerned about the fact we were only going to be together for a year. While it&#39;d help my father clear his debts, I still didn&#39;t understand what Jaris would be getting out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door. It was the children&#39;s nanny, followed by Jaris who stood before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got goosebumps instantly, my throat running dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... we&#39;ll continue our session later, dear,&#34; Isaid sweetly to Xyla as I lifted her head off my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye,aunty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made for the door, and my heart skipped a beat as I got closer to Jaris. I dipped my head, but I could feel his eyes on me. As soon as I had gone past him, I hastened my steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was relieved when I got to the room, but that relief was short-lived as a while later, Kael came over to inform me that Jaris was calling for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paced restlessly in my room, trying to come up with the best way to avoid him. I took too long, and when l heard a knock on my door, I was startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling for courage, I went ahead to open the door. My breath lunged in my throat when I came face to face with the devil, in this case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed around the lump in my throat. &#34;Good evening, Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knocked.&#34; He slipped one hand into his pocket. &#34;I hope you noticed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I wasn&#39;t so nervous, perhaps I&#39;d have scoffed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I sent for you thirty minutes ago. I thought I&#39;d find you busier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt reprimanded. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. I was just about to be on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; His eyes raked over me. &#34;Doesn&#39;t look like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh.What was he doing here? I wanted the ground to open and swallow me whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, I stopped by to know how preparations for tomorrow&#39;s going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. Jaris stopped by to check on me? What a surprise in this peculiar domain!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s... It&#39;s going just fine. My friend will actually be coming over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to give it some thought. Well, he should know by now that Jace was no threat. He was my bestfriend; that&#39;s all. Plus, I didn&#39;t have any female friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If he&#39;ll be helpful,&#34; he shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart just got lighter. Hm. Why was Jaris Dreadmoor being so sweet today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take care, then.&#34; He tipped his head and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to my room, feeling on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would it be wrong to tell Jaris I was the lady from five years ago? What if he&#39;d been looking for me,considering the fact that he had my picture with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was damn nervous. But a part of me was pushed to actually do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone came awake on the bed. When I checked, it turned out to be a strange caller.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34; I answered it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.It&#39;s Marta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. My head slumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on, Marta!? Why in the moon would Marta be calling me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi. Is there a problem?&#34; I tucked some strands of hair behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That depends. I need us to meet up. Right now. It&#39;s kind of important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than an hour, I met up with Marta at the garden she requested. The corner where we sat was private with just the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you call for me?&#34; I asked as I watched the waiter open our drinks on the table and poured it into two glasses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta looked worried. It was a rare sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just worried about my kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>O...kay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The waiter left, and she picked up her glass from where she took a sip. Done, he carefully placed it back on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t really know who you are. And it&#39;s the first time that Jaris is entrusting someone to this extent with Xylon&#39;s health. What makes you think you can actually heal him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t ask the question like it was one of her usual word-battles. She asked it like she was truly concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. That was a first, coming from someone like Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I won&#39;t call myself perfect. No one&#39;s perfect. But I do think I possess certain knowledge on medicine.I mean well for Xylon. I mean, he&#39;s just a little boy who doesn&#39;t deserve to go through that amount of pain. All I want to do is help him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drank from her glass again. &#34;But how do you happen to possess such knowledge? Where did you study?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared down at the table.&#34;It&#39;s.... It&#39;s a long story. Let&#39;s jst let go of the story.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She drank from her glass again. I noticed I hadn&#39;t even drank from mine yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for my own glass and took a sip. Hm. Now I understand why Marta couldn&#39;t stop drinking from hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to be a careful mother, Lyric. Initially, a part of me had thought you were pretending to care for my son so you could please Jaris. I was even worried that you might have an ulterior motif. That is the reason you see me being harsh each time I seeyou near the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled. &#34;They&#39;re poor kids. I could never do anything to hurt them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta nodded. She was about sipping from her glass again when her hand shook and the crimson wine spilled on her dress. Oh, damn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. Sorry about that,&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dress was ruined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clumsy me!&#34; She hissed, dabbing it with the back of her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rose to her feet. &#34;I need to take care of this. I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her leave, heading to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. Who could&#39;ve thought she could be this nice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, it was Jaris being nice to me. Now, it was Marta. Looks like Selene is finally on my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled and tried to drink from my glass again, only to realize it was empty. What!? How did I finish this without knowing!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too good. I&#39;d probably ask for the name before I left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt tired. Of course, I should be. I&#39;d been working tirelessly for the past two days because of the ceremony tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mating ceremony with Jaris Dreadmoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile touched my lips as I relaxed my head on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d be getting mated to him tomorrow. My Jaris.My love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled. Images of him filled my head instantly; images from years ago. He gave me the best night of my life. And now, there was a possibility we could have more of such nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad idea to be mated to Jaris, even if it was for a year.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, something strange was happening to me. I wanted him. Only Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; I heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? Jaris was here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting my head, I saw him standing in front of me, looking dashing in a black suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; My head was lightweight, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and extended his hand to me, and I took it. He was real. Jaris was here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every other thing around him was blurry in my sight. The only image I could clearly see was his. But it didn&#39;t matter. The only person I wanted to see was him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to get you.Come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pulled me to my feet and started leading me toward the back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh! My head felt so heavy. Where was he even taking me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to ask. I trusted Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued walking until we reached a room, just behind where Marta and I had been sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. I had no idea there was a room here. It even had a bed in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris pushed me to the wall, his hands on my waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the moon, he was so hot. He could be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a burning desire inside me. I couldn&#39;t think, I just acted. I put my arms around him and kissed him first, kissing him like an insane woman who had been starving for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with my head on the table. My neck and waist hurt. My head felt like a party had happened in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned as I sat up. What a heck of a dream I just had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. Why was I so aroused for Jaris? So aroused to the point that I&#39;d slept with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched my lips. The dream had felt real. Glancing behind me, I found the room.Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up and approached it, but it was locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed. Of course, it was locked. It was all a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stupid dream at that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And we ended up not even getting intimate in the dream. I&#39;d been about to undress when he suddenly stopped me. That was all I could remember before I woke up from the &#39;nightmare&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Returning to the table, I noticed that Marta&#39;s bag was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? Why would she leave me here alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scowled as I took my bag and also left.</p>
