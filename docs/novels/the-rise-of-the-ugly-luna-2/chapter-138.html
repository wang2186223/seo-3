                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I could never be a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t put a name to what we had between us of recent, but I was sure it could never go beyond this.We could never have real feelings for each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I shut the door after his departure, I slid to the floor and wept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt that maybe; just maybe my life would&#39;ve been different if I wasn&#39;t &#39;this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps, I&#39;d have been able to accompany him to the Capital and even get to know what the problem was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have kept him company while he navigated whatever challenges he was going to deal with. Maybe we would&#39;ve cracked a joke or two and shared a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, just maybe, we&#39;d have even held hands at some point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But none of it could be real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a dangerous forbidden thing; a murderer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to be far from him and everyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face as I got on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My handbag was already set. Since the place was still full and busy, I didn&#39;t want to risk moving around with luggages to avoid drawing attention. So, I only took my essentials and fitted them into my big hand bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later and I was out of my room. I was sure Jaris must&#39;ve left already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even say goodbye to the kids, and I hated myself for it. I couldn&#39;t face them; not with what I&#39;d just done. I got into my car and hit the road, the tears flowing as I controlled the steering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know where exactly to go. But my major plan was finding somewhere else to spend the night.Then by morning, I&#39;d book a flight to a different country.A human one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe I&#39;d be lucky and the Executioners won&#39;t come to find me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t tell Jace about it. No. This was my cross.He didn&#39;t deserve to get pulled down with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already out of Darkspire territory when a call came in from a strange number. I picked the call and the voice that reached me made my heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric! It&#39;s me... It&#39;s Penelope!&#34; She sounded like she was being chased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly moved to the side of the road, bringing the car to a stop. &#34;Penelope? What&#39;s the problem? Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t-I can&#39;t-&#34; She grunted, as if she just tripped and fell on something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a gunshot, followed by her shriek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes rounded as panic overtook me. What the hell was happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have to listen to me,&#34; It sounded like she was running again. But her voice was strained and weaker.What if she had been hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your kids... they&#39;re alive. They are-&#34; another gunshot and the line went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So did my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t blink. Despite knowing the call had ended,I held the phone in my hand, staring at the blank screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Your kids. They are alive.&#39; My heart pulsed with an uneven tempo, climbing up to my throat as if trying to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life surged back to me as I blinked and took in the words. My hands shook as I dialed the number, but it wouldn&#39;t connect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no, no. Please, no,&#34; I muttered like an insane woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was she? Who was chasing her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a raucous breath echoing within the car.lt took me some time to realize it was coming from me.I was hyperventilating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,it got worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw the headlights coming from behind. But l thought it must be a normal vehicle and didn&#39;t give any thought to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, it kept getting closer and closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With how clogged my mind was, I realized a little too late what the intention was. The scream escaped me before the van crashed into me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My car was violently thrust forward, the tires skidding before it tipped onto its side, flipping over like a turtle helplessly struggling. Inside, I was thrown against the seatbelt, my body slamming against the interior as chaos erupted around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the Moon, please. It can&#39;t be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears were ringing painfully, my head constantly banging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t hear a thing or tell what was happening around me. I didn&#39;t even realize when my door was pulled open until I felt a pair of hands dragging me roughly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I groaned and whimpered from how sore my body was. I knew I was bleeding. I just couldn&#39;t tell where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard someone sobbing beside me. No. It was me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sobbing so hard, my shoulders quaked. But for what exactly, I couldn&#39;t tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did it have to do with the murder at the party? Or the fact that I was about to die?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or the fact that I just learned from Penelope that my kids were alive? Or what was that? Was it alie? A trick?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was dying anyway. I was never found to find out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Consciousness was slipping out of me. I felt my eyes going close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, stay awake.&#34; Someone slapped my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to open my eyes just as I heard light footsteps. The man who had slapped me stood up as the new person took his place, crouching before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t see his face due to how blurry my vision was, but I could tell he was smiling down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper.&#34; His hand reached out, touching my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice...there was something familiar about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It all became clear when he added, &#34;My brother&#39;s mate.&#34;</p>
