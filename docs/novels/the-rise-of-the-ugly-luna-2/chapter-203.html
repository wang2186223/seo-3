                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day did come. Despite how much I wished it wouldn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris held my hand as he walked me into the huge hall which was normally used for the trials. It wasn&#39;t just the Council that were gathered; he had summoned other Wolves as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he wasn&#39;t holding my hand right now, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d have kept going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people mumbled as we climbed onto the stage.Every single person I knew was there, including the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my head down the whole time, too afraid to meet their judgy eyes. I still didn&#39;t know what Jaris&#39; plan was. But I trusted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took the stage. Everyone bowed their heads and chorused his new title.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you all for coming,&#34; his voice was firm as he spoke. &#34;I had to do this today because, it&#39;s a topic that is beyond important to me. It involves the woman I love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall went dead silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And also, the woman carrying my child.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence was shattered in a split second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth dropped open in shock, same time the crowd started mumbling and looking at each other.What was he doing?! He didn&#39;t tell me he was going to reveal that!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris waited for the noise to die down before he continued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Recently, as you all know already, we discovered she was a Siphon-something that has always been forbidden and executed. Before now, I also hated the Siphons and was glad they were in extinction.&#34; He scoffed. &#34;If you heard my story, you&#39;d understand |have more reasons to hate them than you do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I met with this woman under unpleasant circumstances,&#34; he stretched his hand toward me.&#34;I didn&#39;t like her at first, just like I hardly ever liked anyone. But that was before I got to understand how much of an amazing woman she was. Lyric Harper has been more than a blessing to my life. She&#39;s my everything, and honestly, I can&#39;t imagine myself living without her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, I am being biased. The right thing to do would be to hand her to the Executioners.&#34; He paused for emphasis. &#34;But how can I not be biased when it has to do with this very woman? HHow can l... simply hand her over like she hasn&#39;t been the sweetest soul l know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at me with soft loving eyes before looking back at the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Some of you here have met Lyric, and I&#39;d like to know if there&#39;s any of you that&#39;s had a bad experience with her. Why do we have to execute our &#39;own&#39; simply because they&#39;re something they did not choose to be? Who the hell set these laws?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low buzz of the crowd heightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We have worse wolves amongst us. Most of us here have done despicable things-things we have somehow managed to get away with. Yet, Lyric who has been nothing but sweet to the people around her should be the one executed? Because she possesses powers that could do more good than harm? Or because her forefathers in the past did something despicable? So, Lyric who didn&#39;t even know what happened should suffer for it? And you all-&#34; he laughed.&#34;-expect me to be cool with that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look like an ideal King right now. Nothing like a King who would speak calmly and sweetly to his subjects. He looked every bit of what people knew him to be-dark, cold, uncaring about the right thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To prove my point, I have brought over some witnesses to testify on their encounter with Lyric.&#34; He stepped aside, looking at the backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also watched curiously, wondering what people he was referring to. Until I saw a couple of people emerging from the backstage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth dropped open as a loud gasp escaped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mr. Owens, Mr. Pete, so many other patients I healed at TCH, my friends-Juan, Beck-some of my colleagues from work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? How did Jaris know about them and even find them?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise from the crowd grew as the people took the stage. They bowed at me before facing the crowd,</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was beating too fast, tears gathering behind my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One after the other, they spoke of how I&#39;d helped them get better within minutes; taken their pain away when the other doctors had been unable to. Some mentioned how their cases had been terminal,yet l gave them a second chance at life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nina, Owen&#39;s granddaughter who had been pregnant when I healed her grandfather, also came on stage with her little baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t think my grandfather was going to see this baby,&#34; she said. &#34;I remember crying every hour of the day, praying to the Moon to give him a second chance at life. The Moon goddess did answer my prayers by sending this woman to me. If it wasn&#39;t for her, my grandfather wouldn&#39;t have been here right now. My baby wouldn&#39;t receive the love she&#39;s been getting from him. How do we execute someone like her just because the law has been existing for centuries? I mean, while there are wolves out there killing, she&#39;s been saving lives. She&#39;s done more good than harm, and my family will be forever indebted to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctor Guinevere also came forward to give her speech. She talked about her grandmother&#39;s sister being a Siphon and executed for it. &#34;Her death had broken a lot of things in the family.Imagine losing your loved one when they haven&#39;t even done anything, simply because they&#39;re Siphons.I&#39;ve worked in the health sector long enough to know that Lyric had done things no one had been able to do. If we had more of her kind in the heath sector,we&#39;d have a very decreased death rate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some colleagues spoke about me. &#34;She&#39;s been an amazing person,&#34; Evans said. &#34;Sweet, fun to work with. There are more dangerous wolves amongst uS than her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; was also very scared of Siphons before now,&#34; a female colleague said. &#34;But getting to know Lyric is one of them, I can&#39;t help but believe we&#39;ve been lied to our whole lives. Not all Siphons are evil. They definitely deserve a chance to live as they didn&#39;t ask to be born with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace also talked about it, how I have been his best friend from childhood and not even once had I hurt him except for the one time I hit him with a spoon.That had gotten some laughter from the people. My cheeks had become a canvas for tears as almost everyone I knew talked about me, giving their good remarks. I always thought I didn&#39;t have friends;always felt like I had more acquaintances than friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But today changed everything. You don&#39;t have to be friends with someone to like them. What did I do to deserve such love?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris took the stage again when everyone was done talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd had gone calm, the people whispering amongst themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With this said,&#34; Jaris began. &#34;I&#39;d like to start the motion to banish the law against the Executioners.I might be King, but this is still our world. Hence, I&#39;ll be leaving the floor open to every one of you to cast your votes. If you are in support of banishing the law or making it remain standing, feel free to let us know in your votes. But I believe you all should know where I stand. If the law is to remain, you&#39;ll have to find a new King, because I&#39;ll never be the one to hand her</p>
