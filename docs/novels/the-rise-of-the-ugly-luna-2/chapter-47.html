                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going with Marta,&#34; I supplied when she was done,returning my attention to the files in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must be surprised because she was speechless for some time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t care. I just continued ticking and writing on my files.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O... Okay,&#34; she said at last, clearing her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for a moment longer, she stood there, as if waiting for me to say something else. But I didn&#39;t even look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As usual, that stupid pull was imploring me to take a look and say something, but I won over it. I didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And shortly after, she opened the door and left</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>pain knifed me in the chest as I watched Jaris and Marta go into their waiting car, leaving for the party. Marta was wearing a long blue dress, looking so beautiful. For a moment there, I wondered if she was prettier than me. Maybe that was the reason Jaris preferred her company to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I still ugly in somne way? Do l embarrass him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision soon became blurry with the tears that filled my eyes, and when their car drove out of the gate,the tears fell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drew the curtains and turned around. Standing before the mirror, I wiped my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was it. I was done allowing myself to get hurt.I made a promise to myself three years ago that I&#39;d never let anyone hurt me again. I didn&#39;t know what Jaris&#39; problem was, but I was tired of being wounded by him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the reasons I hated taking Marta as my plus-one to parties was as a result of how clingy she could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her arm wrapped around mine, wearing her big stage smile as we walked into the party. As expected, it was filled with important guests. AndI didn&#39;t miss the pause in the atmosphere when they laid eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris!&#34; The celebrant-Rhys-called as he came toward me with a wide grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped me on the shoulder. &#34;I&#39;m glad you made it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t have a choice. Happy birthday, Rhys.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed to my response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,since I was aiming for the Alpha King&#39;s Throne,I needed to do well with public functions andproving to the other Alphas that I could be there for them. It was a shitty demand, but a necessary one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, Rhys was the closest thing I had to a friend.We&#39;ve known each other since childhood, went to the same school and all. He likes to brag about the fact that we&#39;re close, but I wouldn&#39;t really say I had any friends. I grew used to people avoiding me and shut my heart to those who truly wanted to be close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta.&#34; He nodded at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Rhys. Happy birthday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.Forget about the birthday. I just needed a reason to spend money.&#34; He shrugged while Marta laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys glanced behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t come with...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you&#39;re not blind. I didn&#39;t.&#34; I snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. It&#39;s been less than a week and things are already this bad between you two? What happened, anyway?I heard you showed up quite late to the mating ceremony. A lot of guests had already left, thinking you wouldn&#39;t come.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him. &#34;Are we here for your party or mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A waiter stopped by, placing two glasses of wine on the table before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys left to attend to other guests. But well, I didn&#39;t need to go to the guests. They came to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One good thing about gaining power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>About an hour later, Rhys returned to my side, bringing up side talks about Packs and Alphas at war.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t that... your mate?&#34; He suddenly asked mid-sentence, looking at the door. I turned along with everyone and found Lyric making her way in. I frowned. She came alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn, she looks gorgeous, Jar.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My balls tightened at the realization. She did look gorgeous.Her dress was stunning and her face was..well,always pretty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought unnerved me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the place like a boss, radiating a certain kind of confidence that commanded attention and turned heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t look intimidated that she was entering such a place alone. Usually, Rhys&#39; party was strictly by invitation. But the men at the gates must have let her through when they realized she was my mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest,&#34; Rhys leaned in. &#34;I&#39;d have preferred someone like her standing by my side over Marta.&#34; He lifted his hands. &#34;Just saying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was no longer by my side, having gone to meet up with some friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give a response to that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I didn&#39;t want to, I kept my eyes on Lyric as she made her way to the counter and ordered a drink.I wasn&#39;t the only one staring nonstop at her.Every man in the room was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be dancing soon,&#34; Rhys said. &#34;I&#39;d like to dance with her if you don&#39;t mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever,&#34; I mumbled, emptying the last content of my glass into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. You don&#39;t mind? Thanks, man.&#34; He clapped me on the shoulder and took some steps forward</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll break your bones if you go to her.&#34; I reached for another glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking and laughed. &#34;And here I was,thinking you didn&#39;t care. Well, you better go ask her to the dance, then. This place is filled with men who wouldn&#39;t want a pretty lady like her dancing alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fucking no.I couldn&#39;t lay my hands on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhys winked at me and left.</p>
