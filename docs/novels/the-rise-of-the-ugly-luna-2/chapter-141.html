                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! Please, just stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t take anymore. I had been cut all over. The pain was excruciating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his bloody knuckles, and I wanted to puke knowing it was my blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you doing this?&#34; I sobbed. &#34;How can you... How can you do this to someone?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth formed a sarcastic smile. &#34;No hard feelings, love. I&#39;m merely trying to mark you.&#34; His claw came to my throat again, cutting a fresh line across it. &#34;I need my brother to see the proof that you and I were together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>II could hardly make out his voice amidst the shrill scream that escaped me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long after he released my throat, I continued wailing. It hurt. All over. I was afraid I would die soon if he kept up with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monster kept staring at me, waiting patiently for me to stop screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Initially, I&#39;d been conflicted between taking you or the kids,&#34; he spoke again when I stopped screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My wet eyes rounded in disbelief. &#34;But then, I decided it&#39;d be more fun having you around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This guy was sick! He wanted to harm the kids? What was wrong with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Jaris was right for locking him up. A lunatic like him didn&#39;t deserve to be amongst us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, my brother and I weren&#39;t always like this,&#34; he leaned back in his seat. &#34;Growing up, our bond was quite strong. Until he felt the need to betray me. I bet it was because he wanted to take my place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wouldn&#39;t blame him for betraying you. A monster like you deserved worse than betrayal. But I didn&#39;t tell him that. I was too bruised to provoke more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you knew the things he&#39;s done to me, Lyric,&#34;his hand slid across my exposed thigh. I recoiled and again tried to pull my leg away, but he wouldn&#39;t let me.&#34;1fyou knew how dark his mind was...&#34; he moved his hand upward,going too close to my intimate area.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;...you&#39;d understand why I detest him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped a few inches from my intimate area. I shivered and whimpered, more tears streaking my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was defenseless against this man. Right now, he could force himself on me and there wouldn&#39;t be a thing I&#39;d be able to do about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I prayed silently to the gods above. I could accept anything, but not being raped by a man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My torn jeans were still covering my intimate area, but there were rips all over my thighs where his claws had scratched me. And even if he wasn&#39;t touching my bare skin, I hated how close his hand was. Plus, he could easily rip it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, has he been in here?&#34; He asked with a playful glint. &#34;What did it feel like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered, willing his hand to go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His other hand lifted in the air and came across my face, hitting me hard my head reeled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh sobs broke free, my body already pushed past its limits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clicked his tongue. &#34;You must&#39;ve been a terrible student.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I quivered, replying to his question. &#34;We-We haven&#39;t.&#34; Except in my dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; He seemed disappointed. &#34;So, you mean my brother has been ignoring a good meal?&#34; He tilted his head back, as if observing my full form. &#34;You sure look like a good meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1 couldn&#39;t meet his gaze anymore. Mine was too teary anyway. &#34;Please, let me go.Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him chuckle. Next was his finger coming to my cheek, caressingly. &#34;I will. When I&#39;m done with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, going to the table in the corner of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lifted my head to look at him and realized my sight was getting limited. Oh, gods; my eye must be getting swollen already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris and I used to love this drink,&#34; he said as he returned to me with a glass of wine which he drank from.&#34;There were nights we&#39;d spend hours drinking and laughing over the day&#39;s activities. There were good times between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled as he took his seat and drank some more fromn the glass. &#34;You know, back then, you couldn&#39;t be friends with one of us without being a friend to another. And an enemy of one was an enemy of the other.Our bond...&#34; he tsked. &#34;It was unbreakable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to picture him being reasonable enough to be on good terms with Jaris. So, what went wrong between them, enough for Jaris to imprison him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know, there were times we even used to share our women.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gut clenched in astonishment,, but I couldn&#39;t show it on my face as it was already scrunched in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah,there were many of them.&#34; He laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered at how alike his laughter was with Jaris&#39;. The two brothers had a lot of similarities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you know, it was quite easy since most of the ladies fell for us both. We became quite popular with it,it became every woman&#39;s dream to have a threesome with us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was insane.How had they been that close?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he and I would&#39;ve had a threesome with you if we were still in good terms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made me repulsive. He was sick in the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what in Hades went wrong with the two of them? Well, I&#39;m sure Jaris wouldn&#39;t imprison him for no reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head hung downward, consciousness slipping away. I didn&#39;t know how much longer I could hold on with all the blood I was losing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; Caden tapped me lightly on the cheek. &#34;I still need you awake.&#34; He stood up. &#34;This is the fun part.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought to keep my eyes open and watched him as he walked to the table. He returned shortly with a phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just any phone.Mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t we give sweet Jaris a call?&#34;</p>
