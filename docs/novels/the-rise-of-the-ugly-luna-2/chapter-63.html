                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had an early day at the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before leaving, I decided to check on the kids.I&#39;d returned very late last night and couldn&#39;t see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching their door, I heard her voice. I slowed my steps,her voice bringing me the usual discomfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing and hearing her was the constant reminder of what she does to my body. It was something I hated and wished I could get rid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened the doors and as soon as my presence was seen,she stopped talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been sitting on the edge of the bed, applying something on Xylon&#39;s chest and massaging. She&#39;s always been quite good with the kids. Which was why it puzzled me that she had plans of leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;I know you might not believe it, but Xylon is the reason you caught me in the first place. And I intend to stay and finish my job on him. I chuckled. I can&#39;t abandon a soul like that. Never.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words from two days stuck with me. Could there be any truth to that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy!&#34; Xyla ran to me, hugging me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon looked like he&#39;d have the done same had Lyric not been holding him on the bed. But he smiled and waved at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was youur night?&#34; I tousled Xyla&#39;s hair and went close to do the same to Xylon&#39;s. This brought me uncomfortably close to Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed her lick her lips before she said, &#34;Good morning,Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply gave her a curt nod before returning my gaze to Xyla who started talking. &#34;You came home late,dad.Xylon and I waited to see you, but you didn&#39;t show up until we fell asleep in your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fell asleep in my room. For some reason, I found that cute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, pumpkin. I had to take care of certain things.Are you done with your list?&#34; I asked them to make an unlimited list of what they wanted for their birthdays.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. Aunty Lyric is helping us with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at Lyric, our eyes locking for the briefest moments before she quickly looked away, like there was fire in mine. I&#39;ve noticed the kids were freer with Lyric than they were with their mother. It was surprising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood up, grabbing her things along. She gave a rare soft smile to Xylon as she helped himn sit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Remember to take the meds when you get home from school, ok&lt;ay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded happily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bye, Xyla.&#34; She tousled Xyla&#39;s hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she do that? Be so sweet to the kids, I mean.She often gave them smiles she didn&#39;t give to just anyone. And in return, the kids were sweet with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile dropped when she faced me. Dipping her head,she headed for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was aware she&#39;d almost passed out in the surgical ward yesterday. The sane me would&#39;ve asked if she was alright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t care. It&#39;d be insane to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,I let her leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>GUINEVERE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Arriving TCH that morning, Guinevere was headed to the President&#39;s office when Nina, Owen&#39;s granddaughter, ran to her with tear-filled eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Guinevere was scared, thinking something had happened to the man. But then she noticed the pregnant girl smiling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, thank you. Thank you so much, Guinevere.You don&#39;t know what this means to us,&#34; Nina said as she pulled her into a hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was taken by surprise. Her hands on both sides of the girl&#39;s shoulders, she pulled her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about, Kinky? I don&#39;t think l follow.&#34;She always called the girl her pet name from when she was a kid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking about grandpa! He&#39;s fine! The surgery was performed on him last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere felt like she&#39;d just been told that the sun was pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That shouldn&#39;t be possible. Mr. Owens wasn&#39;t scheduled for surgery until that morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed Nina to his room and was shocked to see that it was true. The man was indeed better and laughing like he didn&#39;t have a care in the world.He was even happy to see Guinevere. She asked him some questions concerning his surgery, but he told her he had been asleep and didn&#39;t know anything of the doctor that had saved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Guinevere left his room, she went straight for the tech room. It was delightful that Owens was okay now, but it was shocking that a doctor would operate on the man without informing anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gained access to the cameras from the tech guys and watched the footage with surprise. She saw someone go into Owen&#39;s ward at night. Someone she knew quite right but didn&#39;t expect would do something like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta and Lyric arrived TCH the same time. Although,they kept a good distance between them and didn&#39;t communicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on the ground floor, walking toward the elevator when Guinevere approached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped in front of Marta. &#34;Doctor Monroe. I need you in my office.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was strict this morning. Marta followed her to the office and took a seat when she told her to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to explain what you did?&#34; Guinevere clasped her hands on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rose her brows. &#34;Sorry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking about Mr. Owen. You performed the surgery on him!&#34; She scoffed. &#34;It was meant to be performed this morning by a team of doctors. How did you do it on your own?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta lowered her eyes to her legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, that&#39;s incredible. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re able to pull this off. I&#39;m just surprised you didn&#39;t tell anyone about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I know. I guess I didn&#39;t want to bother the rest of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere went on, telling her about how pleased she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, ma&#39;am. But could we keep this between us for now? I wouldn&#39;t want the others to know I can perform this surgery on my own.&#34; She requested.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere furrowed her brows in surprise. &#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you know how it is. I&#39;m still trying to get better with the lone surgeries.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to understand Lyric first. Wanted to know how she&#39;s able to do the things she does all by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. I understand.&#34; Guinevere nodded. &#34;But good job,Marta. Please keep it up.&#34;</p>
