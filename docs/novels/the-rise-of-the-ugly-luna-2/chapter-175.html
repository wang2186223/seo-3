                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He resumed his descent down my throat,pushing until he hit the back of my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears rushed up to my eyes, making it difficult to keep them open. But I couldn&#39;t disobey Jaris. So, I kept looking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as his face twisted with pleasure. He didn&#39;t stop until my nose was pressing against his public bone and I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands flew to his waist, trying to push him off.Then, I got to understand the purpose of his hand in my hair,because he held it firmly, making it impossible for me to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it became unbearable, he finally pulled me back with the hair, giving me some space to breathe again.The oxygen suddenly felt like a privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spittle and semen dripped from my lips. Jaris&#39; finger came beneath my chin, forcing my head up so l could look into his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look gorgeous.&#34; His words sent more heat pooling between my legs. What was he doing to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped his cock against my lips. I became scared he was going to deprive me of oxygen again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I opened my mouth, he only guided himself onto the tip of my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This shouldn&#39;t be new to you,&#34; he said sweetly. I understood he wanted me to suck him myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was wrong. It was new to me. I&#39;d never done this to any man other than him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wrapped my hand around his shaft before taking him deeper into my mouth. I tried to do the best I could,hoping I wouldn&#39;t make it obvious I was a novice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped when he pulled me back by the hair. His eyes held amusement as they looked down at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this your first time?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shame burned hot in my chest, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. I must&#39;ve made it that obvious, didn&#39;tl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped to the floor, unable to provide him with my shameful answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper,&#34; his voice danced with a trace of laughter. &#34;You haven&#39;t done this with anyone else but me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard him chuckle before his finger came beneath my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, you&#39;d willingly do it with me.&#34; A trace of gratitude warmed his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Releasing my chin, he guided himself into my mouth again and let me do what I could. He added a few tips here and there, telling me how to use my tongue,suck my cheeks in, and hold my breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt more like tutoring, but I&#39;d prefer doing this with him a million times than with anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He came all over my chest and fucked me right after.I was so exhausted by the time we finished that all I wanted was to eat and sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up hours later to an empty spot beside me.Jaris was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A profound sense of letdown wrapped around me like a shroud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked my phone to find an email from the HR of TCH, informing me that my appeal to skip work for today had been approved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This shouldn&#39;t be normal. I hadn&#39;t reported to work for a week now, yet nobody seemed to have an issue with it. Jaris&#39; handwriting was written all over this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called the kitchen to order something to eat.We actually showered and ate before we slept off, yet here I was, still feeling as hungry as a lion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While my food was getting ready, I went ahead to check on Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was working on his laptop and didn&#39;t have his usual cheerful face on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, you finally up,&#34; his fingers moved deftly across the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you...come to my room before now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup. And almost got punched in the face by Jaris for wanting to wake you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in surprise. How was I that deep asleep?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry about that.&#34; I itched the back of my nape.&#34;How&#39;s everything going?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| checked on Penelope this morning. Still no luck from that side.&#34; Almost enough to ruin my mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A brief silence settled between us. This was so not Jace. He was trying so hard to act normal, but someone like me could easily tell it was a facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did you do it, Jace?&#34; I took a seat, my voice caring enough to get him to take a break from his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael is a nice man. Why did you have to hurt him that way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He buried his face in his palms, exhaling deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;re a nice guy, Jace. You don&#39;t use people and you don&#39;t say things you don&#39;t mean. I-I thought you really liked this guy. I actually liked seeing you two together. So,what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Lyric! I-I never wanted to ruin things between us. The truth is-&#34; another deep breath. &#34;This is actually new to me. There was a reason I met with that girl the other day. Now, it might sound stupid,but it was the only way I could handle things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed attentive as he explained everything to me.He changed my view completely and made me understand why he did what he did. In the end, I couldn&#39;t help feeling bad for him. You should explain things to him, then.&#34; | suggested when he finished with his narration. &#34;He needs to know all of this. I&#39;m sure he&#39;d understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;He&#39;s beyond mad at me.Won&#39;t even look at me anymore. It&#39;s like... It&#39;s like l don&#39;t even exist.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, he has every reason to be mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll listen to me. Maybe...he&#39;s moved on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t be ridiculous. There&#39;s no way Kael would move on that easily. We both know he loves you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slight shrug, his face still tinged with sorrow.&#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m honestly scared of the guy rightnow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to say more but stopped when l felt nauseated. My stomach twisted painfully, and before I knew it, I was running toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely registered Jace coming after me before I was bent over the toilet, throwing all up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Lyric!&#34; Jace put his arms around my shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat hurt by the time I finished. I flushed the toilet, then washed my mouth and face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sick&lt;? Taken any drugs yet?&#34; He asked worriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine. It just started.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not about being fine. Make sure you take some medications.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a mental note to actually take it seriously since I was already throwing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Being away for one week left a lot of workload on my desk. There were so many files I had to go through from the company, so many reports from the Pack,and many others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to force myself to be away from Lyric so I could work in my home office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric. My time with her still felt surreal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the past week, she&#39;s made me feel things I&#39;d never felt before. And last night, she gave me the best part of her. The conscious and willing her. It was more than I could&#39;ve asked for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d managed to work until midday and felt like checking up on her. But before I could round up to leave, a call came in from Chairman Lyon. It seemed a little off. The Chairman didn&#39;t make calls himself unless it was gravely important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyon,&#34; I picked the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris. I trust you&#39;re doing great?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. We&#39;ll need you over at the Silver Citadel. As soon as possible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something pricked my guts.&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just some information we&#39;ve received and would like to process if you don&#39;t mind. Please, do come as soon as you can. We&#39;re already waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment passed before I told him I&#39;d be there and dropped the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My guts groaned the truth at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden. He&#39;d made good of his threats. He&#39;d taken my blood issue to the Council already.</p>
