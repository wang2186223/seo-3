                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you mean you can&#39;t find the body?&#34; She hissed over the phone, her grip tight around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am. We shot her, but she was on the bridge and fell over.&#34; The man replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And tell me, how stupid can you be? Huh? How do you shoot someone and just let her fall into a body of water?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>·Marta fisted her hand in her hair as she paced her room. She was losing her mind. Why couldn&#39;t she get one thing right? Just one?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to find her,&#34; she stopped in front of the window. &#34;I don&#39;t care if you think she&#39;s dead. I need to see her body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We already have people underwater looking for her, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find her soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You better. Otherwise, be rest assured you&#39;re not getting your balance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ended the call with a curse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already had enough to worry about and couldn&#39;t begin to worry about Penelope&#39;s missing body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At least the woman was gone for good. But she wouldn&#39;t really be at peace until her body was found.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was about turning away when a sight caught her attention from the window. She had seen the cars and van drive in and didn&#39;t pay any attention to it. But she was surprised when she saw Jaris carrying someone in his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She strained her eyes and was taken aback when she realized it was Lyric. JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned against the wal, my legs crossed with my hands tucked into my pant pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been thirty minutes since we reached the Pack. I had all the doctors available work on her and so far,she looked more relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it still wasn&#39;t enough to get this sick feeling packing from my belly. My heart was still a site for cold rage.My knuckles itched to ram into something. My tongue craved to taste blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should sit.&#34; Kael&#39;s voice sounded foreign in my ear. It pulled me out of the dark abyss that was my mind, making me more conscious of my surroundings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been standing this way since we brought her in. As you can see, she&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even glance at him but kept my gaze fixed on the sleeping lady in the middle of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the applications the doctors had done, her face still looked badly bruised. So was her body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it&#39;d take days for her to completely heal up. She didn&#39;t deserve this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was, she was very lucky. Caden didn&#39;t have a reason to spare her life. He could&#39;ve easily killed her to spite me, and to be honest, I thought I was going to find her dead in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if she wasn&#39;t lucky enough and actually ended up dead? What would I have done knowing she died because of me? What would I have done without Lyric Harper in my life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question startled me, drawing my brows in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard running footsteps behind me. I recognized them before my little sister showed up at the door.Her eyes widened as soon as they saw Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the gods! Lyric!&#34; She ran forward, not sparing me, Kael or Nerion a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran to the bed, grabbing Lyric&#39;s hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric? Lyric!&#34; &#34;Please, be careful, Princess,&#34; one of the doctors said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also wanted to snap at her for being careless with someone who was that injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry!&#34; She squealed, dropping the hand immediately. &#34;Will she be fine? Why isn&#39;t she awake?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We gave her something to put her to sleep. She needs it at this moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy nodded, then her eyes shifted to me. They were glossy. How long had she known Lyric that she was being this emotional?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened to her? Where were you when this happened, huh?!&#34; She yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cocked my brow. What was wrong with her brain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew this was a mistake. What was she thinking being mated to someone like you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you take your undeveloped brain elsewhere? She doesn&#39;t need the noise.&#34; I was trying so hard to keep my cool.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t even seem affected by my snide comment but kept mumbling to herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric didn&#39;t need this nuisance right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gestured at Kael. &#34;Get her out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nerion went instead. Maddy threw him a death glare before he even got to where she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you dare touch me. Don&#39;t you-&#34; Her words were cut off when Nerion grabbed her hand and pulled her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She fought and struggled against him, but in the end, her strength was useless against someone like Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they were out the door, I could still hear them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think you can touch me, you sick bastard!&#34; I heard her hit him on the chest. &#34;This better be the last time you lay your filthy hands on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It will. As long as you put yourself in order.&#34; Maddy&#39;s witty jab didn&#39;t come immediately, indicating she must be shocked at his response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better! I&#39;ll rather have other men touch me than you, anyway! You pathetic-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough.&#34; Nerion&#39;s voice was frigid. &#34;There are people in there. Now, behave and go to your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me what to do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just leave, Mad.&#34; He called her by the nickname he always used when things were still good between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard footsteps, followed by him reentering the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even look at him. I cared about nothing else but the woman in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bring her to my room,&#34; I instructed Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Nerion shot me bewildered glances but | didn&#39;t wake around to see more of their judgy eyes as l walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after I reached my room, Lyric was brought in. I felt a little better as I watched them place her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors were through with her for the night and said all she needed was enough rest for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to sleep in the medical room, and there was no way I was sleeping in a separate room from Lyric tonight. Hence the reason I requested her to be brought here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there...anything else you need?&#34; Kael asked after placing her on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head no and watched them leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally alone with her.</p>
