                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped at a spot, my fingers going into my hair and pulling at my roots. I was trying-trying so hard to remain calm. Because I knew if I had to really snap,only the innocent ones around me would get to suffer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say, Margaret?&#34; I could hardly even hear myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry. It was one of the women that was supposed to keep an eye on him. She was one of us,and we trusted her. We were just as shocked when we discovered she had him released.&#34; She was still sobbing. She was scared. And oh, she had the right to be. Because right now, I was really thinking about going over and doing all the things I imaginedlast night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did she release him unconscious? It&#39;s impossible for him to get out of his condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| know. But she got help. We were just as surprised,Alpha. This strange lady, she was able to heal him in mere minutes. We-We suspect she&#39;s a Siphon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My ears rang. A Siphon!? No. No way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you saying? Siphons don&#39;t exist anymore.&#34;They were forbidden. Only death awaited a Siphon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They do, Alpha. At least, this very lady does.The Executioners have been secretly looking for her for some time now. She&#39;s the reason your brother escaped.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Margaret,how long has this been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s been over a year, Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;re just telling me!? Are you stupid?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; she whimpered. &#34;We just didn&#39;t want to face your wrath. We&#39;ve been trying so hard to find him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,the fools!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where&#39;s she? The woman that betrayed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s dead already. We killed her as soon as we discovered what she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,now I wish they didn&#39;t. I&#39;d have loved nothing more than to make her suffer myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your move was stupid, Margaret. As soon as he was out,  you should&#39;ve told me!&#34; I kicked the table. &#34;I know. I&#39;m sorry, Alpha. I&#39;m so sorry. I thought we could handle it on our own.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it, I need to punch something. Or someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the details of the Siphon. Give me every single thing you have on her. And don&#39;t think I&#39;m done with you. You and your incompetent people are definitely going to pay for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call with an angry huff and sent for my mum. She needed to know what was happening with her son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For three days, I&#39;d been trying to get Jaris to have Jace released. But he wouldn&#39;t even listen to me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I did something I knew would get him upset but was necessary.I reported the issue to Jace&#39;s father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the Chairman heard that his son was imprisoned, he rushed over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood at the balcony, watching Jaris and the Chairman argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get him out, Alpha Jaris. I&#39;d hate to say it again.&#34; Jace&#39;s father was naturally intimidating, and right now,he was furious. But Jaris didn&#39;t seem to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your son committed an offense in my Pack. He gets punished by my rules, Lyon. You of all people should know this is how it works.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t care, Jaris. He&#39;s my son! And he&#39;s been there for days.I need you to get him out. This instant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris shrugged, nonchalantly. &#34;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t really do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, let him go,&#34;. Luna Isolde said, walking into the group. &#34;Come on, son. The boy was foolish,yes. But let&#39;s respect the fact that he&#39;s Lyon&#39;s son. Just let him go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took three more elders to come talk to Jaris before he finally decided to listen. Goodness, the boy was stubborn. It was a miracle he was actually a good leader to the Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Jace was brought out, his father went to him,holding his shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay, son? Were you hurt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; He grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I also went close and gave him a tight hug. I&#39;d been visiting him everyday since he was locked up, but seeing him out here was different. Relieving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry you went through this,&#34; I whispered before pulling out of his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t exactly know what went wrong, but I&#39;ve known Jace long enough to know he wouldn&#39;t just lie with something that serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris stepped up to him, the look in eyes her making it obvious he wasn&#39;t happy that Jace was free. He probably wanted him to suffer more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take note, Jace Ashford, this is the last time you&#39;ll set foot in my Pack. The next time you do, there&#39;ll be no one to save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace clenched his jaw. He looked like he had something to retort, but his father&#39;s hand on his shoulder stopped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt cold liquid on my cheek, and when I touched it,I discovered I&#39;d been crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This didn&#39;t go the way we planned. Now, Jace would no longer be here with me in Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; his father urged. &#34;They&#39;ll bring your things to the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace turned and started walking away. Then, he paused and looked back at Jaris. &#34;I understand you&#39;re mad and all. Maybe I&#39;d be too if somebody lied about my kids and gave me a scare. But I. Didn&#39;t. Lie.&#34; He shook his head. &#34;You need to look deeper, Alpha Jaris.If the DNA result accurately said positive, then it&#39;s possible those kids came from someone who was truly pregnant for you. But it was never Marta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart lodged in my throat. I expected Jaris to snap.Jace was still crossing the line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But to my surprise, Jaris didn&#39;t. Instead, his brows furrowed, as if he was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace continued walking with his father, not sparing another glance back.</p>
