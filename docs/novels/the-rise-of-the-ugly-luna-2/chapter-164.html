                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shifted uncomfortably on her feet. &#34;I-I haven&#39;t seen my sister in years. I don&#39;t know where she is.&#34; She stepped back and tried shutting the door,but Jace was quick to hold it open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, we mean no harm. If you know something,please help us. The reason we&#39;re looking for her-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just told you, I don&#39;t know anything,&#34; she snapped.&#34;Now get off my property and stop looking for my sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slammed the door in our faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jace. &#34;She&#39;s hiding something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She definitely is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair. &#34;What do we do?What if she knows something about Penelope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace stared at the door for some time. &#34;Right now,she&#39;s paranoid. We shouldn&#39;t give her a reason to mess things for us. She might erase any trace of Penelope and ruin our chances at finding her. We should make her think we&#39;re really backing off.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T-Then,how do we-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll keep an eye on her. I&#39;ll come around tonight and see what she knows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed my hand. &#34;We&#39;ll find them, Lyric. We&#39;re close; I can feel it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods,I hoped so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With each day, I was starting to feel like a loser for not being able to find them. I&#39;d been trying not to think about it, but were they actually fine? Who have they been with for six years? Were they loved and treated right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, you never mentioned their father,&#34; Jace said as we settled back in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stalled with my seatbelt, thinking of the best response to give to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d like to keep that a secret, please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, he didn&#39;t press.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived Darkspire and I felt a sense of relief when I found Kael outside, leaning against his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Him being home meant Jaris was home,right? Something about Kael&#39;s demeanor seemed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was smoking. He actually did smoke, but he always did it in private.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,however, he was doing it right outside, where anyone could easily see him. He wasn&#39;t even wearing a suit but something casual; like he had been home for a long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Which was unsettling because I knew Jaris must&#39;ve gone to wvork.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Kael.&#34; I waved at him, but he didn&#39;t even spare me a glance. His dark eyes were on Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jace with furrowed brows, trying to understand what was going on. My bestfriend looked too quiet. Okay. Something was definitely up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about walking away to leavethem to it when Kael spoke up. &#34;How was she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped mid-step, looking back at him. His eyes were still on Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have a good time with her? Did you realize she was what you wanted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, I understood the emotion I&#39;d seen in Kael&#39;s eyes. They weren&#39;t just dark. They were hurt. Looking at Jace, his face was filled with guilt. &#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck do you know about what I think?&#34;Kael rasped,peeling himself away from the car. His movement was so aggressive, even I got a bit scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know the things I had to say to get you here?How fucking hard I had to convince my boss. I told him I wanted to keep you close to me. Cause I thought you fucking felt the same! Who knew it&#39;d be so easy for you to go whoring around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holy smokes, it became clear to me. Why Jace was gone for long yesterday while I was at TCH, and why he returned with a lipstick stain on his neck. Please,don&#39;t tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what | think, Jace?&#34; Kael inched toward him.&#34;I think you should&#39;ve been honest about your sexuality. I didn&#39;t force shit on you,you know?&#34; His eyes flicked to mine, a little hatefully. &#34;Maybe you just needed me to get close to your best friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words made me feel terrible, but | didn&#39;t even know how to blame him &#39;cause I understood how hurt he must be. Why would Jace do a thing like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, man. It&#39;s not what you think,&#34; Jace tried going closer to him. &#34;I promise I can explain if you just let me. But I swear, I never lied to you.&#34; &#34;You&#39;re right for asking my permission. Cause I&#39;m not letting you explain why the hell you went to fuck someone else. You should&#39;ve told me you weren&#39;t interested from the onset. Would have saved us both a lot of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael. Kael!&#34; Jace called, but he didn&#39;t even glance back at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got into his car and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell was that?&#34; I turned to Jace. But he didn&#39;t look at me as he stormed into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to scurry to catch up with his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! Did you really cheat on him? Why would you do such a thing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now, Lyric,&#34;he threw at me without looking back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped walking in the hallway and could only watch as he stormed into his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was over the Jace and Kael drama,I proceeded to check on Jaris. He wasn&#39;t homne yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins came to spend some time with me and that took my mind off him for some hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was night and I was sure he&#39;d be back, I went back to his room again. But when I knocked repeatedly, there was no response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing out so late today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t even ask Kael with what happened earlier today. Maybe I should ask Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was heading to his room when I ran into Maddy with someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was backed up against the wall, the boy&#39;s hand wrapped possessively around her waist while she laughed at whatever he whispered in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked in surprise when they kissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it a coincidence that this was actually happening a few steps from Nerion&#39;s room?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; she waved when she noticed me. But she didn&#39;t try to free herself from the boy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t even look familiar. It was obvious she brought him home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you looking for someone?&#34; Maddy asked, her hands cupping the boy&#39;s cheeks. She was seeming a bit drunk. &#34;Yes.I was-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could finish my statement, the door opened behind me. I already knew it was Nerion before l turned around and saw him coming from his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped on a dime, and it wasn&#39;t hard to figure out what was running through his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at Maddy and she was holding the boy even more possessively. She had her hands on him and made it seem like she hadn&#39;t even noticed Nerion was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...hey,&#34; I turned to Nerion. &#34;I&#39;ve been looking for Alpha Jaris. It&#39;s late, but he isn&#39;t home yet. Is there a reason he&#39;s staying out late?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took a little longer for his eyes to leave Maddy and move to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He isn&#39;t home.&#34; Was his simple reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But do you know when he&#39;ll be back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not yet. We&#39;ve been trying to reach him. Why don&#39;t you go get a room? It&#39;s shameless doing this out here.&#34;He directed at Maddy and her strange man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, knowing a hell of a drama was coming. &#34;You didn&#39;t build this place, Nerion. I don&#39;t think you have the right to dish out such orders,&#34; Maddy snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion&#39;s stare was as cold and clear as icicles as he walked toward them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to be forgetting the position I hold in this place.&#34; He looked at the boy. &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy stepped in between them. &#34;Don&#39;t answer him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am the head of security over here. It is my right to access everyone that steps foot in the Pack. I don&#39;t know this man, and I don&#39;t trust him. So, I&#39;m going to ask him to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll do no such thing!&#34; She stomped her foot angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Nerion&#39;s turn to smile. &#34;I guess we should wait around and see what happens if he remains here by the time I&#39;m back.&#34; He walked out on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not having the time for Maddy&#39;s rants,I followed after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught up with him and asked him more about Jaris,but he wasn&#39;t of much help. It was as if they didn&#39;t know anything of his whereabouts I returned to my room, deciding I&#39;d try a little while later. But I slept off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By morning, I was sure he&#39;d be back and proceeded to check on him. But when I learned he didn&#39;t come home last night,worry set in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was unlike Jaris. Something might be wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried calling him on phone but couldn&#39;t reach him.Kael and Nerion were not in the pack either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was going on?</p>
