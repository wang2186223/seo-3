                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my hold around my shopping basket as I dipped my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Alpha Zarek. Sorry, I almost bumped into you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s nothing.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;I didn&#39;t know you came to such places.You deal with medicines?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s nice. I only came over to check for certain things. It&#39;s a good thing that I met you here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A good thing? Why&#39;s it a good thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a smile as I stepped away. &#34;Take care, Alpha.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked away, continuing with my shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I was done and went over to the counter to clear my bills. To my surprise, the man at the counter simply packed them up and handed them over without asking me to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone already took care of your bill,&#34; he stunned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh?&#34;Who&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Zarek,.&#34; He tipped his head behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly, I found the Alpha learning against a shelf, waving at me with a weird smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay...Why would he do a thing like this? I never asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping the bags, I went over to meet him. &#34;You didn&#39;t have to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t stress your tongue over something so little. It&#39;s change,Lyric.&#34; &#34;Thanks, but I really don&#39;t need it. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to pay for them myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small frown touched his brow. &#34;Why would you want to do that? Aren&#39;t you used to people doing you favors?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just trying to be extra careful like Jaris wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry, but I can&#39;t accept it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dipping my hand, I returned to the counter where I took care of it myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I played a song and sang along with it as I drove back to Darkspire. This car was pretty smooth. And expensive.Why would Jaris even want me to have it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I remembered the contract. I had access to every property of Darkspire. Hm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached the Pack House and some maids came over to help me get the things inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before I could go in with them, Kael approached me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.You need to come with me.&#34; The look on his face. It wasn&#39;t good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O...kay. But there&#39;s no problem, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated, then sighed. &#34;It&#39;s AIpha Roderick. He&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every nerve in my body went taut. Air abandoned my lungs as I struggled to breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick. He was here. To finally ruin me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood rooted to the door for some seconds, not having the courage to move. What if he&#39;s told Jaris the truth already? How could he really do this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael turned and started waIking head, but he stopped  when he noticed I wasn&#39;t following. &#34;You need to move-now. He and Alpha Jaris have been waiting for you for hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the hunt! That son of a bitch! He really did keep to his words!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shook as I retrieved my phone from my purse and called father. Fortunately, he picked up almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, Roderick is here.&#34; A mix of fear and anger went through my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s with Alpha Jaris now. You need to come over. I don&#39;t know what to do.&#34; I hung up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t divulge much, not when Kael was giving me that suspicious stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I went in with him and met Jaris, Luna Isolde and Roderick in the conference hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, for the love of the moon! Even Jaris&#39; mother was here! I was truly cooked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I studied Jaris&#39; expression as I entered. Does he know the truth already? His face was as solid as granite. So,it was hard to tell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fell on Roderick, and I gave him the death glare The asshole was smirking at me, having that look of &#39;I told you so.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, dear. It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re here.&#34; Luna Isolde said, her voice firm. &#34;Alpha Roderick claims to have some information he&#39;d like to share.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lump formed in my throat. I had to swallow really hard to take it down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh... Why don&#39;t we discuss this outside, Roderick?&#34; I forced a nervous smile as I looked at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; Jaris interjected. &#34;I want to hear what he has to say.&#34; He looked at Roderick. &#34;Tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let my eyes stay on Roderick, sending him a silent plea. But the bastard actually smirked and shifted his gaze to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric and I are bonded.&#34; Oh,no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde gasped, confusion marring lines on her forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, embracing the darkness that was about to consume me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Five years ago, we were mates. Until she suddenly vanished, only to return now and get engaged to you.l was quite shocked when I learned you two were getting mated. Then, it dawned on me that she hadn&#39;t told you the truth. But it&#39;s kind of who she is. She&#39;d do anything to get what she wants.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, what&#39;s he talking about?&#34; Luna Isolde asked, shock echoing in her tone. &#34;You know you can&#39;t get mated to someone if you&#39;re still bonded to another. How can you do this!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening my eyes, they fell on Jaris who was giving me that very cold look. It sent shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s notwhat you think,&#34; I whimpered, lowering my eyes to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Lyric; I wouldn&#39;t come all the way here to state a lie. Our ribbon is still intact at the temple! How could you do this to us!?&#34; He shook his head, looking bittered. &#34;You know, I tried talking her out of this. But she was too stubborn and wouldn&#39;t listen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is not how it happened!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, tell us how it happened, Lyric. Explain yourself in a way that&#39;d justify trying to have two men to yourselves!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat was so tight, I thought I was going to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell us your story,&#34; It was Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small gasp escaped me as I lifted my eyes to meet his. It was the first comment he was making. He wanted to hear from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roderick... and I used to be mated,&#34; the emotions flooded me as I forced the story out. &#34;But during the time we were together, he treated me like a slave. In less than two years, he rejected me,because he&#39;d already gotten what he wanted, which was power. He ended things with me and kicked me out. We&#39;d have been through by now, but we&#39;re yet to complete the last step in the temple. Roderick kept pestering me to come back so we could finish the process and I could move on with my life. But when I did come, he suddenly refused to complete it. Instead,&#34; my eyes hardened as they looked at the monster.&#34;he wanted us to come back together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He wouldn&#39;t go to the temple with me. For weeks, my father and I had been trying to reach him so we could complete the process, but he&#39;s been proving stubborn.&#34; I dropped my eyes to the floor. &#34;I didn&#39;t want to bother you with these details. But believe me, I wouldn&#39;t havegone through with the ceremony if I hadn&#39;t completely ended things with Roderick. My father and I were hoping we&#39;d be able to get him to come around before the ceremony. I&#39;m sorry.&#34; My voice cracked at the last word. Before I knew it, a tear was rolling down my cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffed as I wiped it off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Roderick, is that true?&#34; Luna Isolde asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick rolled his eyes. &#34;Please, don&#39;t believe a word that girl says. She&#39;s really good at lying.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s say she&#39;s good at lying,&#34; Jaris stood up, gentle and collected. &#34;But did you two reject each other five years ago?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick frowned.&#34;Y-Yes.But-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, the only step remaining is the ribbon at the temple?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, what&#39;re you waiting for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room was silent for a while. Slipping his hand into his pocket, Jaris stepped down from the raised platform where he had been seated and walked toward Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You see, Roderick,&#34; his voice was calm, his footsteps unhurried. &#34;I don&#39;t really care what happened between you two in the past. Right now, Lyric and I are getting mated. I am really grateful you came here,because you just alerted me of a problem I had no idea existed. Right now, we&#39;re all going to the temple to cut the ribbon.&#34;</p>
