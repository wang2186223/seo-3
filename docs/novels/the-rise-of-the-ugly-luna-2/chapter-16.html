                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went through the contract multiple times. What was required of me was quite simple-represent Darkspire as their Luna for one year, accompany Jaris to important events and functions, be loyal to the Pack,and treat his son.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In return, I was guaranteed protection, unlimited access to the properties of the Pack, and mny father&#39;s debt being cleared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed normal. And that was the point; I still didn&#39;t know what Darkspire was getting out of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d tried to ask Jaris about it, but he told me they were gaining nothing. And well, I couldn&#39;t force a different answer out of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But at the end of the day, I signed the contract. LunaIsolde was pleased and informed me that the coronation ceremony would be held in three days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was thrilled. I, Lyric,the girl who was constantly bullied and rejected, was going to be the Luna of the most powerful Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s only for a year. You&#39;ll still get rejected,&#34; my bitter subconsciousness told me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully, I&#39;d get to uncover the truth during my stay here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My father was beyond pleased when I returned to the estate and told him the contract had been signed.But I became worried when he told me he&#39;d been unable to reach Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Father, the ceremony&#39;s only in three days!&#34;|exclaimed. &#34;I cannot go through with it if I amstill being bonded to Roderick. Alpha Jaris&#39; night actually gets mad if he learns of this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I know. But we can&#39;t tell them yet.&#34; Lines of worry creased his forehead. &#34;Things are finally happening the right way, Lyric. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll handle Roderick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fisted my hands. That son of a bitch. What exactly was he playing at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father convinced me to ignore him and start gathering my things. In three days, I&#39;d be moving to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, Jace and I met up. He told me he had an errand to run and needed my company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, it wasn&#39;t new. When Jace and I were kids, we went everywhere together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I remembered one time, he had beaten a guy to a pulp for calling me a monster. Ugh, the good old days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still didn&#39;t understand why you&#39;re making me drive,&#34; I sounded grumpy as I took a turn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was seated beside me, munching on a can of chips. &#34;Stop whining, Ly. You should be grateful I&#39;m letting you drive my Thundra V8. It&#39;s the latest baby in the market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, considering the fact that you almost rammed into me two days ago, I&#39;d say you&#39;re scared and want to take some driving lessons from me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse you? That was intentional. Believe me,honey, I wouldn&#39;t risk my V8 for your skin.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke a laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the opportunity, I told him about Jaris and me. His reaction was well expected, shocked, and dramatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re telling me two days from now, you&#39;ll be Luna of Darkspire?&#34; I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s amazing news, and I&#39;d have loved to say congratulations, but why does it have to be for a year? A Pack needs a Luna that would last for a lifetime. So, why the hell is Darkspire making it look like they&#39;re heading somewhere or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wish I knew,&#34; I shrugged. And to be honest, it was the biggest problem I had. How was I sure I wasn&#39;t walking into some sort of trap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s delightful &#39;cause you&#39;ll finally be in power.At least, I have someone to kick asses for me. Not like I&#39;ve ever needed your lazy help, though.&#34; He winked at mne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! What the hell? I&#39;ve never been lazy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, yeah. Well remember that one time you were so strong you cried when that mean girl-what was her name again-Michelle, said awful words to you?I mean, all you had to do was talk back at her, Lyric.But you just stood there, crying your eyes out until l came to rescue you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes.&#34;We were just nine years old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Michelle had been the daughter of an Alpha of a neighboring Pack. She was everything I was not-beautiful, smart, well-loved and admired by everyone. Back then, I didn&#39;t know how to talk back at people like her. But yeah, she had been a really mean bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Michelle was just nine as well, yet she made you cry.Just saying,&#34; Jace added with a shrug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally reached his destination and he stepped out of the car,leaving me alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched him run into the tall, skyscraper building.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Central Hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the largest hospital in the country, filled with only the best doctors. People flew in from every corner of the world to get treated here because, well,if you couldn&#39;t find a solution in TCH, there was a very good chance that your ailment didn&#39;t have a cure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a deep breath, mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was younger, I&#39;d come here at least, thrice a week, just stand out here and stare at the building.I&#39;d watch people go in and out, some would come out happy, others would come out sad. I used to wonder if I could ever have a chance to work there. But only the strongest doctors were allowed there, and I didn&#39;t even have a wolf. They&#39;d definitely kick me out if I were interviewed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I placed my head on the steering wheel, trying to pull my attention to somewhere more convenient.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes passed, and I figured Jace was running late.I looked at the hospital again, and this time,my heart sank into the very pit of my stomach. The sight before me shattered me completely, making it almost impossible for me to breathe.</p>
