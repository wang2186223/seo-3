                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t get any sleep the entire night, and until morning, he still wasn&#39;t back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused as much as I was scared. Something was definitely wrong with him. And the worst part?|didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By noon, I decided to do something crazy. I had to call Kael. If Jace had been captured or something,Kael should know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shook as I listened to the phone beep.What if they manage to track my phone or something? Kael might&#39;ve helped me escape, but it didn&#39;t mean he was going to keep covering my ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t matter. I needed to know what had happened with Jace. The call was almost ending when Kael picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric? Why are you calling?&#34; He spoke in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s-It&#39;s Jace. Has he been captured?&#34;|nervously fumbled with my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about?! Captured by who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. This only meant he wasn&#39;t captured. So,what happened to him?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric? Talk to me!&#34; He snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-I don&#39;t know. He just... he went out yesterday to get some stuff a-and he isn&#39;t back yet. I don&#39;t know,Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it. I knew this was a bad idea.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An uneasy pause lingered in the air while I processed the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think the Executioners got to him? Maybe they think he helped me escape and they-&#34; &#34;That&#39;s a possibility. They were already suspicious of him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gods.&#34; I pulled at my hair in frustration as l started pacing the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do, Kael? They might be torturing him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I refused to imagine how terrible it must be. Jace helpless with them.What if they end up killing him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try to get to them. See if they really took him.&#34;Unfortunately, Kael&#39;s words did little to calm me.l needed to know that Jace was fine, and I needed to know now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-How soon can you get this done? You need to hurry,Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, Jace used me, okay? He didn&#39;t tell me he was escaping with you. He didn&#39;t reach out to me or even take my damn calls. Now, this happened? A lot has been happening here as well, Lyric. Honestly, I wish we didn&#39;t have your issue to deal with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His sentence gripped me. What else has been happening?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Kael, but I didn&#39;t want any of this to happen. I tried to get Jace to leave, he just wouldn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words were cut short when I heard a familiar voice in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on. We need to get moving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stop, as did my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only heard it over the phone, yet it was enough to make me feel like he&#39;d whispered it in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be with you shortly, King,&#34; Kael replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes turned glossy as I imagined Jaris walking away. For the first time in over a week, he felt so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to go. I&#39;ll call you as soon as I get something.&#34;Kael ended the call before | could say anything. Not like I had the strength to. Until the following day, Jace was still not back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tired of crying and felt sick already. Kael had become unreachable. I couldn&#39;t help but fear that something terrible was happening beyond my knowledge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so alone and in the dark here. The world might be burning out there and I wouldn&#39;t even know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no more food stuff at home. I&#39;d been starving since morning and needed to go out there to find something to eat. Maybe I&#39;d also get information on Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately for me, he had left some cash behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dressed up in a pair of black jeans, black hoodie and a face cap. Then, I left the house for the first time and kept walking until I came across the first store.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace would kill me if he knew I left the house. Well, it was night. Maybe nobody would see me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my head down as I walked into the store. It was a little filled with people, making me uncomfortable.Thankfully, none of them were paying attention to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed a basket, then proceeded to pick what l wanted from the shelves. I was as fast as I could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed some men arguing around me. For a moment, I was scared they were talking about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Come on, Lyric; not everything is about you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tore my gaze away and proceeded to the counter to get my items checked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The weather&#39;s pretty cold, huh?&#34; The man at the counter said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He focused on checking my items. Seeing that he looked friendly...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... would you happen to have seen my friend the day before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a furrowed look. &#34;A lot of people come in here, you know. You&#39;d have to be a little more specific.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went ahead to describe Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34; think he comes in a few times. He&#39;s quite funny.But I&#39;m not sure I saw him two days ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every shred of hope I had vanished into thin air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? He suddenly went missing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Um....I just went to his place and couldn&#39;t find him. Don&#39;t know what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should probably take up the matter,then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed movements in the store-people coming and leaving. I didn&#39;t fail to look at every one of them, and that was how I knew when they entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blood turned to ice at the sight of the Executioners coming in. It was hard to miss a man like Cole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped and quickly looked away, wanting to hide my face from them. When I carefully looked again,l found them talking to some of the men in the store showing them a poicture. They were looking for me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your total bill is fifty three bucks, Ms,&#34; the man said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was barely listening to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am?&#34; He snapped my attention back to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry.I have to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved immediately, walking to the backdoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Excuse me, Ms!&#34; Someone called behind me,stopping me dead in my tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the attendant. It was one of the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell,no!</p>
