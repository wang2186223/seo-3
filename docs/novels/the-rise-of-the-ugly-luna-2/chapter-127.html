                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up earlier than usual that morning, and the first thing I did was to go look for Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his office was locked and he wouldn&#39;t open the door to his room when I knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way he&#39;d gone out, right? This was the reason I woke up early so I&#39;d catch him before he went anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s still asleep, ma&#39;am.&#34; Someone said behind me when I knocked on his door again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to find one of the servants smiling at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. How do you know that?&#34; I pulled my robe tighter together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just finished working around here. He hasn&#39;t stepped out of his room yet.&#34; Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to wait around, but that would make me look ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I returned to my room, deciding to come check again in fifteen minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found a message from Jace by the timeI reached the room. It was the address, accompanied with the Elder&#39;s phone number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sighed in relief and tried calling the number immediately. But he didn&#39;t pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, maybe he was still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so eager I thought of rushing over to his place as soon as I&#39;d seen Jaris. But tomorrow was the kids&#39;birthday, and Maddy and I were meant to do some more shopping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yup. As crazy as it sounded, she wanted me to go with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a bath and found something good to wear. Then, I went back to Jaris&#39; room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, he still won&#39;t open up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; I mumbled under my breath as l knocked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How can he still be asleep by this time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34; | turned around in a start at the sound of Maddy&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood with her arms crossed and gave me a weird look. &#34;This is the second time you&#39;re knocking desperately on his door. What is going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows. &#34;How do you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was watching when you came the first time. You just didn&#39;t see me,&#34; she cut me off wwith an eye roll.&#34;What is so important, anyway? Please, don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re only desperate to wish him a happy morning.It&#39;d be sad to know you&#39;re one of those ladies who have fallen helplessly for my monster of a brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I stepped away from the door. Fine. I wasn&#39;t having this conversation with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to leave but she got in the way. &#34;Honestly, I think you should be worried about the fact that you&#39;re his mate. You don&#39;t understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What don&#39;t I understand?&#34; I crossed my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips moved for some seconds without producing words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go get ready, Maddy. We need to leave early.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand!&#34; She half-yelled. &#34;There is something about him you all don&#39;t know about.There&#39;s always been something about him and our brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that brought me to a stop. My forehead crinkled with a frown as I looked at her. &#34;Your brother? The one that&#39;s dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, like I&#39;d said something ridiculous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right. I should go get ready.&#34; She rolled her eyes and left. In an hour time, Maddy and I were ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d tried getting her to change what she had on but she wouldn&#39;t listen. It was a mini skirt that was just above her thighs, a bra top and a jacket. Her long hair was styled into two ponytails with a pink ribbon around each. She adorned all five fingers on her left hand with small gold rings while her right wrist was filled with multiple bracelets. And of course, she had makeup on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The girl was small in statue, and she didn&#39;t try to make it any better with her dress sense. She could easily be mistaken for a teenager, whereas she was twenty years old.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had it in mind to go check on Jaris again, but when Maddy and I reached the staircase, I found him heading toward the door with Nerion and Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A haze of confusion enveloped me when I noticed he was wearing a turtleneck shirt. What the hell? It covered his entire neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;G-Good morning, Alpha Jaris.&#34; I dipped my head,almost clumsily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy huffed. &#34;Stop paying him such respect, Lyric.He&#39;s not worth it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes rounded with shock. What was wrong with her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And will you stop staring at me like that?&#34; She snapped at someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood behind Jaris, looking smart in a black suit and hands crossed behind his back. Despite Maddy&#39;s warning, his gaze didn&#39;t falter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve become like him,&#34; she said with irritation.&#34;|can&#39;t believe you used to be my friend. Make sure you stay as far away from me as possible.&#34; She stomped her foot angrily and flounced out of the room,leaving me behind. Goodness. The girl had a terrible temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I guess she was just like her brother. Only that she was a little crazier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; Jaris appeared more relaxed since his sister was out. &#34;One of the servants told me you came looking for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; just as I opened my mouth to speak, Maddy was back in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, she came to see you. Your trick is working on her, isn&#39;t it? You always make the ladies fall for you. Will you kill her like you killed the others?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she stood by the door and eavesdropped?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy!&#34; Jaris growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now he was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay,but what was she talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy, shut up and get out.&#34; It was Nerion. &#34;Don&#39;t tell me to shut up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, that&#39;s enough.&#34; I ran to Maddy, holding her hand. &#34;Go wait for me. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Jaris with teary eyes before running out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair, feeling exhausted already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m... sorry about that.&#34; Why was I apologizing like she was my sister?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You um... you wearing a turtleneck today.&#34; I cleared my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously, Lyric. The statement was odd considering what just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and the others looked at me with perplexity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wore a turtleneck three days ago. What&#39;s the problem?&#34; Jaris cocked a brow at me.</p>
