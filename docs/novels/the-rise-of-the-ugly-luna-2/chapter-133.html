                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re you doing, Lyric?&#34; The frostiness in her tone didn&#39;t make it seem like she actually cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was naturally cold and intimidating-something that proved she was the mother of Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m doing just great, Luna. And you?&#34;|added the last words hesitantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, she didn&#39;t answer that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It seems...you and Jaris are getting along well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My forehead creased as I met her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I notice the cheerfulness between you two these days. Yesterday, you even visited him at his office.&#34;She scoffed.&#34;How cute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay.What was she driving at? &#34;Is...there a problem, Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, not.&#34; She shrugged. &#34;I just hope you stil remember what your deal is with Jaris. This whole thing-it&#39;s fake. It&#39;s a contract. And in less than eleven months from now, it&#39;s all goingto end.&#34; Her words pushed my beating organ deep into my lower belly, tying my tongue as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t understand. She came all the way to say that to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it with everyone and wanting to get me upset today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; I mumbled, keeping my head low.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I could talk back at Marta and anyone else, it&#39;d be a grave mistake talking back at someone like Luna Isolde. She&#39;d been a lioness in her time. And while she might be older, I feared she still had some of that fierceness in her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her gaze linger on my form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good,&#34; she muttered, and the sound of her heels announced her departure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An unpleasant bitterness curled on my tongue,reaching down to my gut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After trying not to let anyone ruin my mood, Luna Isolde succeeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;It&#39;s fake.&#39; &#39;It&#39;s a contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words were haunting. They were what people would call the bitter truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I weren&#39;t meant to be. The dreams I had with him were fake. The butterflies that always filled my heart each time I saw him were fake. The warmth that consistently welled up in my lower belly every time I watched him laugh couldn&#39;t happen anymore,because this was a contract. And Jaris Dreadmoor was never meant to be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the field filled with distinguished guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a lot of kids around as they&#39;d asked all the guests to come with their kids. Even the people from the twins&#39; school were invited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The party itself dazzled with unparalleled grandeur.Everything looked just like it was supposed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to keep a smile on my face as I walked in.I struggled to silence the torturous rhythm of my heart, but it thudded on with a lot of words getting to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a Siphon who had an Executioner on her tail.I also had an insane woman always rubbing it on my face that I was someone who liked kids but didn&#39;t have any.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, a Luna wwho just reminded me that I was nothing but a contracted Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My steps faltered when I caught sight of Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart....it did that thing again. That thing that always made me melt completely at the sight of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s fake, Lyric. It&#39;s a contract. However, it was hard to focus on that when he stood there, looking like a god on earth. Everything about him was perfect-his black suit, the silver earring on one ear, the designer watch he had around his wrist,and down to the glass of champagne he had in one hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything might be fake, but I&#39;d never seen a more charming male like Jaris Dreadmoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to keep walking. I needed to check in on the caterer&#39;s spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when I got to where he was, he noticed me,andl didn&#39;t miss the way his eyes lit up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; he gave me a small smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze traveled from my head to my toe before he shook his head. &#34;Wow. You&#39;re... stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, stop talking. Please, stop talking. It was harder to focus when he talked like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks,&#34; I gave a nod. He kept his eyes on me as he drank slowly from his glass. And somehow, that was hot in a kind of way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you&#39;ve been greatly involved with the kids.Thank you, Lyric.&#34; He tipped his glass toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fluttered. At least someone was happy I was helping with the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone vibrated in my purse. I took it out and found Maddy&#39;s name on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, where are you?&#34; She sounded slightly frantic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m at the field.Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to come over. I&#39;m in my room.Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went as fast as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought I&#39;d find her in a distraught phase or something, but she was just there-looking like a princess in a castle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my goodness! Maddy, you look-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How do I look?&#34; She cut me off in a high voice, her eyes bright with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I just was about to say that. You look dazzling.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course! Takea look at yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her dress was a red one with off-shoulders and a slit by the side. She looked way better than when she was dressed like a teen. At least, her heels even gave her some height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to be perfect, Lyric. You know I&#39;ll be meeting a lot of people I haven&#39;t seen in a while. Plus, I need to make a good impression as an aunt. It&#39;s the first of their parties I&#39;m attending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went closer, taking her hand in mine. &#34;Don&#39;t sweat it, Maddy. You&#39;re a damsel right now. You should see what I see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a small anxious smile. &#34;Are you sure?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moon forbid I&#39;d be lying to you.&#34; I tilted my head at the door.&#34;Come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We walked out to the field together. Maddy kept holding my hand so tight like it was her lifeline.I wasn&#39;t used to seeing her this nervous. I thought she should be used to public gatherings or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We greeted some guests and took some drinks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? Everyone adores you,&#34; I whispered in her ear,earning me a giggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile dropped when she spotted someone. I saw it too.Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was walking with a lady, coming our way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Maddy go tense beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, Nerion looked nothing like the head of security. He looked like one of the distinguished guests who we were all honored to have in our midst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And who was the lady beside him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy kept her eyes on the floor as they walked past us. But I kept looking and noticed Nerion&#39;s gaze linger on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s gone,&#34; I felt the need to whisper to her so she could straighten her neck at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She balled her hands into fists. &#34;He&#39;s an asshole.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A backstabber.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kind of human everyone should avoid.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s such a snake. You&#39;ll think he&#39;s gentle and cares about you, but he&#39;ll strangle you when you least expect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; I placed my hands on her shoulders. &#34;Today&#39;s a special day for us, Maddy. Don&#39;t let Nerion or anyone else ruin it for you, okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her bite the inside of her cheeks. But eventually, she nodded and seemed calmer. We got to the most important part-the arrival of the celebrants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone stood quietly with smiles on as we watched the twins come up at the entrance, looking like a little prince and princess.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their outfits had been made to match, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever seen more adorable kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A cool sound was put on as they walked down the aisle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They lookadorable!&#34; Maddy chirped, clapping her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;More than adorable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes glistened with tears I fought to hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon was wearing a customized suit that had the same designs as his sister&#39;s long red dress. She even had a small crown on her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The guests cooed and made lovely sounds as they walked through. They waved at Maddy and I when they reached our line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They waved at me!&#34; Maddy squealed happily, like a kid. &#34;Look, Lyric! We&#39;re even wearing matching outfits!&#34; She pointed at her own red dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right!&#34; | laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the end of the aisle, Jaris and Marta joined them, taking their hands and leading them to their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something tugged in my heart at the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone gave a rousing applause for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted through the crowd and something gripped my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not something;someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I narrowed my eyes, trying to get a better look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, Maddy tapped me to ask something, and when I looked again, the person was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, not able to make sense of it.I thought I saw someone familiar among the guests,but I must&#39;ve been mistaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone took their seats as a welcome speech was given by Marta, and afterward, the main event kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Activities were introduced by the MC, including some games for the kids around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For hours, we laughed, clapped and commented on the numerous activities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were majorly on Xylon and Xyla the whole time. I couldn&#39;t get enough of how red their faces were as they had fun with the things taking place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and Marta sat closeby, their faces beaming with pride.I smiled wistfully. The joy of parenthood. I hope I get to experience it someday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, the kids were called to dance on stage.I was surprised at how good of a dancer Xylon was.His moves were a little too smooth for someone his age. Xyla was simply having fun and kept giggling at her clumsy steps. Compared to Xylon, she wasn&#39;t that good. But I wasn&#39;t even sure she noticed or cared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they finished with the dance, it was time for them to play a game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen up, kids,&#34; the MC addressed them. &#34;This game needs to be played with you and two adults.Xylon, I&#39;ll need you to pick a man of your choice to be your partner, and Xyla, you pick a woman. You can choose mummy and daddy if you want. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They nodded ecstatically and went their separate ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was eager for the game. I was sure it was going to be between Jaris and Marta. However, I was surprised when I noticed Xyla wasn&#39;t going toward her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone watched in anticipation, thinking maybe she was coming to pick them. It came as a big shock when she stopped in front of me, holding out her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want you to be my partner, aunty Lyric!&#34;</p>
