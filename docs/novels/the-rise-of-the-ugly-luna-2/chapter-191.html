                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My reflection was bleak, staring back at me in the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My makeup was quite simple with my hair styled into a bun and all. I looked a bit simple for someone who had been very excited for this day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it had to do with the fact that someone else was being crowned Grand Luna-and worst of it all, it was my enemy whom I was sure would do everything in her power to make life difficult for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ODr it had to do with the fact that I was pregnant for a man who could never be mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped sadly to the table in front of me.This was not the way I&#39;d envisioned this coronation to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock reached my door, dragging me out of my thoughts before Maddy pushed it open and scuttled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of her was enough to take my mind off the raging thoughts in my head for a little bit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Maddy. What&#39;re you wearing?&#34; I rolled my  eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She huffed, stopping in the middle of the room and staring down at her dress. &#34;I don&#39;t see anything wrong with it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Really? When she was wearing a thigh-length gown that was almost revealing her pants? If she bent carelessly, her pant and even her boobs would likely be seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is a coronation for Selene&#39;s sake! You couldn&#39;t find something more suitable to wear?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, spare me. Your mate should be grateful I&#39;m even coming to this thing at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to laugh. Funny coming from someone who, last night, couldn&#39;t stop talking about how fun it&#39;d be to move to the Central Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to get you. Come on. We should getgoing,&#34;She urged me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and Marta had to leave earlier to get certain things done. Though, he did try to convince me to fly with them,but I turned him down, not wanting to look like the one pushing herself between the couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since | returned to the Pack House two nights, he&#39;d been trying to make it up to me. We hadn&#39;t told anyone about it yet. I was too scared of all the reactions it&#39;d get and wasn&#39;t ready to face them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy and I flew to Darkspire, together with her mother and the kids. When we arrived the Silver Citadel, I spotted Jace and Kael talking. Kael was saying something while Jaris fixed his collars for him.It brought a small smile to my face. At least someone was lucky in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard Maddy huffing and cursing beside me. I looked at her, followed her line of sight and laughed when l saw who she was being pissed at. Who else other than Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you tried talking to him?&#34; I asked her as we left the car. &#34;To know why he neglected you like you claimed.I mean, if you two were that cool, I don&#39;t think he should&#39;ve just abandoned you like you meant nothing. Something must&#39;ve prompted him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah. I&#39;mm not interested.&#34; She scrunched her nose.&#34;The only reason he neglected me was because he chose Jaris over me. He didn&#39;t want to go against his dear friend and boss by standing up against my unjust detention.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That is just what you think, Maddy. His reason could be different.&#34; &#34;Then, he should&#39;ve tried talking to me about it. I mean, what exactly did I look like to him? Someone who cannot comprehend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked ahead of me, an indication that she wanted the topic to end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt bad for her. She truly loved him and had to endure everyday pretending she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she was also right. If Nerion had his own reasons for neglecting her, he should have owned up and told her about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were taken to the VIP section of the hall. The whole time, I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off Jaris who was seen discussing with the Elders on stage. Marta was seated behind him, busy with her phone,looking really stunning in her long floral dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How lucky she was. Despite being ill-mannered and all, she still got to be the one to spend the rest of her life with Jaris, with their beautiful kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Jaris finished with the Elders and returned to his seat, I noticed his eyes moving around the place, like he was looking for someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Me? His eyes locked with mine and they stopped moving.My heart soared in my chest, knowing I was who he&#39;d been looking for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me an acknowledging nod while I offered a small smile. My soon to be King. My perfect man who I could never be with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event finally kicked off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some activities were done on stage to entertain people. The crowd laughed, danced and had a lot of fun. But I kept thinking of the fact that I was craving chips so badly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time for the coronation reached. My cravings for chips vanished as a weighty emotion lodged in my throat</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched painfully as Jaris and Marta walked to the center of the stage,holding hands. They looked good together. I should be happy for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman, Elders and every other Alpha surrounded them. Questions were asked, rites were performed. The whole process took close to an hour,yet nobody seemed bored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At long last, Jaris was crowned Grand King-King to every other Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall went silent for a full minute as the crown was bestowed on Jaris. Following the law, everyone went on their knees and bowed their heads for a full minute,nobody even muttering a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;All hail the new King! King Jaris!&#34; Chairman Lyon announced, our cue to rise to our feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Long live King Jaris!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A certain kind of joy bloomed in my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King Jaris. Jaris was finally King!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I lived to see the day!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we rose to our feet, the ovation kicked off.The party drums rolled, sparking a chorus of claps,cheers,and jubilant yells.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Go, daddy!&#34; Xyla screamed happily beside me,jumping on her feet with her brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed heartily at the sight. Oh, how fulfilling it must be for them to witness this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The celebration was allowed for five minutes before it was cut off so the marriage rites could be done and the Grand Luna crowned. The marriage rites was very brief, just straight to the point and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A different process took place for Marta. She couldn&#39;t hide the excitement in her eyes, and from time to time,she kept stealing glances at her family who were on the other side of the VIP center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They would no doubt, be proud of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t sure Luna Isolde was in support of this.She&#39;d been keeping a straight face even before we left the Pack. I wasn&#39;t surprised because I knew she didn&#39;t like Marta, and I was sure it must&#39;ve caused a lot of argument between Jaris and her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t like Marta The woman gave her two kids. Plus, Luna Isolde was just as rude and vile as Marta-no offense. So I didn&#39;t understand why she&#39;d dislike another person for being what she was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was crowned Grand Luna, and just like it was with Jaris, everyone celebrated her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon and Xyla jumped around, giggling. The atmosphere was filled with happiness. And at some point, despite the ache in my heart, I couldn&#39;t resist a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still think she&#39;s a wrong choice, though,&#34; Maddy said beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The celebrations came to an abrupt end. This time, it wasn&#39;t the Chairman or any of the Elders that stopped but the arrival of a group of people that made my heart stop working in MY chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d recognize them anywhere. Their stern looks,tattoos, and this aura around them that screamed danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Executioners were back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why were they back?!</p>
