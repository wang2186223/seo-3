                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched from her words. If there weren&#39;t so many eyes on us, I&#39;d have yelled at her to fuck off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She smiled as she stepped away from.me, going out of the room to join the rest of the doctors watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inhaling for courage, I went closer to the patient. The moment I touched his hand, I knew what to do. What could help him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was going to be a complex surgery, but I think l could do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>OUTSIDE THE ROOM.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope this isn&#39;t a bad idea, Marta. You should&#39;ve given her something easy to start with,&#34; one of the doctors watching aired her concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s called a test for a reason, doctor Meredith.Besides,don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure she can handle it. She&#39;s quite good.&#34; Marta smiled. And between them, there was that unspoken relief hanging in the air: At least, if anything happened to the old man, his blood wouldn&#39;t be on their hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour into the surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s vitals still looked stable. So far, Lyric hadn&#39;t done a mistake to set off the alarms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She looks like she knows what she&#39;s doing,&#34;Someone remarked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. She&#39;s handling it quite well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s throat became scratchy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. There was still time. Time for Lyric to fail. No one had been able to treat Moonlit Affliction. Lyric wouldn&#39;t be the first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But another hour into the surgery and Lyric was done.The assisting doctor in the room gave the ones outside a thumbs up, she too, looking surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She did it!&#34; One of them gasped with relief. &#34;By the moon,she did heal him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s vitals looked way better than they were before the surgery. He was going to be fine!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did she do that!?&#34; One of them shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In their whole years, they&#39;d never seen anyone successfully carry out this surgery. How could the woman before them be capable of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was as pale as a ghost. She wished for the ground to open and swallow her whole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Monroe!&#34; Guinevere chuckled. &#34;You have no idea how happy I am that you brought her to this ward.You&#39;ve done a really great job! We&#39;ve found a gem!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had to be the best day of my life since I returned to the werewolf world. I was brimming with so much excitement I feared my heart would burst out of my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The doctors were extremely happy and congratulated me for getting the job. Afterwards, Guinevere took me to her office where we discussed my payment. What she was offering was quite huge-more than what I&#39;d expected. But I was more interested in the fact that I&#39;d get to save more lives like the man in there. Xylon was right. There was too much suffering in the hospital, and someone with my gift shouldn&#39;t be in hiding. As long as I don&#39;t poke my nose where it does not belong, I won&#39;t get into trouble like the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We concluded I&#39;d resume fully in three days. It&#39;d give me enough time to get prepared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On my way out, I found Marta lurking outside the office. Had she been eavesdropping on our conversation?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked nervous. Wow. For the first time, Marta looked nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;d be ungrateful if I don&#39;t thank you, Marta. If you hadn&#39;t pushed me to my limits, I wouldn&#39;t have known what I was capable of.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could see the disgust in her face. For the first time,yet again,she walked away without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****	****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, all I wanted to do was go home and have some fun. Like play music in my room, pop a bottle and drink alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t just celebrating my new job. I was also celebrating the fact that I had the power to save a man&#39;s life. I had the gift to do what others are unable to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it wasn&#39;t really a curse if I use it right. Maybe it&#39;s a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to Darkspire, however, my plans were put on halt when Kael caught up with me in the middle of the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, right. I&#39;d almost forgotten about his text this morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We exchanged pleasantries before he told me the reason he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have been running a task, and currently, I just bumped into a problem. I&#39;m supposed to get something-a kind of access from the chairman. But after meeting with him, he told me he had handed those rights over to his son.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me two seconds longer to realize what he was asking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.&#34;Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Your hot-headed ill-mannered friend.&#34; He hissed,the words dripping with venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried and failed to stifle my smile. &#34;But...now you need to ask for his help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And I think we both know your friend is too stubborn to grant me that access.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace isn&#39;t all that bad,&#34; I rolled my eyes up, looking at him from the perspective of someone who had been my best friend and defender from childhood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Lyric. Even you can see how much of an annoying bastard he is. I hate that I need his help.&#34;Kael&#39;s words oozed with hostility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I huffed at him. &#34;And you think you&#39;re the saint? Or the victim? The two times you two have been in a fight you punched him first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael looked like he&#39;d roll his eyes if he could. Jace had a problem, no doubt. But Kael was no different and didn&#39;t have the right to judge him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway,&#34; I crossed my arms. &#34;What&#39;s my role in all of this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked calmer now. &#34;I need your help setting up a meeting between us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hmph. I guess his pride wouldn&#39;t let him contact Jace himself. So, I have to be the middle woman. Well, I am definitely sensing a war coming.</p>
