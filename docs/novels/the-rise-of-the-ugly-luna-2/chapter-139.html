                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Elders were already waiting in the meeting room before | arrived. The look on their faces wasn&#39;t good at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expressed concern when I noticed Luca&#39;s state. The man was badly bruised, like he had gotten into an accident or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of what the problem might be crossed my mind, and I didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; I remained standing at the head of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Somehow, Luca looked angry at me. But it seemed he was too scared of me to act it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was attacked, Alpha Jaris. And you wouldn&#39;t believe who it was.&#34; I said nothing, prompting him to continue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone from the dead.&#34; My hand slowly curled into a fist. &#34;Your brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I experienced a profound chill deep inside,like frost settling over the warmth of my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen it coming. But getting to confirm it was another feeling on its own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression remained impassive. The Elders might easily think I don&#39;t care, but they didn&#39;t know the war taking place in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is this, Alpha Jaris?&#34; Another Elder asked. &#34;We thought your brother was dead?! We-We thought he died around the same time your father did?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, still, keeping my raging thoughts under my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden is alive,&#34; someone else scoffed.&#34;That means we&#39;re in trouble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible he was the one that got the Feeders released and has been controlling them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s been behind all these attacks!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s going to want to come for all of us! I thought we had gotten rid of this boy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I observed with a numbing rage as they talked about my brother like he was a beast. For years, that was what everyone knew him as.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden was different from a normal wolf. His wolf needed blood to survive. He wasn&#39;t just a Feeder; he was way worse than one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His claws were poisonous and could easily kill someone when scratched in the wrong spot-like the heart, the middle of the forehead and other vital parts of the body.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And the worst part? It was impossible to kill him.Unless someone of his kind did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But eight years ago, the Elders thought somehow,he&#39;d managed to be killed. They didn&#39;t know he&#39;d only been imprisoned by me and had long escaped. They had every reason to worry. Caden was a monster to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did he say to you?&#34; I asked, my gaze pinned on Luca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. He just told me it&#39;s been a long time since he saw me and was trying to say hi.&#34; I caught the guilt in the man&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Growing up, Luca had loved my brother and I. But his love for my brother started dwindling when he noticed he was more trouble than me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became worse when he felt I was smarter, stronger and had more potential.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden was, no doubt, angry that Luca supported his demise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I look better than I was hours ago when the attack happened, Jaris. I-I could&#39;ve been with my family.Who knows what he&#39;d have done to them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But how did this happen?&#34; Someone else asked.&#34;Alpha Jaris, can you explain to us how your brother is alive?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊＋＋＊＊＊＊十＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up with a heavy ache in my head, my eyes hurting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I opened my eyes, the brightness in the room attempted to blind me. I squeezed my eyes shut,whimpering from the pain I felt in my limbs and bones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands and legs felt strained and locked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Managing to adjust my eyes to the brightness of the room, I realized I was sitting on a chair,my hands behind it and my legs bound to the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into panic mood, wondering how the hell I got in this strange room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the memories came-the accident, Jaris&#39;brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped at the recollection of his brother. I thought he was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;H-Hello?&#34; I called out in the empty room, struggling with the ropes around my wrists. &#34;Is anyone there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get any response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the door was left open. Someone should&#39;ve heard me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued struggling with the binds, but it was useless. There was no way I could cut them apart without help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse fastened when I heard multiple footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, four men showed up at the door.I swallowed thickly down my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was there. I couldn&#39;t see their faces yet, but l just knew he was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would they bring me here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body hurt. I needed to see a doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They came forward. When they got to the middle of the room, the other three stood behind while the fourth one continued approaching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a small whimper. I didn&#39;t like the look of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; he drawled as he dropped to a crouch before me.&#34;Did you enjoy your sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having a close look at his face, something clicked.lt sent a cold feeling of dread down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This face... I&#39;d seen it before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silver eyes, gold hair, the small scar on his throat....</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped when the time and place clicked in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hospital in Mystopia! The unconscious man l siphoned awake; the one that led to the death of my supervisor and the Executioners coming after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was Jaris&#39; brother?! What the hell?</p>
