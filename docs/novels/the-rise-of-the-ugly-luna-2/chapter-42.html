                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was on my sixth bottle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was infuriating because I hated drinking this much. I was always in control of how much alcohol I took into my system, but tonight, I wanted it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stayed in my office for hours, replaying everything in my head. Drinking made me feel slightly better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion came in to remind me that it was too late and I probably should get some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. The good guy. It was in such situations that I missed Kael. He&#39;d have drunk with me, knowing I needed the sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, he was out, executing a task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Nerion was right. I was tired and could use some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the office for my room, and right there, on the bed was Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a red transparent night dress. I could see the small red bra she had on, and the small red pant. The dress was as good as useless because it was a see-through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was stretched and packed to one side, a red color tinting her lips. Right there, she looked like a seductress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Marta. What did I tell you?&#34; My voice was less critical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she said in a rather seducing tone as she slowly sat up, her both hands on the bed beside her waist. &#34;I have been waiting for quite a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head was a little woozy. All I wanted to do was get off this stupid suit and crash into the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing my dresser, I took off my jacket and started undoing the buttons of my black shirt. Marta stood up. &#34;I was worried and wanted to check on you.&#34; She walked toward me, taking slow, enticing steps. &#34;I don&#39;t really know what happened, but l know you&#39;re not someone who acts out without a reason.I need you to know I&#39;m here, and I&#39;m sorry for what happened.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face came into view in the mirror. She was standing behind me, watching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes on her as I took off my tie, tossed it to the bed, then took off my unbuttoned shirt next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everything will be fine,&#34; she added in hushed tones, placing her hand on my shoulder. My bare shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Angry desire flooded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitating, I spun and grabbed her, pulling her in and locking my lips on hers. She threw her arms around me, returning the kiss better than I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned us around so her back was against the dresser. My hand angrily fisted her hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed to take this out on someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, as I held and kissed Marta, all I got were forbidden images in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wet hair. Unclothed body. Full breasts. Hot legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory sent a painful message to my cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was not her. They were not the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a hard shove,I peeled myself away from Marta. She was confused and hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out.&#34; I turned away from her, my head banging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She came closer. &#34;Is there...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to leave!&#34; I snarled at her, my iris flashing red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck.What the hell? That was my wolf, wanting her gone as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was strange.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta recoiled in horror. But she didn&#39;t waste any further time. She hurriedly left the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, holding onto the dresser for support.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gaining a little composure, I pulled out the phone from my pocket and sat on the bed as I replayed the video.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was there, holding and kissing Zarek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked so horny. So desperate for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger and irritation flooded me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought she was different. She had this beautiful smile, pretty face, and a smart mouth. And the way she cared for my kids. I didn&#39;t think someone like her would be so cheap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek&#39;s text was lying just below the video. &#39;Told you I could get her in a week. She&#39;s quite cheap-just like Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anger returned in a greater fold. I groaned and thrashed the phone against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made a mockery of me. In a way I&#39;d never been mocked before! How dare she!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rubbed the heels of my palms against my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was calmer, I reached for the picture in my pocket and breathed in relief. Finally, something to keep me sane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran my fingers along the surface of the picture. My heart ached, just as much as it calmed at the sight of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never believed in love at first sight, until I met her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wish you were here. It&#39;d have made a lot of difference,&#34; I mumbled, staring wistfully at the image. LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For four days, I was indoors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only people I got to see were the maids who brought me my meals, and Xylon and Xyla who came to check on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t know what was going on. They were just surprised that I hadn&#39;t come to see them the whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too ashamed to go out, ashamed to face the people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I imagined what the rumours would be:</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Alpha left her standing at the altar until all the guests got tired and left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think he almost changed his mind, which is the reason he must have arrived late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s really sad. A lady as pretty as her almost being rejected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However,by the fifth day, I was done feeling embarrassed and came out of my shell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today,I had something important to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found something corporate to wear and kept my eyes low as I walked to my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to be strong enough to ignore what people thought about me, but it was difficult being in my shoes.Every eye felt judgy at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so relieved when I got into my car, and was even more pleased that the windows were tinted. At least,they won&#39;t get to see me anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driving, I received a call from the manager of the garden Marta and I had used that night. It brought me more relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; I put the call on handsfree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning,Mrs.Dreadmoor. I&#39;m calling in respect to your request. We&#39;ve finally gotten the approval to give you the CCTV footage you requested.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in a relieved surprise. &#34;Really?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And you were right. Someone else had entered into the garden that night.&#34;</p>
