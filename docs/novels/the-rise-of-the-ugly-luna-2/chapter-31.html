                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, I left to grab my belongings. Coincidentally, Jace had come around to deliver something to father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father was thrilled when I told him of my plan to move to Darkspire. It served as a kind of assurance that the contract was going through, and he&#39;d have nothing to worry about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for Jace, he insisted on accompanying me to Darkspire. In his words, he wanted to help me move in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told him about Jaris&#39; new rules, but he didn&#39;t seem to care. Seeing that he was stubborn, I decided to call Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, believe me when I say Jace is merely a friend. He means no harm and only wants to help.&#34; I tried to sound as convincing as I could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By some miracle, he approved of it. Hm. Jaris Dreadmoor was showing a different side of him today, and I think I prefer this side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace helped me gather my things while teasing me about my new role.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Make sure you don&#39;t get pregnant. I know Jaris is awfully handsome, and there&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;s quite big down there.But your contract is only for a year, Ly. Trust me, you don&#39;t wanna end up with a baby all by yourself,&#34; Jace said as he folded some clothes into my luggage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. Well, I did know what Jaris looked and felt like down there. He was the first man I ever had,and it was the best feeling I&#39;d felt in a while.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;ll be no sex between us,&#34; I told Jace as I dusted my shoes.He made that perfectly clear in the contract. No form of intimacy, no catching feelings... nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the baby part, I already had two and lost them. I didn&#39;t want to relive that pain. &#34;That is what every woman says until a man tickles their ear and tells them how beautiful they are.&#34; Jace casually said, and I threw a pillow at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finished packing up my things, he helped me take them to the car with the aid of some guards while I spoke to Father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do we do with Roderick? The ceremony&#39;s in a few days. Right now, I can&#39;t breach the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. I know, Lyric.&#34; Father looked troubled. &#34;I&#39;ll try to get to Roderick today. If he doesn&#39;t cooperate, I&#39;ll have to seek extra help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told him to act fast because I didn&#39;t trust Roderick anymore since he was now aware of my engagement with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I drove to Darkspire. I was shown to my room, and my belongings were taken in for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace helped me make some extra arrangements in the room, though I didn&#39;t think it was needed. The room was quite large, well-furnished, and very beautiful. It was far more beautiful than what I had in Ravencrest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you so much, Jace. You didn&#39;t have to go through this stress,&#34; I told him when he rounded up with the last wallpaper he was fixing on the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, don&#39;t mention, Ly. You&#39;re like a daughter to me. I got to do this for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit him on the back, earning an &#39;ouch&#39; and a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afterward, we decided to take a walk around the Pack before he left. It was already evening, and his Pack was quite far away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came across a big room that resembled a bar and went in. There were a few people there, drinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We could see their wine collections at the counter, and it was a whole lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. I must say Darkspire has got good taste.&#34; Jace said with a nod as we walked toward the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, we requested a scotch whiskey.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How much does it cost?&#34; Jace asked, dipping his hand into his back pocket. &#34;You don&#39;t have to pay for these. They&#39;re free to every member of Darkspire,&#34; the bartender said, surprising me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I exchanged a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, this is an attribute of a real pack!&#34; He laughed. &#34;If I&#39;d known I&#39;d be getting free drinks every day, I&#39;d have found a way to become a member long ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. These drinks were expensive. Giving it out to hundreds of people daily for free...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Darkspire must have a lot of money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our shots were served, but Jace wanted something more. He was pointing at certain drinks on the counter when I turned to the door and found Marta approaching, a young lady beside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. Kill-joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t look away when her eyes found mine. But I did notice something else. When Jace turned slightly to ask me a question, and Marta caught a glimpse of his face, she stopped walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace looked away, continuing his conversation with the bartender. But Marta looked like she&#39;d seen a ghost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted open. Quickly, she turned around and scurried out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In seconds, she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? My brows furrowed in confusion. What was so wrong with her? Was Jace the reason she had that reaction? Or was it something else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finished placing his order and properly faced me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, do you know-&#34; I was interrupted by my phone ringing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of ignoring it. But when I noticed it was Roderick,I excused myself to take the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Roderick. I want to believe you&#39;re calling to ask me to meet you at the temple.&#34; I looked around the balcony to ensure there was no one around. &#34;Spare me the drama, Lyric. When were you going to tell me you were engaged to Jaris?&#34; He sounded pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?Was he insane?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And why do I need to tell you anything? You have no position in my life, Roderick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damnit! Stop saying that!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roderick was furious. He had the right to be furious because I was engaged to Jaris? Oh! He was a joker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He doesn&#39;t know wve&#39;re still bonded, does he?&#34; He grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not bonded! We already rejected each other five years ago! As soon as that little stepis completed-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It is never getting completed, Lyric. And you know you can&#39;t be with someone else if we aren&#39;t through. It&#39;s forbidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes! Which is why we&#39;ll be breaking the bond before the ceremony.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed. The asshole actually laughed like it was funny.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, this is what will happen,&#34; the laughter was gone from his voice. &#34;You have until the end of today to tell Jaris the truth and end things with him. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll come over myself tomorrow and spill the beans.Trust me, I&#39;ll make it more embarrassing. What do you think the people of Darkspire would think when they learn you were trying to become their Luna while bonded to another? It&#39;ll make you look desperate, Lyric.And I don&#39;t think Jaris would want to be associated with a woman like that. So, I&#39;m giving you the opportunity to make this less humiliating.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart swelled with rage. I wanted to punch Roderick in the jaw. I wanted to see him beaten to a pulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck off!&#34; I growled into the phone and angrily dropped the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh! I hate him! How did I ever feel a thing for him before now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly called father to give himan update. He was pissed as he was worried and told me he was going to contact the Priestess at the temple tonight. We were still talking when suddenly, I heard noises coming from the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the call without bidding bye to father as I rushed toward the bar, thinking about Jace.</p>
