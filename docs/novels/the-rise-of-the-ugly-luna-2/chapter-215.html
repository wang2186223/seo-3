                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I knew your mother very welI. She was fierce and so full of life. She was one of the best Lunas Darkspire ever had. It&#39;s unfair that her life gets taken from her like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The people have grown more agitated knowing the Siphon is still around. They feel the Luna was unjustly killed by her and any of them could easily fall victim.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was warned never to use her powers wrongly.And clearly, she just did that. She shouldn&#39;t go unpunished!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head ached the more I listened to them. For some reason, I wanted to growl at them, claw at their necks and rip their hearts out for bringing this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated it. I hated it so fucking much! &#34;That&#39;s enough talking,&#34; I cut one of them off, hoping my irritation wasn&#39;t too obvious. &#34;I understand your concerns, but I need you to know that I have things under control. Lyric will definitely be punished for what she did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When?&#34; Someone dared to ask. &#34;She&#39;s been locked up for a week now. What if she escapes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinched my brows, my emotions getting harder to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Jaris,&#34; Lucas adjusted in his seat. &#34;We understand how this may be difficult for you.Actually, if we were in your shoes, we&#39;d also find it hard passing judgement on our beloved. We pity you in all of these. Which is why we&#39;ve come up with the best solution. We&#39;ve decided to hand her over to the Executioners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An alarm sounded in my thoughts, crisp and frigid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My glare was sharp as I looked up at Lucas, wild thoughts running through my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hurt him. Hurt him. Hurt him. My subconsciousness screamed at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But another Elder spoke. &#34;It wasn&#39;t easy coming up with this decision, My King. Lyric used to be a sweet woman.But we&#39;ve gotten to see how dangerous she can be as well as the reason her kind was forbidden in the first place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d suggest we act fast before more of her people come to save her. You know a group of Siphons are unbeatable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be taking a vote now to see those who are interested in this motion,&#34; Lucas said as he raised his hand. &#34;If you&#39;re in support, can I see your hand up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grounded my teeth when everyone on the table raised their hands. Not a single hand was down; not even Chairman Lyon who had been mostly quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They lowered their hands and looked at me as though the final ball was in my court. Like there was much I could do now that they were all united on this judgement. The doors opened behind me. I was bowed over in disbelief when I turned and found the Executioners walking in. What the hell?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cole kept his triumphant eyes on me as he made his way forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;King Jaris,&#34; they all bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands tightened further into fists.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders have keptus in the loop already, and need you to understand we only aim to mmake things better for everyone.&#34; He shrugged. &#34;You know, I hate to say I actually warned you. Too bad you had to learn with the loss of someone important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Executioners are here, Lyric. The Elders made an unanimous decision to hand you over to them,&#34;Jace spoke in hushed worried tones from outside my cell My head was leaning against the wall from the floor where I sat, my finger drawing invisible lines on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric! Did you just hear a word I said?&#34; Jace snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I calmly looked at him. &#34;I did. You just said I&#39;m going to die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell are you feeling so unbothered about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because nothing can be done, Jace. Jaris is never going to forgive me for killing his mother-even if I&#39;m innocent. And the people will never trust me again.No one will be able to get me out of this. Besides,&#34;my voice dropped to a mumble. &#34;What&#39;s the point of living anyway?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, stop that. We need to get out of here. Don&#39;t you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can go on, Jace. Where can I possibly go? Of what use is it when my life is already a mess?&#34; A short lull pierced the conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, that&#39;s it? You&#39;re just going to give up? Is that how easy it is for you?&#34; His words were coated with disappointment, but I didn&#39;t look at him. &#34;I understand the pain of losing the baby, but you seem to be forgetting that you have two more kids, Lyric.So, what happens when Penelope regains her memory? Don&#39;t you care about your kids anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, that was one thing that struck me. I looked upward as his words registered in me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. I had two more kids I still hadn&#39;t met yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do l do, Jace?&#34; I whimpered, a tear rolling down my cheek. &#34;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m getting out of here.We both know it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I promised I&#39;d keep you safe. That&#39;s exactly what I intend to do. No matter what, Lyric, I&#39;m getting you out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十 JACE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nervously paced the room, wondering when the door would go open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From time to time, he&#39;d go to the window to check if he was already in sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it!&#34; He picked up his phone to call him. That was when the door opened and Kael made his way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell, man? I called you like thirty minutes ago,&#34; he grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had a lot of things to take care of. I actually don&#39;t have much time here. What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace scoffed as he took some steps back. &#34;Are you trying to tell me you&#39;re busy for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Jace. Let&#39;s not make this an issue, okay?I&#39;m just telling you I&#39;m having a really busy day. Now,what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still upset, Jace ran his knuckles over his jaw. &#34;I need your help,&#34; he sighed, knowing Kael was the only help he could get. &#34;You should know what l need. I can&#39;t let Lyric be handed to the Executioners.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael exhaled. &#34;Believe me, J, I&#39;ve tried to talk with Jaris. He just isn&#39;t opening up to anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, no. I&#39;m not talking about Jaris. I know he won&#39;t be of much help. I&#39;m talking about actually getting her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael said nothing, just kept his face blank as he pinned Jace with a stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, you have to help me. We need to get her out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? You want me to help you break her out?&#34; He chuckled. &#34;You know, I knew this was the reason you called.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. So, are you going to help me or not?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What you&#39;re asking is insane, J! You&#39;re asking me to betray Jaris.&#34; &#34;No, I&#39;m asking you to save an innocent lady from death.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, you really need to stop with this who talk of her being innocent. A Siphon killed the Luna!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I&#39;m telling you, it wasn&#39;t her!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you believe her? Simply because she said she didn&#39;t do it? Well, she&#39;s your best friend, you&#39;ll take her word any day. You know sometimes, I think you trust Lyric more than you do me.&#34;</p>
