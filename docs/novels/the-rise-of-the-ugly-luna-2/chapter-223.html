                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I masked my pain and shock as I watched him take a napkin, dabbing the corner of his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He threw the napkin back on the table and focused his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But I&#39;m not just using you, Lyric. I&#39;m protecting you. I&#39;ll keep you safe, healthy, powerful. You&#39;ll never have to worry about a single thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;Powerful?&#34; I glanced around with mockery in my eyes. &#34;By what? Making your suckers greet me every morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Some seconds passed before he spoke again. &#34;I&#39;m building an empire, Lyric. My plan is already in motion.Soon, I&#39;ll be King of my own empire, and I&#39;m offering to make you my Queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I arched my brows at hm, panic starting to set in. &#34;What plans are you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave his devilish grin. &#34;Why don&#39;t you wait for the results, darling? I wouldn&#39;t want to bore you with the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I suddenly remembered Kael telling me a lot of things had been happening around there. Was Caden causing some sort of havoc over there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What I want between us is quite simple. I&#39;ll keep you by my side as my siphon. This way, people would be afraid to even lie to me. You know you could torture people in unimaginable ways, right? Just imagine how awful it would be if someone&#39;s oxygen is being sucked out of them. You could take it away so slowly they&#39;d want to do anything to get you to stop. You&#39;d also be available to provide instant and effective healing to my men in case of poisoning or severe injury. The things you will do, Lyric...&#34; he tsked. &#34;We&#39;ll be a powerful combo. Can you imagine that? If you stay with me, no one will dare to hurt you. My Empire will worship you.You&#39;ll be more than you ever were with Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned forward, his eyes locked on mine. &#34;What do you say? Are you willing to rule the world with me?&#34; I scoffed, shaking my head. I couldn&#39;t believe he had everything mapped out already. How exactly did he plan on building his empire?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been hurting Jaris?&#34; My tone was lowered,stemming from hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve told you, Lyric; you don&#39;t have to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think after everything, I&#39;d simply side with you? I don&#39;t want to be a part of your sick empire,Caden. I know you&#39;ve saved me twice, but you wouldn&#39;t have if you didn&#39;t have this plan for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened. &#34;Oh, really? Shouldn&#39;t you be thankful I have a plan for you? I mean, where was your so-called love when I was the one saving you? Oh, yes-he&#39;s actually the one hunting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words struck a nerve, but I wasn&#39;t ready to give him the satisfaction of seeing me hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s so special about that son of a bitch, anyway? It&#39;s not like he&#39;s any different from me. He&#39;s always been a monster; only difference is he finds a way to glorify his.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I locked eyes with him for a while, letting him see the disappointment in mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to know why Jaris will always be different from you?&#34; I dropped my cutleries and leaned back in my seat. &#34;It&#39;s because he never saw my Siphoning powers as a tool despite knowing about it for months.It&#39;s because he&#39;s angry at me because he thinks I killed his mother. You think there&#39;s not much difference between both of you? Oh,please,&#34; I scoffed. &#34;You&#39;ve not even asked me if I really killed your mother or not.You&#39;re not interested in any way or affected by her death.&#34; I chuckled. &#34;Is it clear now, Caden? How different Jaris is from you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no trace of amusement in his gaze. Silence enveloped us for a while before he put his hands across his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t said anything about my offer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The answer is no. I never want to be your side. As a matter of fact,&#34; I stood up. &#34;I don&#39;t want to be here.So,let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my gaze for some time. Slowly, a smile slipped through. A dark one that always made him look like a lunatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m winning this war, Lyric. You wouldn&#39;t want to be on the losing side when that happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;You can burn the world for all I care, Caden. I&#39;ll never stand by you and watch it burn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started toward the door, expecting the guards to stop me even before they got in the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Take her back to her room,&#34; Caden ordered them, prompting them to grab my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t keep me here against my will! You need to let me go, Caden! Fucking let me go!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning dead ears to my pleas, they took me upstairs and locked me back in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My fingers angrily tapped against the table as I listened to the phone beep. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever have a reason to give the mongrel a call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother,&#34; HHis voice was a pain to my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tightened my hand around the phone, restraining myself from cursing at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief pause. &#34;Are you... referring to your mate? Oh! She&#39;s right here with me. She&#39;s doing great and resting in her room at the moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I told you never to lay a hand on her again? You don&#39;t just listen, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold up, brother,&#34; he laughed. &#34;You don&#39;t think I&#39;m hurting her, do you? Lyric is grateful I saved her.As a matter of fact, we just finished having lunch not long ago. Hold on, I have proof.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The phone beeped with a new message. My forehead was crinkled as I checked it out. To my surprise, Lyric was on the dining with him, actually eating. She didn&#39;t look forced or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment seemed to stretch, making it feel like I&#39;d been staring at the picture for an eternity. &#34;See? She&#39;s doing just great. We&#39;re doing just great. You can&#39;t really blame her, you know? You and your people have been hunting the poor woman for a week. She&#39;s bound to stick to anyone who&#39;s like a savior to her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered myself to my seat, swiping the picture away and trying to get it out of my head. Only that it was so difficult. Did Lyric willingly choose to be with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If that&#39;ll be all, I have important things to do, brother. Take care.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute after the call ended, I still remained mute, unable to believe it. My heart hurt so much it was hard to breathe. Why was everything falling apart?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was restless for the rest of the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continuously paced the room, trying to think of the best way to get out of this mess. I&#39;d checked the windows already. Unfortunately, they were too high; there was no way I could jump out of them being a wolf-less wolf that I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only way out of here was through the front door, and of course, Caden and his men were never letting me out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reached for my phone, hoping I could reach out to someone for help. The battery had been down since l was brought here, and I didn&#39;t have a means to get it charged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned it on, hoping I could quickly make use of it before it shut down completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as it came on, a new message caught my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows drew together in concern as I read the text from an unsaved number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Lyric, call me. It&#39;s Penelope. I remember the kids now. I gave them to Marta.</p>
