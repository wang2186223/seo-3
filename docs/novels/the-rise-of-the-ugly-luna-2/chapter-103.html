                <p>&#34;Oh, now it makes sense. She&#39;s that lady from the hotel!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What hotel are you talking about?&#34; Her grandmother insisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta shook her head, not wanting to narrate the story in front of Penelope. She never told her family the story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years before she got the twins, she had to do a lot to stay by Jaris&#39; side. That included getting rid of any bitch that might get his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were times when Jaris would be really pissed and wanted to take it out in bed on someone, but he had developoed a certain dislike for Marta and hardly touched her. So, he&#39;d go for other girls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta kept a tab on him and knew all about his movements without him knowing. She knew when he met the ugly girl at the bar and took her to his hotel But unlike him, he stayed the night. That was what bothered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was even more surprised when she contacted the hotel and they told her Jaris was booking for another day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to make a quick plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, something urgent happened in the pack that was enough to make him leave the hotel in a hurry. Then, she bribed one of the staff to get the ugly thing to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta didn&#39;t bother to know more about the girl. After all, it was the last time Jaris ever saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, how did she get pregnant from a one-night intercourse? Did she do it on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to find her,&#34; she placed her palm against her forehead. &#34;We must do whatever it takes to find her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十十****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just finished from my shift at TCH and was at the ground floor heading to the exit when I heard someone call me from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me! Doctor Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped walking and turned around to see one of the securities holding a wrapped box in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was just on my way to your office. This came in for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had my brows furrowed as I looked at it. A prosont for me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who sent it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled as he answered, &#34;Alpha Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart nosedived. What the hell? Jaris was sending me gifts?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stretch as I stared at the present without touching it. What was he playing at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s been two days since I left his Pack. He was no doubt, disappointed with the way I handled things when he came to father&#39;s pack, and since he left, I hadn&#39;t heard from him again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated the deep feeling of loneliness | felt. But I wasn&#39;t ready to forget what happened. I still felt insulted and ashamed each time I remembered his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell him I don&#39;t need it,&#34; I replied with a chill in my voice,then turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got into my car and drove off to meet with Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****	**** JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She rejected it,&#34; Kael whispered in my ear before he stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands clenched into fists as I forced myself to remember the fact that I was in a meeting and there were so many eyes on me. I couldn&#39;t act out in front of all these people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But damn Lyric for giving me a hard time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What exactly did she want, huh? For the first time I was getting her a gift and she dared to reject it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fine, I was wrong. I hurt her feelings with my words and did go a litte too far. But what else did I have to do to get her forgiveness?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I even had to go to her father&#39;s Pack to try and bring her back. I forgave the fact she was rude to me in front of others. Now I was sending her presents. What more did she want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This case looks too familiar,&#34; one of the elders tsked,shaking his head. &#34;If they&#39;re really sucking the blood of wolves, it only means it&#39;s the Feeders. They&#39;re back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That can&#39;t be. It&#39;s been nine years already. I thought they were trapped and could never be released?&#34; I pinched the bridge of my nose, hating this conversation already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to bring it up after Zarek told me Lyric had been attacked by another group of those suckers. It was time to face reality. The threat was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think they must have found a way to break out,&#34; I said to them. &#34;Right now, if it&#39;s truly them, we have to find a way to put them in order.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You speak like it&#39;s easy to do. You hadn&#39;t been Alpha ten years ago, but I think you should&#39;ve heard about the destruction they caused, Jaris, and how difficult it had been I put them down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was tempted to laugh at the elder that had just spoken to me. They thought I didn&#39;t know a thing?They were actualy the ones that didn&#39;t know nothing about what happened ten years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who did they think put the suckers down in the first place? Who got rid of my stupid brother who was always leading them on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone just woke up one day and discovered their problems were gone, and they thought they went away on their own? I did so much to make those problems go away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I understand how serious and dangerous it is,&#34; I relaxed even more in my chair. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t bring it here if I didn&#39;t. But more of our people are going to die if we don&#39;t get it handled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meetng lasted for almost an hour. Everyone kept throwing in suggestions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Feeders were the wolves&#39; nemesis. The reason they were quite strong was due to the fact that they sucked off the blood of other wolves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were a rare species that started existing on earth only a thousand years ago. When they were newly discovered, their kind was killed off as much as possible. They went into extinction, but they kept reproducing, and over the years,kept coming back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were dangerous to the wolves. Very dangerous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elders decided to pass an information to every other Pack, telling them to put out more security measures in place. If most of Feeders got killed,perhaps, it would stop the others from bothering us for now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These were the kind of situations the Alpha King handled.Now,more than ever, the wolves needed one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we finished the discussion of the Feeders,they brought it up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The second trial is a week from now, Alpha Jaris.&#34; Luca said with a smile. &#34;You were amazing on the first trail. I have no doubt you&#39;ll do just fine on this one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nodded. &#34;Looking forward to it, Luca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now more than ever, I needed to win this position.With the Feeders back, and my brother, the throne needed someone like me on it. Someone that knew very much about them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help but be grateful that Zarek&#39;s stupid ploy had pushed me into the game.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the entire discussion, I never disclosed any information on my brother. Everyone believed he was dead-I made sure of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all knew how dangerous he was. If they knew he was back and likely controlling this Feeders...it wouldn&#39;t end well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting was already drawing to an end when she walked in. Selestia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at her in surprise as she made her way in,her eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Selestia? Do you need something?&#34; One of the elders asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shs wasn&#39;t supposed to be here. Usually,her pace was in her small cottage where she preferred living. Selestia was a seventy-five year old woman who barely looked fifty. She was the Pack&#39;s seer. Although,with age, her sight seemed to be getting limited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she was young, she used to be pretty good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; she stopped in front of me, her hands on her thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a long green dress that covered her feet, her hair stylishly wrapped in a scarf, two big earrings on her ear. Selestia was, no doubt, very hot and beautiful when she was young. It could still be seen even in her old age.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She kept her both hands on her thighs as she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When will you tell them the truth?&#34;</p>
