                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here I was, thinking this day couldn&#39;t get any worse for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nervously twiddled with the fabric of my shirt, trying to conjure the best possible lies in my head. I was already in too much mess with Jaris to add this to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Care to explain?&#34; His voice was stone cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness,he was beyond pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips moved, but no words formed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you trying to run away?&#34; He took a step toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I promise, it&#39;s not what you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not what I think.&#34; He chuckled. &#34;Well, your bags are here on the floor, all packed up. And it&#39;s night. So,maybe you want to explain what&#39;s going on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit. He was never supposed to see this. No one was.I&#39;d left the room in a hurry and didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be that unfortunate. &#34;What is wrong with you!?&#34; He growled. &#34;First, you do unexplainable things, and now this? You&#39;re trying to run away from our contract? Why? Do you have someone you&#39;d rather be with? Have you had a lover all along?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared at me like he had a name at the of his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I said rather wearily. &#34;I know what it looks like, but I wasn&#39;t trying to flee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, he had every reason to suspect me.It did look like I was trying to flee. But how do I explain to him that I&#39;d changed my mind? How do I even explain why I&#39;d been trying to flee in the first place? It wouldn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was so pissed. He looked at me like I&#39;d betrayed him. It was almost like that night at the temple when he glared at me like I was his enemy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And here I was, thinking you cared for my kids. For my son,&#34; he said low, his voice filled with disappointment. &#34;We had an agreement for you to help them. Yet, you&#39;re willing to run away just for some other selfish interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I wasn&#39;t going to let him do this to me. His kids were the reason I was staying. I was risking my life for them! &#34;I love your kids! They&#39;re the reason you still met me here!&#34; | snapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes darkened. &#34;So, you do admit that you were trying to flee, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! The emotional manipulation dawned on me when it was too late. Ugh! Jaris was a vermin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took my phone from my table, surprising me. Then,he walked past me, going toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you need my phone for?&#34; I asked,confused,but he didn&#39;t even look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m really sorry. It&#39;s not what you think.&#34;|couldn&#39;t believe I was apologizing to him for something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, I was wrong. But he&#39;d hurt me as well and didn&#39;t even bother to explain himself like I have.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say a word as he reached the door, pulled out my key and walked out the front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were icier as they pinned me with a glare.&#34;Punishing  you. Keeping you locked here so you never think of this stupid idea, ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No! He couldn&#39;t be serious!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do that to me.&#34; I started toward the door,but it was slammed shut in my face, and I heard the sound of the key going in next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned the knob but the door wouldn&#39;t open. I was really trapped in here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open the door!&#34; I hit my palms against it, repeatedly &#34;I&#39;m not your prisoner! You can&#39;t do this to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no response came. Instead, I heard his receding footsteps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For two whole days, I was locked in my room by Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have access to my phone to call anyone, so l was stuck here at his will.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only time I got to see people was when the maids came with food and drinks, and each time, there would be two guards at the door, making sure I didn&#39;t try to leave. They wouldn&#39;t even talk to me. I guess Jaris must have warned them not to so I wouldn&#39;t try to talk my way out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was frustrated and losing my mind. But I couldn&#39;t say I was  surprised. Everyone had always talked about Jaris being an emotionless monster. Unfortunately,I didn&#39;t have a choice in this stupid contract.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I heard the door going open in the evening,I figured it&#39;d be one of the maids bringing me some snacks or something. Surprisingly, I was well taken care of. But it didn&#39;t change the fact that | was a prisoner, and I hated it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unexpectedly, I found Jace walking through the door.Surprise filled my lungs in the form of a gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He opened his arms and I ran right in, feeling like an abandoned wolf who was finally meeting her family</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How-How did you get access?&#34; Jaris wouldn&#39;t let me see anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, I caught Kael by the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The bastard owed me a favour,&#34; Jace clarified</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And that bastard is gonna fuck you up if you don&#39;t make it quick,&#34; Kael grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace tilted himself so he could face Kael. &#34;I really pity you when you have too much confidence in yourself.You can&#39;t fuck me up, dude. Get lost.&#34; &#34;Right. You keep saying that and someday, you mnight learn the hard way.&#34; Kael shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head. These two could never agree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for coming to see me,&#34; my eyes were sad despite the smile I forced on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck is going on, Lyric? You never showed up, and I couldn&#39;t even reach you on phone. And when I came here, that fucker told me you were locked up.Good thing he owed me a favor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned away from Jace, sinking my fingers into my hair. I told him what happened; how Jaris had caught me leaving. As expected, he was enraged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And so fucking what? You&#39;re not his slave, Lyric. He has no right to lock you up,&#34; he fumed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s actually a breach of contract.&#34; He has the right to do worse to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, spare me. This is nonsense. I could talk to my father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace,please don&#39;t. I don&#39;t wanna complicate things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat down on the edge of the bed, staring at my non -manicurerd nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| actually don&#39;t want to leave again. I just didn&#39;t have the time to tell you that night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace looked at me like I&#39;d just told him | was committing suicide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you saying, Lyric? Don&#39;t be stupid! These people are on your tail and will kill you when they find you. You can&#39;t be serious about staying back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t leave the kids, Jace! On that night, while I was gathering my bags, the boy had one of his crises again.This time, it was worse. If I hadn&#39;t been there to save him...&#34; I shook my head, a chill running down my spine from the mental image of how much Xylon would&#39;ve suffered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ll never be able to bear it if something happens to that boy when I could&#39;ve been there to save him. That would have been selfish of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s voice was softer now. &#34;Lyric, it&#39;s not selfish if you&#39;re trying to survive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I know. But I need to be there for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right now, it was beyond what Jaris and I shared. Jaris and Marta aside, the kids had become my friends and I wanted to be there for them.</p>
