                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A lot of people here have thrown in a good word for you,&#34; he went on. &#34;But like I said, this simply can&#39;t be ignored. And for this-&#34; he drew out a printed paper from the file in front of him. &#34;-you&#39;ve been suspended from the hospital for three weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went numb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped beating for a second as I tried to process the words he just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t say I&#39;d been fired. He didn&#39;t say | was suspended for three years, or three months. But three weeks? Did he really say that or was it just me imagining things?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the people whispered amongst themselves,I knew I hadn&#39;t imagined anything. I was suspended for three weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tears I was holding back came flowing. But this time, they were from how shocked I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Effective today, Lyric Dreadmoor, you&#39;re not allowed to step foot in TCH for the next three weeks.&#34; The President went on talking but I wasn&#39;t even listening anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked to my right where Jaris was seated and he was staring right at me. Did he do this. Of course,why was I even asking?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head at him, not knowing what to say.Why did he do this for me? I should&#39;ve been fired. Or if I was being suspended, it&#39;d have been nothing short of months. Three weeks sounded like a vacation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the President was done talking and adjoined the meeting, I stood up with my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so sorry for those who feel disappointed in me.But I assure you, I didn&#39;t do this. I&#39;ve always been very careful with the patients, and that day, I know I gave them Calmizol, not Thilax. I promise, when I return, I&#39;ll do much better. But I&#39;m still hopeful, though, that I&#39;d get vindicated on this very case.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all stared intently at me but didn&#39;t say a word.I nodded at Jaris and he got on his feet and we went for the door together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears streaked my cheeks as we walked outside.I may have gotten the softest penalty, but it didn&#39;t change the fact that those people were dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we stepped outside, I came face-to-face with Marta. She was supposed to be in the meeting since she was a Superior,and judging from the hurried steps she was taking,she must actually be on her way in, thinking the meeting was still on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw us. And while she was busy being her dramatic self, something else clicked in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me at once-the threat she&#39;d made.She told me to my face that she was going to make me pay for what Jace and I did. How did I forget?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris.&#34; She dipped her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Jaris could get a response out, I was on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me from head to toe, like I was some mad lady in front of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t falling for her tricks. Not today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you swap those tags by any means just so l could be in this trouble?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed. &#34;Lyric, please. What is this now? You looking for someone to put the blame on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you answer me?!&#34; I yelled at her. The door opened with some people coming out of the board room. But I didn&#39;t even look at them. I was too furious at the fact that Marta would take innocent lives just to get back at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You told me you&#39;d get back at me for what Jace and I did. You warned he about it. Was this it? Was this your way of paying back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; Jaris called as he held my hand, but I didn&#39;t even look at him. Every inch of me was starting to shake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re insane if you think I&#39;d ever endanger people&#39;s lives for a stupid game,&#34; Marta snared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. That makes you the insane one, Marta. How could you be so cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this, Lyric! Stop trying to pin your foolishness on me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My foolishness?&#34; I took a step back as I laughed so hard. Though tears shun in my eyes. &#34;You think I&#39;m being foolish, Marta? Do we need to tell them how many times you&#39;ve lied in this facility? Like the time you lied about treating Mr. Owen, knowing fully well you did nothing? Or the one time you lied about Mr.Pete? Remember he didn&#39;t acknowledge you as the one who treated him. That was enough to get you in trouble, but I lied and still covered your ass.&#34; Her lips dropped open, the shock in her face unmistakable. She looked at the doctors stepping out of the room, then back at me. I didn&#39;t need to look at them to know they must be pretty shocked about my revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stepped closer to Marta. &#34;You can never do the things I can, Marta. You might be good in your own way, but you know I&#39;m way better, and that is what kills you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re insane,&#34; she spat at me. &#34;You really need to get your head checked, Lyric, because I think you&#39;ve lost it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand moved faster than my brain. It went right to her face, striking her hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gasp was so loud, I couldn&#39;t distinguish it from that of the others around us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr.Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do this here!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know who was talking to me, but the shock and pain in Marta&#39;s face was all I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How dare you?&#34; Her voice shook with rage. &#34;How fucking dare you?!&#34; She tried to come at me, but I was faster than her, pushed her back and slapped her again. This time, she screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The others intervened. Some of the doctors held Marta while some held me back. But it was Jaris&#39; hold that truly mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand was tight around my arm as he pulled me away from the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving. Right now,&#34; he whispered in my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t fight him. It may not be enough for what Marta did,but at least,she got something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He walked me out of the building and right into the car. It wasn&#39;t until I was settled in the backseat that the tears came freely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Lyric. Did you have to do that in there?&#34;Jaris asked. But there was no reprimand in his voice.He didn&#39;t even try to stop me when I hit her the first time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion was already in the driver&#39;s seat, and Kael got in not long after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are we good to go?&#34; He turned slightly to ask Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave the go-head nod and they started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Marta,&#34; I whimpered, my arms wrapped around myself,my head turned toward the window. &#34;She lured me to the garden that night. T-Told me she wanted to talk about the kids. I dozed off while I was drinking with her, and when I woke up, she was gone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was so much pain in my voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was he. It&#39;s always been her.&#34;</p>
