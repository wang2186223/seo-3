                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned to leave, I took off in a pursuit. &#34;Fine!Let&#39;s talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t break his stride or spare me a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damnit. All he made were threats and I was already losing my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, I&#39;m sorry. Alright? I was just pissed over what happened with the guy from the club. And-And the fact that I couldn&#39;t terminate the contract. I felt tricked. I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have reacted the way l did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he still didn&#39;t look at me. Damn him, he was as hard as rock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the entrance of the hall, he went in without sparing as little as a glance at me. And in that moment, I knew I was fucked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t enjoy a thing from the rest of the funeral.All I wanted was for it to come to an end so I could run to my hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Or maybe I could go now. That way, I&#39;d get to escape whatever Jaris had planned for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, a part of me was still scared to leave without his knowledge or permission or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rumors were not complete. Jaris was a bigtime manipulator. Knew how to mess with people&#39;s heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes on him all through the party, watching how detached he was from everyone he met.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked so different from the man I&#39;d slept with five years ago. Had he simply pretended that night to get me to his bed? What went wrong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear was one of the most effective forms of punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew that was what Lyric was experiencing,and it brought me a strange sense of satisfaction. And I wasn&#39;t even done with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had ever disobeyed me. I wasn&#39;t about to let her make a habit of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel her eyes on me, following my every move like a hawk. If we weren&#39;t in a public gathering, I was sure she&#39;d have run after me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My blissful moment was soon interrupted by the arrival of two unpleasant guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek and Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were holding hands, trying to wear their perfect smiles as they walked toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek Callahan. Alpha of one of the top ten ranking Packs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a normal day, we weren&#39;t supposed to have any problems. But the issues between Zarek and I were beyond personal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris,&#34; he gave a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing, sipping from my glass. After all,there were other Alphas he could talk to beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been, Jaris? I assume the news of the King&#39;s death must have hit you really hard.&#34; He continued talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I was irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thaddeus was not my personal King. He was a king to every one of us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I spoke, the smile Chloe had been forcing on her face vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pain was there, very clear now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe that after five years ago, she still hadn&#39;t gotten over it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34; Zarek nodded. &#34;He was a king to us all. Tell me, who do you think is fit to replace him?&#34; I chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, truly, it was admirable. How hard he was trying to act normal like he still wasn&#39;t pissed about the fact that his current mate hadn&#39;t chosen me over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years ago, Chloe had been madly in love with me, despite knowing I had no intention of being with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We only had sex for one night, and she didn&#39;t want to let me go. She rejected Zarek who was in love with her, just so she could be with me. She hoped that someday, I&#39;d get to choose her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But in the end, I had to force her to leave. I wasn&#39;t interested in keeping a woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since then, Zarek had been furious with me for bedding the girl he loved. But I still couldn&#39;t understand how it was any fault of mine. In my defense, yes he loved her, but she didn&#39;t love him and wanted me. Besides, they weren&#39;t mated yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am sure there are many more people that would be delighted to have that conversation with you, Zarek.&#34;I emptied the wine in my glass. &#34;For me, I totally have no interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the glass down, I walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If there was a good thing about me, it was how accurate my instincts could be sometimes.Something in me told me that little scared Lyric would want to run for the heels after my threat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,she wasn&#39;t the only one who kept an eye out for me. I did the same. And the moment I realized she was missing,I left the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It didn&#39;t take me long to find her scurrying toward the direction of the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using my Alpha speed, I reached her in three seconds, blocking her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, startled. What? Shouldn&#39;t she be used to things like these? &#34;Going somewhere, Lyric?&#34; I taunted her. &#34;We&#39;re not done yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes that were always spitting fire now looked frightened. Wow. Lyric Harper, tongue-tied. Quite the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t make empty threats, Ly. And I never forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; there was a slight tremor in her voice.&#34;Just...Just let it go. Okay? I promise you,no more disobedience.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I halted my steps. She was scared. Like, really scared. Her eyes were glossy, like she wanted to cry.I hadn&#39;t even touched her yet. Hadn&#39;t told her what plan I had in mind. Yet, she was already shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This meant one thing; she was used to being hurt by others. This fear wasn&#39;t just because I&#39;d threatened her,but because she was afraid of the usual pain that came with her being hurt all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost felt pity for her. Almost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t go back on my threas, unfortunately. Instead, I ended up with a lesser punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I still can&#39;t let you go. I need a way to make you feel pain, Lyric; so you&#39;ll always remember not to defy me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a frightening step back. My eyes roamed over he body until it landed on the necklace around her artfully crafted neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s had it on from the first day I saw her in my Pack. And every other time I&#39;ve seen her, she always had it on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pendant-whatever it was-was always hidden in her dress. But from the cord, I could tell it was nothing fancy. Yet she always had it on her like it was very important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was. And no punishment would be more befitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Closing the distance between us with a swift move,l yanked it off her neck. Her eyes widened like saucers, her lips forming an exaggerated &#39;O&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never seen anyone look more pale before. Right there, she looked like she was about to die.</p>
