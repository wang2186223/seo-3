                <p>JACE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were the chances of bumping into someone you didn&#39;t wish to see?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For Jace, it was ninety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was at his father&#39;s complex, reviewing sales when a particular client walked in with a young, fine woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A client he hadn&#39;t spoken to in days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the awkward incident at Jaris&#39; party,Jace had been doing all he could to avoid meeting with Kael.It was stressful that everyday at Darkspire, he had to pray not to run into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was sitting at the sales desk, the big book open in front of him. But his mind totally left the book and was occupied with Kael making his way into the shop with the beautiful lady&#39;s hand around his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They both tensed when they locked eyes on each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sales girls approached them immediately,offering them a warm welcome. But the woman beside Kael did the talking as he was busy staring at Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took all of Jace&#39;s willpower to end the awkward stare and rise to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael. I&#39;d love to say we&#39;re glad to have you here but,this is the women&#39;s section.&#34; He tried to sound as grumpy as he always did, only it wasn&#39;t too effective at the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have eyes, Jace. I&#39;m here for her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman stopped talking with the sales girls to look at Jace. &#34;Hi! Do you own the place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could say that.&#34; &#34;Okay, cool. We&#39;re here to change my wardrobe, and I heard this is one of the best places for that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went with the sales girls to make some selections with Kael accompanying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand remained around his. And somehow,Jace couldn&#39;t get his eyes off it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was none of his business. She was beautiful, and any man would be lucky to have her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, an asshole like Kael was capable of love.He was lucky to have someone like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He returned to his seat, going through the reports. A minute later, he was still stuck on one page. Of course, why wouldn&#39;t he when he couldn&#39;t stop staring at the couple in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His throat suddenly felt dry. He requested water from one of the girls, and the clumsy girl accidentally spilled some on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my! I&#39;m so sorry!&#34; &#34;What is wrong with you, Camille!?&#34; Jace roared at her, thumping his fist against the table. &#34;How many times will you keep making these stupid mistakes!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady startled, her hands shaking slightly.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. It won&#39;t happen again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly grabbed a napkin to dab the water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at the couple again, Jace found Kael staring at him. Somehow, that infuriated him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you keep your eyes on the clothes?&#34; He rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael cocked a brow. The other girls in the shop looked at him with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when he realized. He was overreacting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. He was never one to get easily angry. What was wrong with him today?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Concluding he needed some air, he angrily left the shop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just outside, Camille was wringing the napkin she had used on the water inside. She looked very sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace realized he was wrong for what he did. Camille was one of his best staff. He shouldn&#39;t have yelled at her like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille.&#34; He placed a hand on her shoulder, making her look at him. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean what I said,okay?I just got mad and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused when her eyes widened like she had seen something shocking. She was staring past his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sir!&#34; She screamed just before she flipped them around, trying to bring them both to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gunshots rang through the air. Repeatedly. Then everything went blank.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Prepare hin for triage!&#34; I shouted at the nurses as we wheeled him on the stretcher.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Clear the space! Make way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands were covered with Jace&#39;s blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t the first time I was dealing with blood.But it was the first time it was someone closest to me. My bestfriend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was dying. The lady that had been shot alongside him was already dead on arrival. She was unlucky as the silver bullets had penetrated deep into her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace got some in his chest, but his heart must be mildly wounded as he was still alive. But he was bleeding to death. We were losing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere came in to assist me and the nurses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve administered some fluids but his vitals aren&#39;t stabilizing,&#34; I said, my heart racing as I prepped the equipment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere accessed him. &#34;The bullets must have penetrated his heart. We need to perform surgery to have them removed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was right. Without the surgery to remove the bullets, my powers won&#39;t work on him. I couldn&#39;t siphon physical things. So, there was no way he&#39;d heal if I tried to siphon the pain away while the bullets were still physically stuck in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands shook as we rushed him to the surgical ward.Kael was waiting outside and came to us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;s he? Just tell me the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was covered in blood. He had rushed into the hospital carrying Jace on his back.Considering how heavy Jace was, I knew it must have required a lot of strength.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll be fine,&#34; I threw at him without a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the surgical ward, doctor Guinevere prepared to perform the surgery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll do it.&#34; I doned the normal gloves. &#34;I can do it.&#34; This was no time to hide my powers. It was Jace. It didn&#39;t matter if I got caught or not. I wasn&#39;t losing him.</p>
