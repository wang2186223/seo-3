                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was the most important day in our world. And I wasn&#39;t going to miss out on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked into the Silver Citadel and found the Alphas, thechairman and other representatives gathered as expected. Everything was getting set, and they were all very shocked to see me. That, also expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris. What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; One of the representatives asked. Although, I could see the hope in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it look like, Adan? I am here to participate.&#34; I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was the registration for the Alphas seeking to contend for the King&#39;s Throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you talking about? I thought you were not interested?&#34; One of the Alphas asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their fear was so obvious. They already knew they didn&#39;t stand a chance against someone like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, initially, I had no interest in participating. But not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pinned Zarek with a stare as I replied to the other Alpha. &#34;I changed my mind. I just realized having this power would be awNesome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d be dead before I&#39;d sit back and watch Zarek win the throne. I wanted it all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could tell he was displeased, despite how much he tried to hide it. Well, he should be. He was nothing now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, we are glad to have you here,&#34; One of the representatives said with a bright smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We commenced the process. Our bloods were taken and we were made to swear an oath. This was to prevent us from causing a fight and shedding blood during and after the process. We are all expected to embrace our wins or losses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, gentlemen. And welcome to this great phase,&#34; the chairman declared. There were to be three trials in total. A date for the first trial was announced, which was two weeks from now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few more announcements and cautions, we were done and free to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, Zarek walked up to me as I headed for my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you doing this because your girl threw herself at me?&#34; It didn&#39;t miss the pain in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made a mental note to give him the satisfaction of losing my own temper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m actually here to make sure you don&#39;t win. But I guess you have multiple options. You can pick any of your choice,&#34; I answered without looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, Jaris! You already said you weren&#39;t interested! Why don&#39;t you just step back and let this go?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in front of my car where Kael already held the front door open. I turned to Zarek. &#34;Why are you so afraid? It looks like you&#39;re so certain that you stand no chance against me.&#34; I nodded. &#34;It&#39;s good to know.Didn&#39;t think you were this smart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to enter into my car, but the asshole had the guts to hold my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop this, Jar-&#34; he didn&#39;t get to finish his sick statement as I punched him hard in the jaw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stumbled back, his hand flying to his face. One more move and I&#39;d have sent my claws into his heart without regret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glaring at him, I entered into my car and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept checking the time. I couldn&#39;t wait for Marta to get home and provide me with some answers. For her shake, I hope she had something to say concerning Zarek coming into the garden shortly after she left,while I was still asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I knew the kids would be back from school, I headed to their room to check on Xylon. He told me he felt fine and even hungry. That was good news. His nanny brought him some food and I watched them eat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty, we have something for you.&#34; Xyla said, by the time they finished eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooh. You&#39;ve got me curious. What&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She and Xylon exchanged a glance and giggled before they ran into their closet. What were they-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped when I saw them coming out with a present! For the love of Selene!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you get me a gift!?&#34; I asked, completely astonished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They nodded with their cheeks turning crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,dearests.How very cute of you. You shouldn&#39;t have bothered!&#34; I tookit from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We just wanted to congratulate you for getting mated to daddy.&#34; Xyla said while Xylon nodded with a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank, my spirits turning sour. I tried to hide it from the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is so... thoughtful. Thank you. So much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all sat on the bed as I unwrapped the package. It came as an even bigger shock when I realized it was a set of jewelries-necklace, earrings and a bracelet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get the money for this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids looked at me like I&#39;d asked a weird question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We get a lot of allowance, Aunty.&#34; Xyla rolled her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.What an attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon took his tab and scribbled down on it. &#34;There&#39;s a mall in our school. Xyla and I saw this and decided to get it for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm.I playfully pulled his chin. &#34;I am so touched. Thank you. So so much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like them?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you saying? I adore them! They&#39;re the best things I own right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hugged them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened, revealing the devil in a brown dress. I forced myself not to roll my eyes as I closed up the box in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on here?&#34; Marta asked, her eyes on my gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. The kids were just being sweet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at the wrap on the floor. &#34;Did you bring a gift to them or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the opposite. They were just congratulating me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed a dark glint in her eyes as she looked at Xylon and Xyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a good thing you&#39;re back, Marta. I&#39;ve been waiting for you.&#34; I stood up. &#34;We need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without arguing-fortunately-she followed me out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why did Alpha Zarek come into the garden shortly after you left?&#34; I crossed my arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed, giving me a ridiculous look. &#34;And how am I supposed to know that? Like you said, &#39;after I left.&#39;Don&#39;t you think you&#39;re asking the wrong person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know why, but I feel there&#39;s something off about that night. Now that I think of it, it&#39;s very strange that you&#39;d call me over to discuss the safety of your kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on. You&#39;re trying to say me calling you to discuss my kids&#39; well-being is trash?&#34; She huffed. &#34;Well, you don&#39;t have a child, obviously. Otherwise, you&#39;d have known how important it is to take such matters seriously.&#34; Her words ran a deep wound. They cut me so bad I thought I was bleeding for real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes turned deadlier as I stepped up to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For your sake, I do hope you&#39;re telling the truth, Marta. Because, believe me, it won&#39;t be funny if I get to know you lied to me and did something stupid that night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She met my stare with defiance, but I could see the tiny crack in her expression.</p>
