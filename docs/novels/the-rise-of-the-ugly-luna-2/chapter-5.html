                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had to be a joke. Or at the very least, not what l was thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father&#39;s eyes turned more serious as he moved toward me. &#34;I thought of offering Nora to him, but she&#39;s already with someone else, and the Alpha King might become furious if he thinks we&#39;re trying to offer him someone else&#39;s woman. This is the reason you&#39;re the only choice we have, Lyric. And...you have no idea how perfect it is that you have your face back. Initially, I had been worried we&#39;d have issues with the Alpha King accepting you, but now, I am confident he&#39;ll be thrilled.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on,&#34; I scoffed, placing a hand on my thigh.&#34;Please don&#39;t tell me you made me travel all the way from Draconis just to be told that I am about to be sacrificed to a demon.&#34; No wolf was stranger to the name &#39; Darkspire&#39;.Even me who knew little of Pack matters still knew how dangerous they were and nobody wanted to have anything to do with them; not in this life, not in another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris is not a demon,&#34; Father said with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But that is exactly what he is. Years ago, you said the same thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Jaris Dreadmoor was the most vicious man I&#39;d ever heard about. Tales of how he had conquered his enemies-and sometimes, his friends-were no news to the Pack. Being from a family that produced only the strongest Alphas, he was currently the Alpha King of Darkspire, a man everyone feared and didn&#39;t wish to end in his bad books. I didn&#39;t know what he looked like. I&#39;d never been privileged enough to meet someone like Jaris Dreadmoor. Not that I ever wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are rumors that he killed his own father and brother!&#34; | raised my hand in the air. &#34;How do you want me to be with someone like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Those are mere speculations, Lyric. Besides,you&#39;ll only be with him for a year.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t need a year to kill someone, dad. All it takes is a minute, tops. But for someone like Jaris,I&#39;m sure half a minute would do. Besides,why does it even have to be for a year?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what I heard, Darkspire didn&#39;t have a Luna yet since Jaris&#39; rise to ascension. But if he wanted to take up a Luna, wouldn&#39;t it be long term or something? Why was he only asking for a year?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, I don&#39;t know, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you don&#39;t care,&#34; I cut in, pain edging toward my heart. &#34;All you care about is giving him a Luna so you can get the problem off your back. You don&#39;t care about the problem you&#39;re putting on mine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a fraction of a second, wonder flashed across his face. The Lyric he knew would never argue with him.She&#39;d have humbly agreed to anything he wanted. Well, let&#39;s just say I got to know my worth when l realized how beautiful | was. This Lyric was tired of being people&#39;s puppets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father came close enough to take my hand. This time, he looked so troubled, I feared he might go on his knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, please.&#34; He gave my hand a little squeeze.&#34;This is the last I&#39;ll ask of you as your father. Just do this for me, for only a year. And I promise, you&#39;ll make me the happiest father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours later, I stood in my room-or what used to be my room-staring at my reflection in the mirror. I was wearing a long red dress with my hair falling over my shoulder.I was fully ready to meet Alpha Jaris, even though I&#39;d rather | don&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something didn&#39;t feel right. Him wanting a Luna for only a year....it was wrong. But father had nearly gone on his knees begging me earlier. I could disappoint him. Besides, before he got mated to his second wife, there were times he&#39;d been good to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| tried to resist the temptation as I stared at the drawer before me. But failing woefully, I still opened it and retrieved the scan. My heart fractured completely, old wounds reopening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the one picture in the world that had the power to kill me every single time I looked at it, yet it was like a drug to me. I was addicted and could barely go an hour without touching it. Feeling it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear dropped from my eye as I glided my finger across the images outlining the shapes of the unborn babies in the womb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five years, yet still the best thing that&#39;s happened to me.And the worse. But I&#39;d rather hold onto the fact that it was the best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt so bad staring at them, but | couldn&#39;t stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of someone trying to open my door broke into my thoughts. I jerked back to reality and quickly hid the picture. I&#39;d made sure to lock the door a while ago, not wanting anyone to see me with the photo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting the door, I found Nora, fuming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you get rid of your scar?&#34; Her voice blared with indignation. &#34;And what exactly is your plan? You want everyone to see the beautiful you, don&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, my earlier pain dissolving temporarily. &#34;Please, don&#39;t tell me you knocked on my door just to whine about how good I look.What,you really thought I&#39;d look that heinous forever?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glare turned even icier. &#34;Well, just so you know,this won&#39;t change a thing between you and Roderick.Soon, he&#39;ll be here, both of you would go to the temple and finish your breakup.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me instantly. Oh, no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; I blinked. &#34;You and Roderick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A triumphant smile played on her lips. &#34;Years ago,things didn&#39;t work between us. But now, he&#39;s ready to choose me.&#34; Well, if Roderick wasn&#39;t a bigger bastard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh, you disappoint me, Nora. Using my leftovers?&#34;I tsked. &#34;Considering you&#39;ve always thought yourself the pretty one, I expected better from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tense glare pulled her brows together. She opened her mouth to say something, but I caught her off.&#34;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;m done with Roderick and can&#39;t wait to fully end things with him.&#34; I slammed the door in her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, father and I arrived Darkspire in one of his luxury cars. The Pack, which was known to be the biggest and wealthiest, was just as beautiful as people said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was dazzled by the sight and couldn&#39;t believe for a moment that I&#39;d be Luna here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alighting our car, father and I were led into one of the buildings by some maids while his guards remained outside. The Grand Luna-Jaris&#39; mother-was in the large living room to welcome us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bennett! I am so glad you made it,&#34; the Luna said,her eyes holding little amusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, Luna.&#34; | dipped my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regarded me with surprise. &#34;Is this your daughter?&#34; She asked dad. &#34;Well, bless Seraphis,she&#39;s gorgeous!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help my smile. Luna Isolde, during her time,was a formidable Luna. She had ruled beside her late husband with an iron fist, destroying everyone who dared cross her path. I&#39;d always wished to meet her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, come sit while we wait for Alpha Jaris.He&#39;ll be joining us shortly,&#34; she showed us to the couch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her version of &#39;shortly&#39; turned out to be almost an hour later. Father and I were already exhausted and kept staring at the door, wondering how long it&#39;d take the Alpha to arrive. Wasn&#39;t he aware he&#39;d be having guests? His...new Luna? At a point, Isolde looked angry and left. When she returned, she reassured us he&#39;d soon be here. And indeed,he did come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air shifted in the room the second the door opened,revealing a man and two others behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Luna drew in a breath of relief as she rose to her feet. Father and I did same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was easy spotting who the Alpha was as the two other men flanked him. But the moment I had a clear view of his face, my world shattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Horror gripped my chest, squeezing it until | felt pain.This had to be some twisted joke. Because how in Selene&#39;s name was I staring at the face of the very man that had ruined me five years ago?</p>
