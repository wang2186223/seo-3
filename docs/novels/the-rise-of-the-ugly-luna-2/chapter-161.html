                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The window was tinted, so the people out there couldn&#39;t see what was happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I was about to open the door to rush out, he seemed to calm down. His hand dropped from his head as he slowly opened his eyes. More blood had stopped rolling out of his nose, only the old trail left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?!&#34; My voice was in high pitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me and seemed a little perplexed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-You&#39;re bleeding.&#34; I quickly reached for my bag and fished out my napkin. He tried to take it from me so he could do it himself but l avoided his hand and took care of the bleeding myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breathing seemed a little uneven, but we didn&#39;t say a word to each other until I was done cleaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened?&#34; My voice was quieter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34; He frowned, his eyes staring down at the steering in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something clicked in my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden told me something else last night. He said he left a little gift for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t even sure if the two were related. I just didn&#39;t want to hold any information back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris looked at me and said nothing. Without a word, he started thecar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;M-Maybe I should drive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.But I was still so worried and kept looking out for him the entire ride home. I was beyond relieved when we got to Darkspire successfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; he calmly called as he pulled out the car key. &#34;I didn&#39;t mean what | said this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused until he added, &#34;I actually like it when you call me by my name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at him in disbelief before a smile broke free. It was enough to make me feel a little better</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; I replied in a small voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We came out of the car together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think we should go to the pack clinic? If I could get some ingredients, I could-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Stop worrying, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath and followed him into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to watch my every step, Lyric. I&#39;m not one of your patients who&#39;s been diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. All I had was a little headache.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And bloody nose,&#34; I rolled my eyes as I added, chuckling as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did he even know I was actually watching his steps, scared he might trip or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He did look very strong though. It was just hard to get over what I&#39;d seen in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused when he noticed I was following him to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are you now, my nanny?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I doubled over in laughter. Here I was being concerned for someone who was making fun of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just feel like seeing you off,&#34; I shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think your brother has something to do with this?&#34; I asked in a small voice. &#34;Maybe.I&#39;ll find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything else for fear of saying something that would make his mood worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could finally see his door, but with each step we took, his room still seemed farther. I realized we were the ones walking slowly. Too slow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What were we doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, we got to the door and an odd flutter stirred within my chest. I was really worried about him and hoped he&#39;d be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you let me check on you in the morning?&#34; I spoke quietly, as if afraid to be heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took his time before he looked at me, one hand in his pocket. He looked utterly unruffled, nothing like the man that had scared me in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tongue glided across his lower lip before retreating it into his mouth, his eyes zipping around the floor,caught in reverie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, Lyric, if you actually want me to help me medically, there&#39;s something more important you could do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My pulse quickened, because I already knew what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you&#39;ve been shying away from this very topic.&#34; He braced his side against the wall, his eyes staring intently at my nervous face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were already on the floor, searching for something that wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-Ium...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you shy because it&#39;ll involve you touching me intimately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat, the one that followed becoming too heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know we agreed on &#39;no intimacy,&#39; but I really.don&#39;t mind this, Lyric. After all, you&#39;re a doctor. You should see me as your patient.&#34; Like it was that easy. It was him we were talking about!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I have to do to get you to agree, huh?&#34; He moved away from the wall. &#34;Name your price.Anything at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hold on. He was coming closer to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a while to remember what he&#39;d just said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-It&#39;s not about the money. I...I really want to help.&#34; My throat suddenly felt dry. Painfully dry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, when are we starting?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, that I didn&#39;t know. Would I really be comfortable touching him? I was already haunted considering the fact that I was always having these weird dreams of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took another step toward me, becoming too close. What was he doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His scent became too close. Intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breaths turned labored as I looked at him from aclose range. The shy part of me was tempted to lower my gaze, but the hungry part of me was eager to enjoy this moment. I didn&#39;t know when next I&#39;d have this opportunity, anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d lost track of our conversation, too lost in the surreal moment of ourselves in this close proximity and atmosphere for the first time. My eyes zeroed in on his lips, and man, that was tempting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I looked back into his eyes, I was stunned to know he was staring back at my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nervousness went to a whole new level, forcing me to take a step back, but his hand shot out, grabbing mine and bringing me to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small gasp escaped me, and before I could say a word, he crashed his lips on mine.</p>
