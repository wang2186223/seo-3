                <p>My mind whirled from his words. For some time,l was totally out of words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry, what did you just say?&#34; My face crumpled in bemusement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard me. I&#39;m sorry for everything that happened. But I&#39;m ready to be a better man. You know me, I&#39;m powerful now. can take good care of you. Everything will be better than it was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was more alarming how he spoke with so much confidence, like I was just supposed to run into his arms at his sweet words. Like I didn&#39;t know how devilish his heart was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back to him. &#34;If you think I, Lyric Harper, will ever get back to you, then you&#39;re more delusional than I gave you credit for. I am done with you and never coming back. Now, let&#39;s go to the temple and end this!&#34; By the grace of the night, I never thought I&#39;d be the one pestering Roderick to go to the temple. The asshole had been on my neck for months, asking me to come back and finish the bond. And now, he thinks he could say trash?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, then&#34; he shrugged casually. &#34;You&#39;ll just have to find a way to put up with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took up his keys and walked past me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran after him, getting in front of him. &#34;You&#39;re not doing this, Roderick. I&#39;m done with you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking and simply stared into my face.He gave me this long soft stare. &#34;You&#39;re fucking beautiful, Lyric,&#34; he furrowed his brows. &#34;How did |never see this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You were too busy seeing the ugly side of me,asshole!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could react, he touched my hair, twirling some of the strands around his finger. What was wrong with him? This guy was actually about to get mated to my sister! How much of an asshole could he be?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll see you soon.&#34; He continued on his way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran after him, calling and yelling, but he didn&#39;t stop for one second. And when we got to his car, his guards wouldn&#39;t let me get any closer. He got in and rode off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers through my hair, utterly frustrated. This had to be a joke!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Roderick wouldn&#39;t sever the last bond with me,then I couldn&#39;t get mated to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She walked into the room where her kids were fast asleep. Making sure the door was shut, she proceeded to the bed and tapped Xyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The little girl came awake with a slight grunt.&#34;Mummy? Is it time to get ready for school?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s not.&#34; Marta withdrew a stick of cigar and lit it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It got Xyla coughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just have a question for you.&#34; She took a drag from her stick. &#34;Why did you snitch on me to your dad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla&#39;s countenance dropped. She already knew where this was headed and was already scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I told you not to tell him? Were you so desperate to make mummy look bad before him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla shook her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took another drag from her cigar, releasing the smoke toward the little girl&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve always being the problematic one. Why can&#39;t you be like your brother, huh? Always minding his business he hardly talks? Why can&#39;t you have some sense!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, mummy. I was just worried about Xylon. The woman was able to treat him in...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, shut it!&#34; She half-yelled, startling the little girl.&#34;Do you have any idea the trouble you caused me?Do you seriously enjoy being destructive in my life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla dug her small finger into her palms. &#34;But Xylon and I are your children. Shouldn&#39;t you want the best for us? Hiding the nice woman&#39;s identity makes you look like a bad mom.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta scoffed, her eyes turning icier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went closer to her. &#34;How many times have I told you to watch that tongue of yours, you spoiledlittle brat? You really have no respect, do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at the burning end of her cigarette.&#34;Well, right now, I&#39;ll be reminding you of what happens when you disobey mummy. It&#39;sbeen long.Seems you&#39;ve forgotten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla panicked and crawled away, into the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No screaming, Xyla. Remember what happens when you scream.&#34; Marta taunted. The girl&#39;s eyes brimmed with tears as she awaited the burn from the cigarette.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told father everything that happened with Roderick,and as expected, he was pissed and tried reaching out to him, but his calls were ignored.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his study, he explained the dangers to me. &#34;The reason Darkspire had rejected your sister was because they knew she was entangled with Roderick already. If they find out the same about you, I&#39;m afraid they&#39;d want to reject you as well, and I&#39;d have to find a way to pay up the debt which would become a very big problem, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was also concerned about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But Roderick is powerful now, and he was interested in Nora. Didn&#39;t he ever think of helping with the debt?&#34; | asked when it occurred to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He promised to support with half of it once he ended things with you and got mated to Nora. But now, everything&#39;s just messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the end, father told me to keep up the act with Jaris while he goes to Roderick&#39;s Pack himself to get the issue sorted out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time, a car did come to pick me up.I was a little nervous as we drove off to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know why, but I had a feeling that things could get really rocky for me. There was just something about Jaris that screamed danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at Darkspire and I was led into the large living room. I was offered a drink and some snacks and asked to wait for Jaris who was busy with some important issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for more than thirty minutes, I got bored with just sitting and decided to explore the room. The room was quite large with a lot of artworks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up interest in one very large frame on the wall. It was Jaris, straining an arrow, ready to shoot.The picture was quite simple, but the sight of himwas beyond hot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was a beauty. My mind drifted to the first night I saw him-the goosebumps, the excitement,the thrill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Until tonight, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess!&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, his words still send shivers down my spine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did he have to leave by morning? What went wrong in what had seemed like a perfect moment?I wish I could get answers from him, but the old Lyric was a part of me l&#39;d been trying so hard to bury.I never wanted to awaken it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sad smile formed on my lips as I skimmed my fingers along the portrait. A one-night experience that was still unforgettable even after so many years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my hand and turned around to see so meone on the stairs, gawking at me like I was committing a grave offense. My heart sank when l recognized her. The kids&#39; mother. Jaris&#39;s possible lover.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over here, you don&#39;t just touch things you&#39;re not supposed to.&#34; She continued her descent down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A couple of seconds and my head was back to normal. I glanced at the frame, then at her. &#34;Sorry,but it&#39;s just a portrait. I don&#39;t think it was dipped in gold or there&#39;s a warning sign saying &#39;do not touch&#39;.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Displeasure creased her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re a stranger here,&#34; her voice was colder.&#34;There are rules you should stick to. You should try to listen to me when I&#39;m talking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit down my retort as I lowered my gaze. If I did go through with the Alpha&#39;s contract, Ms. hot-head and I would clearly be seeing each other more often.I didn&#39;t want to be on the wrong side with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her hot glare on me. She started toward the door but suddenly paused, turning to me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Once again, you were wrong to have gone into my kids&#39; room without my consent. That must not happen again, whoever-you-are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, what was her problem? &#34;I know. You made that crystal clear when you asked me to leave without thanking me for helping your son. Besides, I think you know who I am already, otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t be so bitter towards me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just say I&#39;m bitter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious? You keep trying to start up an issue with me when it&#39;s unnecessary.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And honestly, I wasn&#39;t in for this. I&#39;d rather not have someone like her to deal with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes darkened as she started toward me. I looked at her in confusion, wondering what silly idea she had in mind.</p>
