                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept counting the hours until morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as it was the break of dawn, I planned on leaving immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when morning came, I was surprised by a breakfast buffet, a new dress, and a nurse checking on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to believe that Jaris had thought of these himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freshened up, changed into the fresh dress-a cute black knee-length gown, by the way-and ate to my fill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse remnoved the bigger bandage around my head, having it replaced with a small patch. She also told me I was fine and could move about. Not like I had any intention of staying over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I finished and went to the other room, I found Jaris already dressed, talking with Kael and Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. He had the general Alphas&#39; meeting to attend. Even my father was attending.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I waited for him to finish with his men before I greeted him and told him I was leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re leaving together,&#34; he cocked his head at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion must have had to do something else because they didn&#39;t follow us out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked behind Jaris as we reached the elevator and waited for it to open up. When it did open, there were two occupants inside, people I recognized-Alpha Zarek and his Luna, Chloe. I had met them at the funeral last night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed their eyes dim the moment they saw Jaris. Well, I wasn&#39;t surprised Jaris had a lot of enemies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a slight hesitation, he stepped into the elevator, and I did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Zarek and his Luna were behind us, the air in the small space tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know you had a woman now,&#34; Zarek said.&#34;Congratulations.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris chuckled. &#34;Quite funny. I didn&#39;t know you considered it an achievement. It explains why you were quite sad when a certain woman left you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. What the hell was going on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, nothingelse was said until the elevator reached the ground floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, right?&#34; Zarek called as we all stepped out of the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t say anything, but he smiled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was nice meeting you,&#34; he uttered the words with a certain menace. Then, he smirked at Jaris and left with his Luna, whose face seemed to be covered in shame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris didn&#39;t utter a word, but I could tell he was pissed. We left the reception and headed for his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>······</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I dropped Lyric off at the suite her father had reserved, I proceeded to The Silver Citadel for the Alphas&#39; meeting. I&#39;d rather be anywhere but here, but it was mandatory as important matters had to be discussed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half an hour later, the meeting fully commenced</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every single Alpha was present. The seating arrangement was far from normal. It was arranged in a ring-like position with the Alphas sitting according to their ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Pack Overseers-which were the Lycan Chairman and Representatives-sat in the first circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second row was occupied by the Sovereign Alphas-which was my Pack and nine others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas of the major Packs followed, and then the minor Packs were last. Those ones hardly had a say in public matters.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Lycan Chairman gave the opening speech, talking about the late King and how good of a leader he had been. He hinted at the fact that investigations into his death were still ongoing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After that, he brought up some pressing issues like hanging taxes and...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, we arrived at the main reason for the gathering-the throne of the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As we all know, it cannot be vacant for long. Someone would have to fill that space. Someone worthy, of course.Since King Thaddeus&#39; death was untimely, he was unable to recommend anyone. So now, we&#39;d have to do it the usual way. But as we all know, only the Sovereign Alphas can partake in the challenge for the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drank some water while the Chairman spoke about the rules.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, from the Sovereign Alphas, which of you would like to partake in the challenge?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All nine of them lifted their hands. I suppressed the urge to scoff.Seriously?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. The Chairman was yet to move on to the next phase. I noticed all eyes were shifting to me.Then,I suddenly realized what the problem was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; The Chairman called. &#34;Are you not...participating?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I was, my hand would be up. I&#39;ve been attentive, Luca.&#34; My reply stunned everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you trying to say... you are not interested in taking the throne?&#34; One of the representatives asked. He was among those who hadvisited my Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged, nonchalant. &#34;I honestly have no interest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I loved power, but I was already getting enough of that, being the Alpha of Darkspire. Almost everyone would bow to my will. I didn&#39;t feel like getting my hands dirty for the extra position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow.&#34; Zarek, who was sitting across from me, clapped. &#34;I never knew you were so generous, Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bet he&#39;d be grateful. With me out of the picture, Zarek was the one with a higher chance of winning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,he could kiss my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meeting finally came to an end, I went over to the Citadel&#39;s bar to pour myself a glass of Bourbon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m curious, Jaris. Why aren&#39;t you participating in the Alpha challenge?&#34; Zarek asked as he joined me at the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced composure into my bones. Could anyone get him away from me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me, is it because you do not have a Luna yet?&#34; He leaned against the counter, staring into my face with that smirk I&#39;d very much love to get rid of.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the requirements for participating in the Alpha challenge was to have a Luna. Funny how they thought I couldn&#39;t easily get a Luna if I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A date for the commencement of the challenge had been fixed, and it was to begin in a few weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the lady I saw you with at the suite? She was quite beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your own woman suddenly not enough, Zarek? It&#39;s a bit shameful to compliment my own woman in front of me.&#34; I swigged from my glass while he laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you think she&#39;d be as loose as Chloe was?&#34; His face grew more serious as he asked. &#34;If she&#39;s tempted,do you think she&#39;ll cheat on you without hesitation?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Chloe left you for me. Take a good look at &#39;me,&#39; Zarek. Do you think anyone can beat me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not the hottest guy on earth, Jaris. How about we give this a bet?&#34; His eyes beamed. &#34;If you promise not to interfere, I think I can get your woman to sleep with me in seven days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cocked my head to meet his gaze. &#34;Really,Z?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; He shrugged. &#34;Unless you are certain that she&#39;s loose and can easily be seduced.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not loose.&#34; My voice came out clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, you have nothing to be afraid of, Jaris. Give me seven days, and I&#39;ll show you how loose your woman can be. Believe me, she&#39;ll be begging to return to my arms.&#34;</p>
