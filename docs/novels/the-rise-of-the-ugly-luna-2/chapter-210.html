                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The argument lasted for sometime with people from the low ranks throwing words against the high ranks.When I&#39;d had enough, I signaled them to stop talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miguel,&#34; I called the high-ranking Alpha involved.&#34;You do realize that Jaxen&#39;s family worked hard for this company, don&#39;t you? If the roles were reversed and you had to give it up-something you&#39;ve worked so hard for-would you be happy about it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. &#34;My King, I perfectly understand your point. And truly, a part of me feels bad that I&#39;m taking this from him. But it&#39;s my inheritance. Mg father was a clueless man who didn&#39;t know how to work hard for something, and instead,gave it away. Now I want it back. I even told Jaxen he has the right to demand for something higher if he doesn&#39;t like what I&#39;m offering. I think I&#39;m being considerate enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, fuck you and you considerations, Miguel,&#34; Jaxen spat. &#34;You&#39;re not getting a thing that belongs to me!Over my dead body!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why do we even have this ranks dividing us?&#34; A low-ranking Alpha said. &#34;I mean, were all leaders here.Why can&#39;t we all be equal?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I bet you wouldn&#39;t say this if you&#39;re on the high side,&#34;.someone snickered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A full-blown argument ensued from this, one that caused me a migraine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough!&#34; I hit my hand on the table, shutting them up. &#34;Alpha Jaxen, Alpha Miguel, I&#39;ve heard your complaints. Now I&#39;ll need some time to go over this and come up with the best solution. So, I&#39;ll implore you, go home and wait for me. No more bloodshed,otherwise, the consequences will be immediate.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting finally came to an end, but the burden was not lifted off my shoulder. Coming up with a solution would be difficult. If I were to do the right thing, then it was only right for Miguel to reclaim the land. But in what world was that fair?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head was aching.I needed Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went for her room but couldn&#39;t find her in. Tried calling her line, only to discover it was left in the room.Where did she go without her phone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started making calls, trying to see if anyone knew where she was, but nobody was with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>These days, I tend to act irrationally whenLyric was involved, especially when there was even the slightest chance she might be in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Information reached me from the gate that they&#39;d seen her driving out. I didn&#39;t waste any time as l headed out, driving in my car to look for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and Kael joined in the search in a separate car,but apparently, we didn&#39;t even need to go far. We found her seated by the roadside, in a bus station. I alighted the car and ran to her, my heart hurting from the steep descent of deep relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was she doing out here?! Wearing something this light in this weather?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprang to my feet when I saw Jaris approaching.How did he find me so fast? I was really hoping l&#39;d spend some alone time here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; My voice came out fragile despite my effort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here, Lyric? Why didn&#39;t you take your phone with you, at least? Do you know how worried I was?&#34; He snapped as he looked around, as if looking for any sign of danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I shook my head, my eyes dropping to the floor. &#34;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be done with the meeting so soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a long stare and seemed a little calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you out here alone? It&#39;s late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart ached from the recollection of the incident that led me here. Just thinking about it brought tears to my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde knocking on my door, her hateful eyes and venomous words, &#34;It was a huge mistake letting you get mated to my son. I want you out, Lyric. Take your cursed child and leave!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Jaris came closer,holding my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to force a smile. &#34;Of course. I just wanted to get some air. I was... honestly bored of being there alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve sent me a message, then. All you had to say was &#39;hey, Jaris, I&#39;m kinda lonely she feel like I&#39;m dying without you.&#34; Sure, I&#39;d have come running.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I burst out laughing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He helped me sit back on the bench, then sat beside me. We spent some time together, talking and laughing about the commonest things. When he noticed I was cold, he dashed to his car where he got a sweater and handed it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweater smelt like him-just as I liked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held it tight around me, unable to contain my smile each time I sniffed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something in me told me to enjoy every bit of this moment. This happy moment with the man I love.Because somehow, people like me were never lucky in love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Lyric and I returned to the Pack House later at night, I checked on the kids and was relieved to know they were still awake-even if they should be deep asleep by now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dismissed their nanny so | could have some alone time with them and started the conversation about Lyric. &#34;Have you forgotten so soon that she used to be your friend? Your favorite aunt? What changed?She&#39;s never hurt either of you, has she? You don&#39;t get to hate someone only because your mummy said they&#39;re bad. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were quiet during the entire conversation but looked really guilty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to bed, hoping for a change. But unfortunately I woke up to very disturbing news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an attack just last night, and one of the Alphas were dead.Alpha Miguel.</p>
