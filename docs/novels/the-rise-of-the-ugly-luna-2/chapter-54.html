                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By some miracle, Jace and Kael managed to have a conversation without throwing words at each other.Although, the hostility was still very clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I excused myself when they were deep into the conversation so I could call Alpha Zarek, but he didn&#39;t take my calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t have my contact, right? So, he shouldn&#39;t know it was me calling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At night, the kids came over to my room to spend some time with me. Marta was working in TCH through the night. So, they stayed with me for a long time,played and eventually slept over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was noon of the following day when Jace called and asked me to meet him somewhere outside Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike Jace, he didn&#39;t sound cheerful but rather pissed.He ended the call as soon as he delivered the message, and I had to hurry over to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I parked my car next to his by the road side. He came out of his,same time I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace. Is there-&#34; My words were cut off when I saw how angry he looked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that I trusted him, I&#39;d have retreated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do, Lyric?&#34; He growled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he marched toward me,I finally found myself retreating until my back was against my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace! What is wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Answer me! What did you do!?&#34; His eyes were like daggers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. I didn&#39;t do anything!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glared down at me. His eyes softened a smidge and it dawned on me. He wasn&#39;t just angry. He was concerned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, talk to me. What is going on?&#34; My heart was thumping in against my chest now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for his phone in his back pocket, he tapped on the screen a few times before showing it to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the screen was a picture of me. Old me. With the scar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That picture wasn&#39;t taken. It looked like someone who was very skilled had drawn it. It looked exactly like the old me with my scar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;While I was overseas,&#34; Jace started. &#34;I got a connection to a hunt group called The Agents. Their existence is not often talked about because they keep a very low profile. But they hold a strong power over the werewolf world. They know when things are wrong and punish those responsible. Most times, they kill them. They&#39;re commonly known as the Executioners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to leave when I saw how demanding the job was. They&#39;re dangerous, Lyric. And rightnow,they&#39;re after you.&#34; He tapped the screen. &#34;The old you.They&#39;re out to kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth hung open in shock, fear eating me from the inside out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods,please. It couldn&#39;t be true.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have tried to ask around to know what you did,but I can&#39;t get anything. Like I said, they keep a low profile and I&#39;m even lucky I got to see this. So, I am asking you, Lyric.&#34; He stepped closer to her. &#34;What the fuck did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around to hold onto my car for support as my legs had become too weak to move. I was losing my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here I was, thinking it was over. Thinking I&#39;d escaped it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34; Jace snapped. &#34;These people only want you dead when you&#39;ve done something terrible. Something unforgivable. And believe me, they know how to hunt well. It won&#39;t take long before they find you. Your life is in danger!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| know!&#34; I whirled around to meet him. &#34;But what do you want me to do, Jace? I&#39;m scared!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,you can start by telling me what you did to get them on your tracks. Tell me the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, my fear heightening. &#34;I-I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric! Say something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt cold liquid against my cheeks. Tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a secret I&#39;d been harbouring for years. Jace was my best friend, but I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone what I&#39;d done. I was so afraid. &#34;They won&#39;t find me,&#34; I sniffled, dabbing my face.&#34;They&#39;re after the old me. They won&#39;t know it is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you kidding?&#34; He huffed, making me look stupid.&#34;They&#39;re already in Flodiria. Who knows how long it&#39;d take before they get you. You might have gotten rid of your scar, Lyric, but people like your family still know it&#39;s you. What happens when The Executioners run into someone that knows you and discover who you are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. Shit, of course he was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;S-So, what do I do, Jace?&#34; A tremor ran through my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace gave me an angry stare. &#34;You really won&#39;t tell me what you did,right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered my gaze. I wanted to confide in someone,but I was so scared of the truth growing wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine.You have to run.&#34; Jace said with finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the only option, Lyric. You have to go into hiding.They obviously know you&#39;re a wolf. So, they&#39;re looking at all the wolf packs. It&#39;d be better if you go far away to a human country where they can&#39;t find you. You need to leave, Lyric. Right now.&#34; &#34;No.&#34; I shook my head, my heart clenching painfully &#34;I cannot leave, Jace. Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when I stillhad a lot to do. Xylon was still very sick. Leaving now would be like abandoning him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace held my shoulders, shaking me. &#34;This is the only way, Lyric! Or would you rather stay back and get yourself killed? Would that be better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I didn&#39;t want to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll help you, Lyric.&#34; Jace&#39;s voice softened. &#34;I know of a nice place you could hide. I&#39;ll take you there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears streaked my cheeks as I thought of how ruined my life was about to become. I was about to lose everything.</p>
