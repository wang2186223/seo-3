                <p>I headed home feeling very happy. Feeling accomplished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I headed to my room and paused when I found someone standing outside my door. The passage was dimly lit. So, I had to go closerto get a proper view of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace?&#34; | stopped in my tracks, squinting my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed off from the wall where he leaned, giving me that annoying smirk of his. &#34;Yes, my hopeless child!It is l!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed as I ran into his arms. But our hug was brief.I needed answers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s late. What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; And more importantly,how does he plan on getting home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, it&#39;s late. So, mind telling me why you&#39;re just coming home?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, shut up, dad.&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;I have a job now.Back to my question. What&#39;re you doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,&#34; he shrugged. &#34;You staring at your newest neighbor.Open the door, Ly.&#34; Wait,what? &#34;I don&#39;t understand.&#34; | scoffed. &#34;Please,stop with your-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not joking. I got Kael to help me. Although,&#34; he furrowed his brows. &#34;I still don&#39;t know what he had to say to Jaris to let me move in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on, Jace. Why would you move in?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why else? To watch over your careless ass. You&#39;ll be here for a year. Your life is in danger at the moment.So,I need to be here to protect you when the worst happens.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart melted from the revelation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Jace,&#34; I made a pout. &#34;You really shouldn&#39;t have bothered. I&#39;ll be fine, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the exact thing people say before they get into trouble. Come on, the door.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand on the back of my neck,he pushed me toward the door. I chuckled and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you and Kael are cool now?&#34; I asked as I worked the keyhole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The moon forbid it. I was almost forced to go on my knees to beg that asshole to listen to me. I wonder how people deal with him. His type are the ones we need less in the world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed as I walked into the dark room with Jace following. I turned on the lights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How was your first day at TCH?&#34; My smile dropped as soon as he asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hesitated, dropping my bag on the bed before going to the dresser to take off my wristwatch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boring. I was asked to heal a man but couldn&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I refused to tell him the rest, that I snuck out and later healed him. I didn&#39;t think Jace would appreciate that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped me on the shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s for the best, Lyric.People have been surviving before you. Let&#39;s just leave it at that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flashed him a wistful smile before looking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta was clearly happy with what happened.&#34;I rolled my eyes, recalling the annoying look she had in her face.&#34;If it wouldn&#39;t have been unprofessional, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d have laughed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta. Who&#39;s Marta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A rude, tiring lady. Jaris&#39; baby mama.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. The mother of his twins. She works at TCH?&#34;&#34;Unfortunately. She&#39;s actually the head doctor in my department.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ooh.&#34; He clicked his tongue. &#34;And considering the fact that you&#39;re Jaris&#39; mate, I bet she&#39;d really make life hell for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She has. Fortunately, her kids are nothing like her.They&#39;re the sweetest things I&#39;ve ever met. Their birthdays are actually coming up in three weeks.&#34; I smiled, remembering when they made mention of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace clapped behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought struck me. I turned quickly to Jace, my fingers trying to unhook my earrings. &#34;Do you know her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;Nah. Never mether. But I do know there&#39;s someone with two kids for Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. I think she knows you, though.&#34; I told him what happened at the bar the other day. He seemed surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s interesting.&#34; His brows were furrowed.actually never met her before. Unless I have but didn&#39;t know she was the one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed to think for some seconds. &#34;Well, it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;m here. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get to meet her in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta had extra work to do and had to stay back in the office,through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she was ready to leave and was shutting her windows, she noticed Lyric leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This surprised her. It was her first day here, and she was barely seen. She shouldn&#39;t have too much work that&#39;d require her to stay the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something didn&#39;t sit right with her. Her whole act in the surgical ward...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Compelled,she followed her instincts and reached for Mr. Owen&#39;s room. She didn&#39;t even know why she was there. Lyric had clearly not been able to handle Mr.Owens earlier.Yet, Marta was compelled to check on the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching his ward, she found the man asleep.Peacefully,so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She went closer, inspecting him, and that was when she noticed the stitches on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; She breathed. She ran her finger along the stitches, feeling how fresh they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like a joke. Surgery had been done by the man. But by who? He wasn&#39;t scheduled for surgery until the next day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a few minutes, she was seated in front of the hospital&#39;s footage system. Normally, sha wasn&#39;t supposed to have access to those. But Marta had been in TCH for way too long to have her way with the tech men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of them stood by while she went through the footage. It didn&#39;t come as a shock when she saw Lyric entering the man&#39;s ward that evening. She already suspected it. But confirming it caused her a little unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t see what went on in the surgical ward,but Lyric stayed long enough for the surgery to be done. And when she was done and came out,she looked satisfied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unease prickled at her neck. How on earth did Lyric perform such complicated surgery on her own? And why did she do it in secret? It didn&#39;t make any sense.</p>
