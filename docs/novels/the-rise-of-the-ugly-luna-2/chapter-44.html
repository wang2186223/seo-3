                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can you even say that?&#34; I scoffed with disbelief. &#34;I&#39;ve been treating your son. You&#39;ve seen how good I am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve seen you perform little tricks and don&#39;t even know the source of your knowledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Little tricks? I&#39;ve done things you or no one else has been able to do in years. You can&#39;t just make a mockery of that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned colder. &#34;I told you no! These are the standards of TCH. It&#39;s not like I put them in place. So,why don&#39;t you take that and leave?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands balled into fists. How could I be rejected so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was nothing like the woman that had called me to the garden and spoke &#39;peace&#39;. Now, she acted as if that night never happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping you&#39;d give me a try, at least.&#34; I pressed. &#34;It&#39;s unreasonable to just dismiss me without seeing my potential. And you of all people know my potential. You know what I can do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes and picked up another file. &#34;For acquaintance&#39;s sake, don&#39;t tell me l&#39;Il have to throw you out of here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the door swung open, revealing an anxious nurse. &#34;Ma&#39;am, we have an emergency!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Marta and the nurse out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the only son of a beta. He was involved in an accident where a vital organ was affected. He doesn&#39;t have a wolf yet, so we&#39;re afraid we might lose him,&#34; the nurse briefed Marta as they hurried to the emergency ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went there with them, and my heart shattered at the sight before me. His throat was torn open, making him struggle for air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He also had big open wounds on his stomach and other parts of his body. The boy was wailing and writhing on the bed, and I didn&#39;t want to imagine how painful it must be for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta rushed in and joined the others that had been holding him down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get me a saline IV and prepare for immediate intubation!&#34; She demanded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That familiar feeling hit me. Instantly, I knew the quickest solution to his problem.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into the ward to meet Marta. &#34;Create a hole by the side of his neck and put a tube to secure it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at me while keeping her hands busy. &#34;What&#39;re you saying!? That&#39;s a-dangerous spot. He&#39;ll die immediately!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Trust me. Just do it! Or... Or at least, let me touch him.&#34; I felt if I could do it myself, it&#39;d go a long way in making him better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta ignored me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just do it! He&#39;s dying!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Shut up and get out, Lyric! I know what I&#39;m doing!&#34; She snarled at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger surged through my veins in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m afraid I have to ask you to leave, ma&#39;am. This is restricted to only staff,&#34;a nurse walked up to me and said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared hard at Marta who was no longer staring at me, then stormed out of the ward. But I remained there by the door, watching, my blood seething.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was she so stubborn? That was the only thing that would help the boy. I could see it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They all worked hard, giving him the IV and all. But it wasn&#39;t helping. And a few minutes later, the boy stopped writhing. He stopped crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bomb went off in my bed, shattering the remnants of my heart, and I couldn&#39;t stop the tears that rolled down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta tried using an AED to revive him, but it was as useless as her earlier attempts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were filled with sorrow as they covered him up with a linen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time of death. Eleven a.m,&#34; Marta announced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was another doctor coming beside me. I didn&#39;t even spare her a glance as I stormed into the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to make that hole. You could&#39;ve saved him!&#34; I yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please shut up. Creating that good would&#39;ve been deadlier. Stop trying to act like the savior all the time.&#34; She snapped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,damn it.I wanted to hit her in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re just selfish! And egoistic! Admit it, Marta! You didn&#39;t want anyone else seeing what I can do. You put your selfish interest above that little boy&#39;s life when you could&#39;ve healed him!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you lost your mind? I am the head of this department. That has only happened because I&#39;m quite good with my job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well,obviously, you&#39;re not that experienced. Tell me, how many lives have you lost in the past month?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked past me, like she was staring at someone, and I could see her fighting her fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not perfect! It doesn&#39;t hurt to get a little help sometimes,&#34; I added angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the footsteps of someone entering the room and spun around to see an elderly woman before us,wearing a lab coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accessed me. &#34;Who are you?&#34; She shifted her gaze to Marta, then the boy at the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re you so certain that the tube in his hole would ve saved him?&#34; She asked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the problem. i couldn&#39;t explain how I knew. &#34;l just know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; She gave me a head to toe stare&#34;&#34;And what&#39;re you doing here exactly?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I handed my file to her. &#34;I came to apply to be a doctor here. But Marta was just kicking me out before the incident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman looked at Marta with surprise in her eyes while holding my file. &#34;You were dismissing an applicant without bringing her to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched Marta&#39;s face pale. &#34;She....she doesn&#39;t have any experience. I thought it&#39;d be a waste of time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we&#39;ve already established the fact that every applicant must go through me, whether accepted or rejected. Your only job is to do the first assessment, Ms Monroe. You have no right to just dismiss people without my knowledge.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta dropped her gaze to the floor, shame coloring her cheeks. I felt a little calm as Marta got scolded.Hm.Whoever this woman was, she must have some real power in the place. She must be Marta&#39;s superior.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman lowered her angry eyes to my file and went through it. It took some seconds, then she handed it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll get a call in a couple of days. I&#39;ll see what we can do with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dipped my head. &#34;Thank you so much, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at Marta once more before walking away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good thing there are people with brains in this place,&#34; I mumbled to the hearing of Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I caught herglare and glared back at her before leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The death of the little boy still stung. It could&#39;ve been avoided.Marta was a real bitch</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove at an infuriating speed until I got to Darkspire. I was still in the car when I checked my email and discovered the garden manager had sent the footage. I was a little nervous as I clicked play, and the video came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The camera was only at the entrance to the garden. So I couldn&#39;t see what happened in there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it showed the moment Marta entered, followed by me, minutes later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, Marta left. And to my astonishment, Alpha Zarek went in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the heck?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replayed the video to make sure my eyes weren&#39;t deceiving me. Marta must have left when I was already asleep on the table. So, what was Alpha Zarek doing there!?</p>
