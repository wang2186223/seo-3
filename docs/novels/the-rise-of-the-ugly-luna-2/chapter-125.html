                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I might need help for real this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because why the hell was I motivated by the face of just one person when I was up there?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The task had been extremely difficult. It was enough to make even the strongest Alpha give up. Zarek was quite strong to have held on to the end, like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>People kept praising me for how effortless I made it seem. I didn&#39;t show any sign of weakness during my time there. But they didn&#39;t know what went on in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was pulling the heaviest weight I&#39;d ever had to deal with in my life, I was tempted to give up. But a constant face kept playing in my mind. I kept picturing her large green eyes smiling at me,urging me to stay strong. When the weight seemed too much, I imagined how disappointed those very pretty eyes would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to disappoint her, and as funny as it sounded, that was the one thing that kept me going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And when I finished and approached my seat on the stage, the happiness in her eyes did crazy things to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly made the ache I felt in my limbs feel useless. It made me feel like everything was worth it and if I had to, l&#39;d do it all over again just to watch that very happiness on repeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was beautiful. Too gorgeous. Being genuinely happy for me seemed like a rare sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I needed help. Lyric Harper was starting to do things I didn&#39;t understand to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the event came to an end, I had to go meet up with the Elders as they&#39;d mentioned having something important to tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went with Lyric who was still giddy with excitement,and it was all I could do not to hold her hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. What if she freaked out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the door of the meeting room, one of the Elders was already waiting outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations once more, Alpha Jaris. That was a spectacular move,&#34; he beamed, extending his hand for a handshake which I took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned to Lyric. &#34;Uh...Luna Lyric, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to wait out here for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him with surprise. &#34;Why can&#39;t she go in with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Alpha Jaris, but what we have to say in there is quite confidential.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine,&#34; Lyric said with a smile that was genuine enough to tell me she wasn&#39;t offended in any way.&#34;I&#39;ll just wait by the car,&#34; she directed at me. I followed the Elder in as she walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were voices coming from the room, and I stopped in the middle when I came face to face with Zarek. He was clearly done talking with the Elders and was making his way out. But I stood in the said way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris.&#34; His lips lifted in a smirk. &#34;Will you accept my congratulations?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes held nothing of the fake mirth he had in his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s a good thing you asked, and no.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a casual shrug. Gods, I wanted to punch him. If there weren&#39;t so many eyes on us right now...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He might&#39;ve done the right thing by confessing to what he did, but he was an asshole for going along with it in the first place. So, what if he didn&#39;t get to know Lyric and see her to be a nice person? He wouldn&#39;t have confessed, and I&#39;d have spent my whole life degrading Lyric for something she didn&#39;t do. &#34;It&#39;s just the two of us now, huh?&#34; He chuckled.&#34;Why don&#39;t you just do us both a favour and step down for me, Jaris? You know what the last trial will be about.It&#39;ll be bloody.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I think we already know whose blood will be on the floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed, but I could see he was getting pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; he stepped closer to me. &#34;I won&#39;t go soft on you in any way. From birth, I&#39;ve been meant to sit on this throne. I grew up visiting the Capital often and looking forward to the day I&#39;ll be King.I won&#39;t let you take it from me, Jaris. I deserve it more than you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to laugh in his face. The asshole was delusional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tsk. Tsk. It looks like you&#39;re worried,&#34; I tilted my head to the side. &#34;You&#39;re trying so hard to make me back down because you know you&#39;ll be nothing against me on the final trial. And you dare tell me you deserve the throne more than I do? With this cowardice of yours?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, gentlemen!&#34; One of the Elders called from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They couldn&#39;t hear what we were saying, but they must be able to tell it couldn&#39;t be something good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek&#39;s eyes burned like coals, my words clearly hitting him in the wrong spot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smirked as I walked past him, making sure to hit his shoulder with mine in the process.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, it was just me and the Elders in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They congratulated me for the nth time on my amazing performance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve always known you were the right man for this job, Alpha Jaris! You didn&#39;t even show any sign of pain,&#34; Luca said joyously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You amazed the people. That was beyond impressive!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept nodding at them until they finished with their congratulatory speeches.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; Elder Landon began. &#34;Judging from how well you&#39;ve handled the first two trials, we have no doubt you&#39;ll ace the third as well. But before then,&#34; he gave an intentional pause. &#34;There is one important law you must know about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I listened attentively.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, it&#39;s the first time a potential Alpha King is uh...having kids out of wedlock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feeling adjusted deep within me. I didn&#39;t know what it was, but it suddenly became hard to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This conversation... My smart brain was already trying to decipher where it was headed, and I didn&#39;t like it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;As a result, we&#39;ve never had to make this law public,&#34; another Elder continued. &#34;But since in your case you have two kids with an un-mated woman,it is important for you to know that these kids will not be fully/acknowledged as royal kids.&#34; &#34;In essence,&#34; Luca took over. &#34;Your son will not be eligible for the throne when you&#39;re old and retired.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something stopped working in my chest. It was my heart. It wasn&#39;t beating right anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What in Hades were they talking about?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless,&#34; Landon was back talking. &#34;You get married to the mother of the kids. That is Marta Monroe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;ll have to be the Grand Luna of the Capital,ruling beside you.&#34;</p>
