                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted but no words formed. Jaris was asking me to stay. He might not be straightforward about it,but he wanted me to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I still didn&#39;t say a word, Xyla started another conversation. And fortunately, the conversation drifted from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,I did stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins and I spent some time watching a movie in the home cinema. Yup. Jaris had a freaking cinema built into his mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The twins slept off before the end of the second movie. I had to carry them one after the other to their rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done laying them both in beds and tucking them in, I turned to the door and startled when I found Jaris leaning against the doorframe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez! That gave me quite a stare. &#34;Good job.&#34; He tipped his head toward the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at them, not helping the smile that spread on my lips. Well, wwhat could I say? | enjoyed taking care of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How has Xylon been of recent?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s great. He hasn&#39;t had any of his epistles of recent.In no time,he should be completely fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on the kids on the bed.&#34;Thank you,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s nothing. We had an agreement, remember?was supposed to take care of him and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For bringing them over,&#34; he clarified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart fluttered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Jaris! You need to stop doing this! Stop playing with my emotions! You can&#39;t be sweet when you want to be, then go on to hurt me after and make me conflicted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked rapidly and smiled. &#34;It&#39;s my pleasure.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped away fromn the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are some clothes in the closet of your room.They belong to Marta, but you can pick something from there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, listening to my heart race as he walked out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In my very large and well-furnitured room,I stood in front of the dresser, helplessly staring at the pills in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, as stupid as it looked, I did come with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t know, a part of me had expected this would happen and I would somehow need to sleep with the kids. I didn&#39;t want to be stranded without the pills if that happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was getting addicted to these dreams, it was starting to bother me. But there was only little I could do when Jaris was so hot and the only time I got to be with him was in my head. In these dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With slightly shaky fingers, I popped one into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****	＊＊＊本十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the footage from my phone. When she took that pill-I couldn&#39;t explain what I felt. I had my suspicions that those pills would be with her and she might want to take it. That&#39;s the reason I installed a camera when she was in the cinema with the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the same thing I did with her room back in Darkspire. It was how l&#39;d gotten to know she didn&#39;t take the pills four nights ago and was hoping to see if it was all a dream or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to install the camera to know when she took the pills or did not. Because the last thing I wanted was jumping into Lyric&#39;s room in the middle of the night while she was awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cameras were so tiny, she couldn&#39;t see them.And the only time I looked at them was at night to know if she&#39;d taken the pills or not. As much as I&#39;d love to look at her at other times, I wanted to give her some privacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The joy I felt when she took the pill could not be overemphasized.I needed the distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric Harper might not know it, but she had been making me happy in a lot of ways of recent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kissed her in bed, enjoying how happy she was to have me here. She moaned into my lips,running her hands through my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was always so responsive to this. It made me wonder if she&#39;d ever do this without the pill. Did she like me in reality? Or does everything end in the dream?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a feeling she&#39;d never forgive me if she ever gets to know about this, though. I just didn&#39;t know how bad it was going to get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I undressed her in no time, got her on her hands and knees, and thrust into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had the best moan. The way she screamed when I went balls-deep inside her sent blood rushing faster in my cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Jaris...!&#34; Her fingers gripped the bedsheet tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes?&#34; I gritted, hardly able to recognize my own voice. &#34;Do you want me to stop, Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! No! Never!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her savagely, as hungry as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, I satisfied the both of us. In the end,we came multiple times.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up late in the morning. Not that it mattered.The office didn&#39;t open during the weekends. I felt better like I always did after my time with Lyric.I couldn&#39;t believe I&#39;d be managing to live without this for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I freshened upo in the bathroom and went downstairs to see what was happening. From the staircase, I could already hear the aroma and laughter coming from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slackened my steps as I got close, listening to my kids laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By tomorrow, that was likely to change. 2</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a man with my position, I&#39;d seen a lot of things.But Jace&#39;s accusation was bigger than I&#39;d ever expected. Not even in a million years would I have thought Marta would dare play the paternity fraud on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Plus, I had actually seen her pregnant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But maybe that was the problem. I only &#39;saw&#39;. I never touched her. And the whole time, she always had clothes on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if Jace was right? What if she had been careful enough to deceive all of us? The dark thoughts of what I&#39;d do to Marta had taken a temporary spot in my mind. But most importantly what would I do with the kids?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts came to a pause when I reached the entrance of the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was frying something in the pan. Xyla was sitting on the kitchen counters playing with a spatula, and Xylon was sitting on one of the stools facing the kitchen island, just before Xyla.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A foreign feeling tugged at my heart as I took in the sight. It was the first time I was having something like this-a woman cooking in my kitchen, surrounded by my kids who laughed at whatever she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right there, I looked like a man watching his family make breakfast. I knew this wasn&#39;t new to a lot of people who had lovey families, but I&#39;d never given a thought to it and had no idea it could actually &#39;look good.&#39;</p>
