                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell!?&#34; Josh flinched, stepping away from me immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had nearly lost my balance again due to his arms suddenly leaving me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart had sunk deep into the pit of my stomach as I prayed for the sight before me to be a dream.But it wasn&#39;t. Josh&#39;s friend was dead. Killed by Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, like dark pools, were on me. Then, slowly,they shifted to Josh, and he emitted a certain monstrous snarl. He tossed the heart to the floor and started approaching Josh and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Not me. Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I haven&#39;t done anything!&#34; Josh cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing what was happening, I ran to stand before Josh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing!? What do you have against him?&#34; I snapped at the man who looked insane right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Step out of the way, Lyric.&#34; His eyes were still on Josh behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why!? What did he do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he looked at me. And if I wasn&#39;t so angry myself, I&#39;d have crumpled to my knees in fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do I really have to spell it out? I need to explain why I want to kill a man who had his hands over you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dawned on me like a bell. My eyes widened like saucers at the realization.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, wait. He just killed Matt because he thought they were harassing me!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, don&#39;t tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to walk past me, but I moved, getting in his way.&#34;What is wrong with you? Alpha!?&#34; I added the last name maliciously. &#34;Did you just kill him because we were together!?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my dismay, he gripped my wrist with his bloodstained hand. The very one that had held Matt&#39;s heart. I wanted to puke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am trying so hard not to pour my frustration out on you. Now, get out of my way, Lyric Harper, before I do something I will regret.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced back at Josh, and he was scared to death.This only worked to infuriate me some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We are leaving. Now.&#34; I gritted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like hell we are.&#34; He tossed me aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before he could get to Josh, I was in front of him again. &#34;Please! He didn&#39;t do anything! I promise,he was just about leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell didn&#39;t you tell me you were connected to Alpha Jaris!?&#34; Josh yelled behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because I&#39;m not-l wanted to tell him, but Jaris was already blind-furious, and the last thing I wanted to do was grate on his nerves some more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not touching him. Otherwise, you can kiss goodbye to your son&#39;s treatment.&#34; My eyes were dead serious as I looked into his. And right there,I saw his rage grow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Josh took his chances. Carefully, and I mean, very carefully, he scurried out the door. To my greatest relief, Jaris let him. But his eyes didn&#39;t get any softer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Josh was safe, my anger was in full flow,especially as I stared at Matt on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dead. Because of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze turned icier as I walked past him, heading for the door. But a strong hand grabbed my wrist,twirling me around to face him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you just threaten me?&#34; His voice was as icy as the bite of a frigid breeze against exposed skin. &#34;I did! Because you were about to kill an innocent man!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand around my wrist turned painful, making me wince. My forehead crinkled as I looked at him, but there was still no mercy in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I do not take kindly to threats, Lyric Harper. Threats signify danger, and I am known to always eliminate dangers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go,&#34; my eyes turned glassy from how hard he held me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For your sake, I&#39;d advise you never interrupt me in this way,ever again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, take a look at the floor!&#34; I tipped my head toward Matt. &#34;He didn&#39;t deserve that. You don&#39;t just kill people because you&#39;re upset!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Upset?&#34; He looked at me like I was the unreasonable one. &#34;First, you come to a club wearing a revealing dress, get drunk, sing, and let some random guys grope you. You think I don&#39;t have a right</p>
                
                
                
                <p>to be upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34; I glanced down at my dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay, I was putting on some shorts which revealed my legs, but how was it his fucking business? I&#39;ve been dressing like this for years now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re not mated yet!&#34; I huffed. &#34;I don&#39;t understand how you can make judgments over my dress!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally released my hurting wrist, but I didn&#39;t try to walk away. We weren&#39;t done here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Besides, this is a club! Am I expected to wear a dinner dress? There are people wearing worse things than me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And the boys groping you? Or do you enjoy being touched inappropriately by them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips dropped open in shock. No, he didn&#39;t just insinuate that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were only dancing!&#34; My voice was louder now,filled with hurt. &#34;I don&#39;t get what your problem is. You can&#39;t control me this way!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to me,&#34; His voice dipped. &#34;I honestly do not give a fuck about how loose and wayward you are.I know your kind is bound to be this way, but in a few days, you&#39;ll be announced as mine. You&#39;ll have to represent Darkspire, and I can&#39;t have someone who doesn&#39;t know how to be comported be my Luna.You need to know your place, lady, and not bring shame to my name. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes glistened with tears which finally dropped to my cheeks. I balled my hands into fists, so hard my nails bit into my palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did he just call me loose? Wayward? Funny how he was the one who took my virginity. The only man I&#39;d actually ever slept with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at my face as I cried, yet there was no reason in his. Just bleak monstrosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was the man that had bedded me five years ago? Told me I was beautiful and made me feel loved when I thought the world wNas against me? How did I ever fall for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed out of the restroom, leaving me alone with my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran after him, catching up with him when he was close to his car. His beta already had his door opened for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t do this!&#34; I shouted, bringing him to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me, his eyes as intimidating as always.But I didn&#39;t cower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I thought I could pull through with this,but it&#39;s become obvious we can&#39;t work out. I&#39;m terminating the contract.&#34;</p>
