                <p>JACE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never did he think a man would make him behave this way. Have so much fear and doubt in himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,that was before he met Kael. The arrogant Beta who hardly gave a shit about anyone and was always out to get him with his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, here he was, wanting to explain himself because he couldn&#39;t imagine another day without him in his life.Another day knowing the man was mad at him and despised him so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was hardly one to show his emotions, but it was killing him inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you don&#39;t think it&#39;s one of those situations where I overlook time. You have sixty more seconds,&#34;Kael grumped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace stood in front of the shut door, his hands in his back pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael...&#34; His eyes remained on the floor.really want you to hear me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What else do you think you&#39;re in my room for?&#34; Before now, Jace had gone over the story with with Lyric. He knew what to say. Yet, somehow, the words weren&#39;t forthcoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael sat on the edge of the bed as he brushed his fingers into his hair, his frustration mounting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace knew his clock was ticking, and maybe that was the reason he couldn&#39;t say anything. He hated the fact that he was being timed to say what he had to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. Get out,&#34; Kael said as he stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;K,come on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t make me drag you out, Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grabbed his hand, attempting to pull him out of the room, but Jace wasn&#39;t about to make it easy for him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! Just let me fucking say something!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You had your time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael,please!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Beta halted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I didn&#39;t mean to. Okay? I don&#39;t know how you found out, but it was never my intention to hurt your feelings.&#34; He pulled his hand free from Kael&#39;s. &#34;I never thought I&#39;d actually fall for a man. Even when the relationship between us got serious, I still thought it a joke and that it&#39;d end in no time like my other relationships. But then... I started feeling things I&#39;d never felt for anyone before. It kept getting serious until I was so fascinated by everything you did. Yet,foolishly, I thought it still wasn&#39;t right. I thought I was always meant to end up with a girl, you know?Because you...you were my first man. But gradually, I noticed that girls stopped amusing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, that day, I decided to do something stupid.It was more like a test to me. But I wanted to see if I could still get attracted to a woman. I met up with thisgirl,we had sex, but that was all it took for me to know my choice was sealed. I-I didn&#39;t even get to finish on her.Believe me, there was nothing amusing about it and all I kept envisioning was you. Please, Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped forward. &#34;That was as far as it went. From that day, I swore never to have anything to do with a woman again. I came to the realization that you were enough. It... It actualy made me happy &#39;cause I was finally able to understand myself. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d find out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael scoffed as he paced to the window. &#34;So,this was the reason you wouldn&#39;t even have sex with me.You weren&#39;t ready to accept your sexuality and thought you were better off with a woman.&#34; &#34;Yes! But that was before I clarified my thoughts. It&#39;s in the past now, believe me. All I want is you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should be easy for you to say since you&#39;ve been caught.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. No, don&#39;t say that. I mean it, dude.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute, Kael remained quiet, his arms crossed.Jace held his gaze with pity-seeking ones, letting him know he held all the cards in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; he went closer, his heart beatng really fast. &#34;I swear on my life, it&#39;s never going to happen again. You can ignore the world, but not me, K. I don&#39;t deserve this treatment from you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For one more minute, Kael said nothing,still;simply holding his gaze. Slowly, a foreboding twinkle shimmered in his eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You sure you&#39;re sorry?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course!|-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you go on your knees and show me,then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The most important day of our lives finally came. The day of the final trial. The day that got to decide the next generational Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t sleep the previous night-Jaris and I. We laid in bed and kept picturing the day and what our reactions would be when he got announced the winner. I told him I couldn&#39;t wait to see him leading every other Alpha. In my heart, I promised to be a supportive Luna for the remaining months we had together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The remaining months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I always avoided thinking of that as much as I could,and Jaris and I never do mention it when we were together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked out the new dress I&#39;d gotten from a Designer store two days ago and admired it. I needed something new and elegant to celebrate the evening when the victory did come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled the entire time I showered and jumped as I did my makeup. Jaris would be ready in no time and definitely taunt me for finishing late. We had to go earlier than everyone else &#39;cause there were some preparations we needed to make.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still wearing my bathrobe and brushing my hair when someone entered the room without knocking.I already knew it was him before I looked to confirm. &#34;Seriously! Weren&#39;t you ever lectured on knocking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should watch your tone, young lady; you&#39;re speaking to your Alpha King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small giggle left my lips as he approached me.Alpha King. I loved how confident he was now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unless,&#34; he rolled his sleeves up. &#34;You want that tongue to get punished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes as I looked back in the mirror,ignoring the way my heart danced aroundin joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here anyway? Can&#39;t stay away for that long?&#34; Iteased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I came to see how far behind you were. And I was right. You still have your freaking hair down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ugh. But I&#39;m almost done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the brush and faced him. &#34;You ready for today, right?&#34; | resisted the urge to touch him. Being with him,I wanted to touch him all the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am. Ready to be King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sounded like the proud Jaris I knew. The one who knew he was bound to win at everything. It was the man I fell for. &#34;And I am ready to be Grand Luna,&#34; I giggled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart hit the floor when I didn&#39;t get the reaction I expected from him. He tried to mask it as soon as it slipped, but I&#39;d already seen it-the flicker of something sad and uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He covered it with a smile as he tucked some strands of my hair beneath my ear.&#34;Why don&#39;t you hurry with the dress? You&#39;ll make me late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the unease growling in my stomach, I smiled back at him and watched him leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d just put on my dress and was admiring how pretty it looked when a rapid knock reached my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ushered the person in and Mrs. Bastina, the kids &#39; nanny came running. Panic threatened to consume me when I noticed she was in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ma&#39;am, Lyric, there&#39;s a problem. I-I don&#39;t know who to go to right now. The Alpha would definitely have my head if he knows about this.|-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gripped her shoulders. &#34;Mrs. Bastina, calm down and explain to me. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the kids. They&#39;re gone. They-They took them.&#34;</p>
