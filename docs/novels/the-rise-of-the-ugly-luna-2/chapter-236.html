                <p>SIX MONTHS LATER</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes were on me as I walked into the huge complex, dressing smart in my grey corporate and black heels.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me, my assistant followed closely with my bag and files in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the subtle whispers of the people; the way most of them created distance between us like I was a walking poison.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding my head high and maintaining a straight face-the one I maintained when I acted like the people around me didn&#39;t exist-l walked into the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I came out of the eleventh floor and met the same reaction from the staff there. All of them stopped working,rose to their feet and kept their heads bowed as I walked through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Lyric! We um...we were not expecting you, ma&#39;am,&#34; Gregory&#39;s assistant said with trembling courtesy as he scurried beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is your boss in his office?&#34; I demanded without looking at him or breaking my stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes,ma&#39;am. But he&#39;s in a m-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, stop following me. I didn&#39;t come here for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He obeyed while my assistant continued the walk to the office that was just in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed the door open to a group of people in suits gathered in his office. Obviously, they were having a meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gregory was right at the head, his eyes threatening to burst out at the sight of me. &#34;L-Lady Lyric!&#34; He bolted upright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of the men in the room looked as uncomfortable as he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need the room with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men didn&#39;t wait. They gathered their things and filed out of the office, leaving Gregory with me and my assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched his Adam&#39;s apple bob as he swallowed hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;T-To what do I owe this visit, My Lady? Would you like some tea?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Gregory. Thank you.&#34; I ensured my voice remained business-like as I approached his table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh... I&#39;ve been trying to reach the King. It&#39;s been impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was Caden. He&#39;s crowned himself King and made the people refer to him as one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m aware of that. Actually, that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m here. He sent me to deal with you personally. Why don&#39;t you take a seat, Gregory?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shiny veil of sweat rested on his temples. He nervously rubbed his hands against his suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, Gregory. Take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how formal I sounded, he knew that something bad was about to happen to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he sat. But his anxiety seemed to grow when I walked round the table to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think you know why I&#39;m here, Gregory.&#34; I circled his chair slowly, running my fingers along the edge of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched how he tensed from the close proximity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, why don&#39;t we cut to the chase and make this a whole lot easier for us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lady Lyric, please. There&#39;s been a misunderstanding. I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The records were carefully reviewed by Caden himself. Those funds are missing, Gregory. And I think everyone knows by now how much Caden hates thefts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I didn&#39;t take anything! This is the reason l&#39;ve been trying to get to the King to explain to him. I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words were cut off when I grabbed his wrist, tightening my hand around it. He gasped instantly, his eyes going wide in horror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you already know what&#39;s happening to you,&#34; my voice remained calm as I siphoned the oxygen from his brain alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, I&#39;d improved over the past six months and could siphon specific areas if I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Siphoning oxygen from the brain alone would keep him alive for the meantime but make him feel like he was going into a terrible trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was it they said again? With more practice came perfection. Thanks to Caden for constantly using me as his human weapon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to take my hand off yours, Gregory; but onlyon the condition that you&#39;ll tell me nothing but the truth. If you lie to me again, you won&#39;t get another chance. Nod if you understand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mouth was wide open as he drew in deep gasps of air and looked like he was suffocating. With difficulty,he managed to nod, so I let him go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned against the edge of the table, crossing my arms casually like I didn&#39;t just try to kill him. I gave him some time to catch his breath and regain stability.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, let&#39;s talk. What happened to the funds?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifteen minutes later, I was done with Gregory and exited the building. The funds would be recovered and sent to Caden. Then he could do whatever he wanted to Gregory. It was out of my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like to grab some food, ma&#39;am? It&#39;s lunch time,&#34;my assistant said as we settled in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned on my laptop, not looking at her. &#34;I&#39;m fine, Bianca.&#34; Getting to Céleste Couture where I was the CEO, I made my way to my office, telling Bianca I didn&#39;t want to be disturbed for the next one hour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was exhausted. Gregory was the third man I had to visit today on Caden&#39;s orders, and I still had one more to visit in the evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated being his messenger-the one he sent when he wanted to kill someone or get results he knew would take longer with his men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was crazy how for the past six months, Caden had gradually made himself King over these people.Well,I was sure they saw it coming when they made the decision to split from the high ranks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They called themselves The Dregs. The numbers had been quite large. Although, Caden ruled with an iron fist, he had made the place prosperous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the people were very scared of him. He wasn&#39;t your regular King-not the type you could reason with when you had issues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only way he&#39;s managed to keep everyone under his foot was by being nice to their Alphas. He gave them treatments that made them feel like Kings, hence, their people couldn&#39;t object even when Caden treated them badly. The guy was worse than a snake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Opening one of the drawers in my office, I took out a file, flipped it open and pulled out the picture I had hidden in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the stress of the day seemed to vanish-like it always did-as soon as my eyes met with it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the file and held the picture with both hands. A smile touched my lips as I ran my fingers along the curves of the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a picture of my kids, holding hands as they walked out of their school together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla was pulling at Xylon&#39;s ear with a pout, probably upset with something he did. And her brother,always the cold one, didn&#39;t seem to mind her or feel a thing she did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i laughed at the thought of it. I couldn&#39;t think of a more perfect picture. Gods, I missed them so much. But it brought me so much joy to know they&#39;ve been doing fine over there.They were the reason l&#39;ve been able to stay sane despite the madness surrounding me. The reason I&#39;ve been able to live through each tortuous day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tear escaped my eye, joining the smile on my face. Holding the picture to my chest, I leaned back in my seat and dozed off.</p>
