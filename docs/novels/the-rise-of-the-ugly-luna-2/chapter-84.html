                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, I left the man&#39;s room feeling more troubled. Guinevere was waiting just around the corner and watched me with beady eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you cry?&#34; She looked confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled, shaking my head. &#34;The man and I...we just had a light talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what did he say? Did you treat him? I&#39;m confused because Marta insisted it was her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was so difficult. But I needed to start clearing my tracks if I wanted to live.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was Marta. Yesterday, while going on my rounds,I briefly checked on Mr. Pete. I didn&#39;t know he was already regaining consciousness. That must&#39;ve been when Marta already... you know? Worked on him. was the first doctor he saw. So, he just concluded it must be me.&#34; It was getting easier to lie by the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Definitely not a good thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. I see.&#34; Guinevere nodded. &#34;Did he say anything else,though?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard. &#34;Yes. Just about how lonely it was when he was in coma. He&#39;s fine now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We started walking, heading to our offices.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you fine, Lyric? I noticed you&#39;ve been trying not to limp,&#34; Guinevere asked, making my heart skip a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has it been obvious? How did I not notice?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I....&#34; I licked my lips. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. I just hurt my leg this morning.But I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I was not fine. I needed to understand why my dream was having a physical effect on me. I got home by morning. I was exhausted and desired nothing but a warm bath and some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got a text from Juan, asking me if I had plans for the evening or could spend time with them. I was distracted texting her back and didn&#39;t realize the person coming before me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I noticed and decided to look, my bag nearly fell from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was so close. If I hadn&#39;t looked when I did,we&#39;d have bumped into each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was what confused me. He was coming my way, knew I was distracted, yet didn&#39;t try to step out of the way. Did he want me to bump into him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I adjusted the strap of my bag, lowering my eyes to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Alpha.&#34; I noticed his eyes lingering on my face.Well, there was nothing to look at. I was as exhausted as anyone could be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply nodded and walked past me, not breaking his stride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael was behind him and gave me a curt nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing Kael,I realized I was forgetting something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha!&#34; I spun around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped walking and turned to him. This time,l was forced to look into his face. Geez. I was really hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to stare at him. It was killing;especially with the sexual memories flooding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I wanted to thank you for yesterday. The clothes.&#34;I took a dry gulp when I finished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still found it a little strange that he did that. He was always so grumpy toward me that his acts of kindness felt suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like the first time,he simply nodded and continued on his way. I was forced to roll my eyes. Grumpy ass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It sent shivers down my spine at the thought of having sex with this man in the dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bathed, ate and slept for a couple of hours.When I was well-rested, I headed to the kids&#39; roomn,knowing I had something important to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the nanny I was hoping to meet was there. Mrs. Bastina had been taking care of the kids since they were born. If anyone could give me answers on their birth, it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids, like always, were happy to see me. I helped them with their homework and chatted with Mrs.Bastina afterward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon was feeling much better. In no time, he&#39;d be completely healed and I&#39;d be free to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still surprised that my powers were yet to completely siphon his sickness away. When the kids were busy playing games,I confronted Mrs. Bastina with my very important question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Were you here when the kids were born?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She replied without hesitation. &#34;Not at all. But I was here even before Marta returned from Oryndor where she had the twins. I was already here and waiting to assist her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a nervous gulp. Jace was right. She didn&#39;t have the twins in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay... But did you know when Marta was pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course,&#34; she chuckled. &#34;I&#39;d been working here as the head maid for six years before then.I was here even before Marta met with the Alpha. So,I know everything about her relationship with him. Including when she became pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gazed up at the ceiling, a small smile touching her lips as if replaying the memory. &#34;I remember everyone being so happy, then. It was a good time in Darkspire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah,I could imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when did she leave the country?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My question brought her down from her haze.&#34;Oh.When she was about four months gone. She and Luna Isolde were always having issues, you know?The Luna never really liked her despite being pregnant with her grandchildren. Marta was exhausted and insisted on having the kids in a calmer environment with her mother. Alpha Jaris did not object.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At four months, it was normal not to have a bump.So, if Marta wasn&#39;t pregnant, they wouldn&#39;t have any idea since she left at four months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did anyone...actually ever see her with a bump?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mrs. Bastina&#39;s smile dropped. She finally realized my questions were heading in a specific direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, Luna, is there a problem?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit the insides of my cheek for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, no. I was just curious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. This was it. I had to stop here if I didn&#39;t want to look suspicious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for your time, Mrs. Bastina. I&#39;l just get some rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, we all saw her pregnant.&#34; The woman&#39;s voice stopped me at the door. &#34;From time to time,she sent pictures.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. Pictures of her possibly wearing a bump.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But she added. &#34;There was even a time the Alpha had gone to visit her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip. For a moment, I thought this was it.The Alpha would have noticed it was fake if he was there,right?But what if she had been careful enough not to let him close enough to notice it was fake? Someone with a scheme like hers would undoubtedly be very smart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a smile at the woman. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my horror, by the time I got to the room, a pack of pills was already there,waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever it was, they didn&#39;t just send one of them this time. They sent a whole pack. Like they expected me to keep taking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a small note beside it. &#39;Our little secret.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This had gone beyond creepy. These pills don&#39;t just magically appear. Someone keeps dropping them here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, when I checked the cameras, I couldn&#39;t find anything. For Moon&#39;s sake, who was doing this to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By nightfall, I was still staring at the pill, untouched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if none of this was a dream? And this stupid pill was only meant to convince me otherwise?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave it a long hard thought. There was only one way to find out if someone had been messing with my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the pill from the table but didn&#39;t swallow.I held it tight in my palm as I laid in boed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, I&#39;d understand if someone had been sneaking into my room or not and making me feel these things I think are dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,I&#39;ll catch the culprit.</p>
