                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you...okay?&#34; The woman asked, bringing me back to reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed painfully and looked around. Were there more of her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. You haven&#39;t answered my question. Do you know who she is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted back to the paper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,I shrugged. &#34;Not at all. Sorry I can&#39;t help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cold gaze lingered on me. But I didn&#39;t waste any more time. I hurried back to Maddy and told her we needed to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I was home and alone, I put a call through to Jace, my hands shaking as I narrated everything to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;ve come for me. What am I supposed to do?Who knows when they&#39;ll run into someone that knows me? Jace, I&#39;m so scared!&#34; I blurted so many words in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, calm down. We don&#39;t even know if she&#39;s the only one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can she be the only one? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more of her! D-Do you think I should run?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of running triggered a heavy weight against my chest. I wasn&#39;t ready to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just...hold on, okay? I&#39;ll go around and try to know if there are more of her. Just trust me, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace spent a long time trying to convince me to stay calm. He told me I&#39;d know as soon as he&#39;s done his findings. He wanted to know where and where they&#39;ve covered so far so he knows which country we could run to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, I tearfully told him I didn&#39;t want to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to understand that your life is in danger,Lyric,&#34; he said the bitter truth. &#34;If I deem it fit for us to leave as soon as I&#39;m done with my findings, we will.And that could even be tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, I cried for a long time in my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to leave. I wasn&#39;t ready to leave everything behind. The kids, my friends, and as crazy as it sounded, Jaris Dreadmoor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was my life so different? | felt cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of hours, I decided I needed a distraction to stop me from going insane. And the only person that came to mind was Jaris. To distract my mind from the Executioners, I decided to think of the fact that he was hiding something under that</p>
                
                
                
                <p>turtleneck of his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my keys and drove to his company,knowing that was where he&#39;d be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I sped past people and buildings, I gave a thought to what my reaction would be if my suspicions turned out to be true. If Jaris was just tricking me the whole time and none of this was a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if he was behind the pills? What if...his touch and the intimacy were real? I shuddered at the thought of being lied to and used without my full knowledge. But by him. The same man whose voice sent constant warmth in my belly. His eyes did unexplainable things to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t know what my reaction would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now more than ever, I was desperate to check for the color behind his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris owned a huge construction company-one of the biggest in the world. What was so spectacular about it was the fact that he didn&#39;t inherit it from his family but started everything from the start to finish.All by himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was a force of nature.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was checked at the gates and quickly let in when they confirmed I was his mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beguiled as I walked into the ground floor of JD Constructions. The place was a marvel with people appearing busy and moving around in haste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The building itself towered like a skyscraper, its stunning architecture glinting in the sunlight,creating a breathtaking silhouette against the skyline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped at the reception desk to ask for directions to his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am, but you can&#39;t see him without an appointment,&#34; one of the receptionists said politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... Why don&#39;t you just call and tell him it&#39;s Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the lady didn&#39;t seem moved, I added. &#34;I&#39;m his mate and Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes lit up instantly, her respect coming in ten folds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;O-Okay, ma&#39;am. Just a second,please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She picked up the landline and spoke to someone on the other line.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry | couldn&#39;t reach him, but I already reached his assistant. So, you can go up. It&#39;s on the sixth floor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled at her and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the elevator, I reached the sixth floor, the whole time captivated by the beauty of the space.I&#39;d only heard about the wonder that is JD Constructions, but it was my first time stepping foot in it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were other open-plan offices around, but it was easy spotting Jaris&#39; as it had &#39;The CEO&#39; Imprint on it. I feIt a little nervous going toward the door. What would be his reaction having me in his personal space? I didn&#39;t tell him I was coming beforehand because I didn&#39;t want him to have any clues and try to get rid of the color. Although, I didn&#39;t think that was possible. It wasn&#39;t something that&#39;d wash off until twenty four hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can I help you?&#34; The lady at the front desk asked. She was positioned just outside his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;HHi. I&#39;m here to see Jaris Dreadmoor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. What&#39;s your name? I need to check for your appointment.&#34; She lowered her gaze to the screen of her laptop as her fingers danced across the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The name is Lyric Dreadmnoor, but I don&#39;t have an appointment. I just want to see him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers paused on the keyboard, her eyes shifting to me and taking me from head to toe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t have an appointment, you can&#39;t see him.&#34; There was a cold finality in her v/oice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked away, returning her attention to her system. I frowned at her attitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you just tell him I&#39;m here? He&#39;d want to see me.&#34;Iinsisted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart swelled at the conviction that Jaris would really want to see me if he knew I was here. I was sure of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Assistant stopped typing again and this time appeared disturbed as she looked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen, I have a job here, and it doesn&#39;t involve you telling me what to do. We go by the rules here.Without an appointment, you can&#39;t see Alpha Jaris.I don&#39;t even know how you were let in here in the first place.&#34; She looked around, as if searching for security or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, leave before I&#39;m forced to throw you out myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped, shocked by how rude she was. How was she even an assistant to the CEO if she treated people this way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m his mate and Luna,&#34; I revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t the kind of person who enjoyed using the power of her name to get things done, but they were really pushing me today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled her eyes like l&#39;d just said something childish. &#34;I heard your last name, and really, I don&#39;t care who you are. We stick to the rules here.&#34;</p>
