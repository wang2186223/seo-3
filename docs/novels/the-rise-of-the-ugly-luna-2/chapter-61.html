                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone as hard as Zarek, it was easy to see when he was tensed and uncomfortable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, he did a good job masking it as quickly as it came. But it wasn&#39;t quick enough to fool me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you insinuating, Lyric?&#34; He chuckled</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Zarek,&#34; I placed my hands on the desk and interlocked my fingers. &#34;Ifyou really want to return the favour for healing your father, you should tell me the truth. What were you doing there that night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face grew tender, hinting at a buried truth. He was hiding something. It was so clear now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wasn&#39;t doing anything,&#34; he shrugged, his face turning to rock once more. &#34;I actually came with my mate and wanted to see if there was a vacancy in there. You know, that is my favorite spot. But you were already there, asleep. So, all I did was leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment stabbed me in the heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his gaze for some time before | lowered them to my desk, separating my fingers. &#34;Is that so?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; His voice was thick. &#34;You could ask my mate if you want. She was in the car, waiting, while I wvent to check.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, his chair scraping against the floor.&#34;Once again, thank you for helping my father. If you do need anything else in return, let me know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was out the door before I could say anything else.Why did it look like he was running away? Why wasn&#39;t I satisfied?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By one p.m. Guinevere was there to take me to my first patient. I was so nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On our way, she gave me a file and briefed me on what I was expected to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the surgical ward, I found the patient lying there, waiting for someone to save him.Someone who was suppress to be me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From what I&#39;d learned so far, his case was really delicate as he needed the poison extracted from his cavity area. It was really complex and a single error could result in him dying. It would be disastrous to have his death on my hands.A patient had never died on me before. I didn&#39;t want it happening now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a team of doctors watching outside,including Marta who gave me that death glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| focused on the patient and what I was about to do.l doned my personal gloves which I got from my lab coat. The assistants and scrub nurses also got ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was set, but my mind wasn&#39;t. I&#39;d never performed such surgery before. Without my siphoning powers to help me, I was scared. What if he dies on me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scalpel was handed to me. Yet, for more than a minute, I simply stared at it without using it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Doctor Lyric. Is everything okay?&#34; I heard someone ask from the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was backing the window, so they couldn&#39;t see the uncertain look in my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared. So so scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally,my body betrayed me. My legs jerked, forcing me to stumble back. The scalpel slipped from my hand to the floor. &#34;Ma&#39;am, are you alright?&#34; The assistants in the room held me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; Doctor Guinevere rushed in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She put a hand around my shoulder. &#34;What is wrong with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-| ddon&#39;t know. I don&#39;t feel too well.&#34; I touched my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guinevere did same. &#34;My goodness, you&#39;re burning up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was. I couldn&#39;t believe anxiety could have this effect on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take her to the staff Quarters. She needs to rest,&#34; Guinevere said as she handed me to a nurse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain and shame held me tight. I disappointed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How unfortunate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nurse had her hand around me as she led me away from the surgical ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching a diversion, I heard someone sobbing in the corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just hope he makes it. All he ever wanted was to see his grandchild. He&#39;s waited years, you know? And now that I&#39;m finally pregnant, he&#39;s about to die. How do l survive this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the corner, I saw a young lady crying in the arms of a man around her age Something in my guts told me she was connected to the man I just abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Agony clutched me tighter in the chest as I let the nurse lead me away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>HOURS LATER.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was dark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day doctors, including Guinevere had left,replaced by the night doctors. I was supposed to have left hours ago, but when Guinevere asked, I told her l was staying back to do some research.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was very nervous about what I was about to do. This could turn bad for me, but l&#39;ve come to understand that I couldn&#39;t sit back and watch someone die when I could&#39;ve done something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly eight p.m when I left my office to Mr.Owen&#39;s ward. He was still in the surgical ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctor Guinevere had told me earlier not to worry, that arrangements had been made for another doctor to perform surgery on him very early tomorrow. But it was still a risk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>TCH had the best doctors, but there were certain things that were beyond them. Things that were beyond the physical control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their mere hands, Mr. Owen might or might not survive, but with me, I was sure he would. So, why let them take the risk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how scared I was myself, I went into the surgical ward and gathered the tools I needed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man was deep asleep. Thank goodness his family wasn&#39;t around either.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I donned the normal gloves and set to work, starting with a Dreamweaver elixir to make sure his sleep continues.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was more stressful conducting the surgery alone,but in less than two hours, I was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath of relief when I confirmed his vitals were okay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was fine. The surgery was successful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes! I screamed in my head. I did it! I wanted to laugh out loud. Wanted to run around,screaming my progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was quite sad that I couldn&#39;t do any of that.My win stayed with me and me alone.</p>
