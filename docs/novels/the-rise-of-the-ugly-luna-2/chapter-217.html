                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace didn&#39;t stop driving until the sun was out. After long tiring hours, we finally arrived at the location he wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a house in the outskirts of a town, surrounded more with bushes than people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This used to be my grandmother&#39;s,&#34; he explained as we approached the house. &#34;I used to enjoy coming here for the holidays.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doesn&#39;t look like anyone&#39;s been here in a long time-l wanted to tell him, but my tongue was too heavy to let any words out. I didn&#39;t know how to make basic communications anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We didn&#39;t have any bags with us as we had left in a hurry. The only thing Jace had on was his phone and wallet. We entered the house which was quite spacious but very dusty. It looked like it&#39;d been abandoned for years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I coughed from some of the dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yup. We have a lot of work to do. Got to make it liveable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not minding the dirt, I sat on one of the couches.I was so tired and lost.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hungry, right?&#34; Jace asked a while later. &#34;I&#39;ll um...just head out and get something for us to eat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How long will this go on, Jace?&#34; My words halted him at the door. &#34;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re probably looking for me by now. What if they notice you&#39;re also missing and start looking for the both of us? Who will run our errands for us, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ll be fine, Lyric. Just trust me, okay? For now,let&#39;s focus on settlingin.&#34; He left before I could ask him any more questions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But we both knew there was an elephant in the room.Being on the run in our world wasn&#39;t easy; not when we had too many resources. It was even worse since I was running away from the Capital Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How far will Jaris go to find me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How can she possibly go missing last night of all nights?&#34; Cole grumped for the umpteenth time as we all stood in the passage. &#34;Today was the day you were meant to pass your judgment. It was the day she was supposed to be handed to us. How did she manage to escape?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The guards are still looking for her,&#34; one of the Elders said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She must&#39;ve been far gone from here, otherwise,they&#39;d have found her already,&#34; Cole snapped. &#34;You know, this is the reason l insisted on guarding her cell last night. I knew there was a high chance of something like this happening. But the King wouldn&#39;t let me.&#34; Now he directed his anger at me, even if he kept it subtle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been quiet the whole time because I knew talking would only make everything worse. How unfortunate that Cole was trying to flush my efforts down the drain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, Executioner, I hope you don&#39;t mind me not wanting someone like you near her cell where you could easily kiIl her and blame it on an accident.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d have never done that, My King. I only wanted to ensure-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, she&#39;s gone now, and the only thing we can do is find her,&#34; I cut him off, already feeling irritated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Someone must&#39;ve helped her,&#34; Elder Lucas said.&#34;The guards said their meal was spiked. Obviously,someone helped her with them, and also helped her with an extra key to her cell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Cole looking at Kael behind me. &#34;Where is your boyfriend?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence before Kael calmly replied.&#34;What does he have to do with this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, he&#39;s her best friend. From what I saw, he&#39;s crazy over her and will do anything to protect her.I won&#39;t be surprised if he&#39;s behind this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you&#39;re wrong. He doesn&#39;t know nothing about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you leave that for us to decide,then?Where is he?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. If you want to see him, you go find him yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Enough of the accusations,&#34; I cut in. &#34;Our target here is Lyric. I&#39;ll assign more people to look for her.For now, I need this meeting to come to an end.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked away, returning to my room where I could be alone. I needed to find her. Not because I wanted to hand her to the Executioners, but because I just wanted to see her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she escape? How could she go away from me? I know I was an ass to her. I should&#39;ve gone to see her. But shouldn&#39;t she understand how hard it was for me? My mother was dead! I didn&#39;t know how to face her without hating her. And gods, the last thing I wanted was hating Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I ever hate her when she meant the world to me? But how could I forget the fact that my mother was dead because of her? And now I have people mourning her loss and looking up to me to do the right thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>PENELOPE</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope was deep asleep when she heard banging sounds on the door. It sounded like someone was trying to break into the house. Her sister wasn&#39;t home, and Penelope knew there was no way she&#39;d be trying to break into the house when she had her key.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sprang from the bed and got her claws out,ready to defend herself. But even she knew she looked like a joke. If there were a lot of people out there,Penelope knew she wouldn&#39;t stand a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound of the door finally breaking open made her shudder.Could there be thieves? Or the people who tried to kill her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She heard them run into the house. Realizing there were more than one,  she decided it was best to escape. She knew it wouldn&#39;t take long for them to find her in her room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She dragged her phone from under the pillow and was about running out when she heard her sister&#39;s voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Who are you guys? What&#39;re you doing here?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope&#39;s heart stopped in her chest. She leaned toward her door and listened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is she?&#34; A man asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where is who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your sister. You know what we talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know nothing about my sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now get out of my house.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next sound that followed was a gunshot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope screamed before she could stop herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I heard someone&#39;s voice. Check the room,&#34; she heard one of the men order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite her distraught state, she knew she needed to start moving. She ran out of the room, headed to the library room where there was a door leading outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men heard her running and followed the sound,but before they reached the laundry room, she was already out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They ran after her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope ran as fast as she could. Her sister&#39;s house was quite deserted, so there was no chance of seeing a cab around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran into the woods, figuring it was easier to hide from the men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran until she was panting heavily and feared she&#39;d pass out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She ran until the whole scenario looked too familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Until she remembered being chased by some men before now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered why they were chasing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It definitely had to do with the kids she had given to Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes. The kids she gave to Marta belonged to Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had to stop running for a moment to catch her breath as she held onto a tree. She was breathing so heavily like someone that had fallen off a high tree.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her memories were back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids she had taken from Lyric were with Marta.This was the reason they were out to kill her.</p>
