                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A scoff burst from my throat, followed by a deep throaty laughter. Now, I looked as mad as the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found Jaris approaching me and didn&#39;t even wait for him to get close. I ran, laughing, my arms wide. He opened his arms before I reached him, caught me,pulled me up until my legs were off the floor and spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled like a kid getting candies, my hands holding his neck tightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We fucking did it, baby,&#34; he whispered in my ear before dropping me on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! You did! You did everything, you insufferable lover-king!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We laughed at the same time, my hands still wrapped around his neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, I wish I could kiss him right now. Just kiss him tight and let him feel how deeply I loved him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the background, Chairman Lyon officially announced the repeal of the law that supported executing Siphons.He announced my freedom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henceforth, Siphons were free to live like everyone else. They could work and do what they wanted, and just like every other wolf, they&#39;d be punished if found guilty of an offense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It finally brought tears to my eyes-the realization that I was indeed free. None of this would&#39;ve been possible without Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to give him another hug wwhen an angry video rose from the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is amistake!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d recognize Cole&#39;s voice from anywhere. It was too bossy and haunting, and had indeed, hunted me during these past few/ days. Everyone kept silent, making his voice heard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Siphons are never supposed to coexist with us. For centuries, we&#39;ve stayed safe against them because we never let them survive around us. I am telling you,she is a disaster! Erasing this law will give more of her type hiding out there the freedom to do what they want. Do you realize how doomed we would be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Victory had a sweet taste on the tongue. It gave me some confidence as I walked closer to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was below the stage. So, when I got to the edge, l could stare down at him and talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you really think there are more of my/kind out there? I mean, with how many have been executed before me. If there are a few of them who are actually hiding, don&#39;t you think they&#39;re hiding because they&#39;re trying to protect their dear lives? These people just want to live as much as you do. We were born into a world where we didn&#39;t even know what we were until the society suddenly wanted to execute us. In what world is that fair?&#34; Cole&#39;s nose wrinkled as he glared up at me. &#34;You&#39;re saying this &#39;cause you don&#39;t know what your kind did in the past.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, trust me, I know the story. And do you know how many wolves have committed worst offenses in the past? But wolves are not banished, are they?That is because the sins of the past people should not be used to judge the present. Because those Siphons from centuries ago were power-hungry does not mean I and the present ones will be the same.I am different! And I deserve the chance to live just as much as you do!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a loud echo of &#34;yes!&#34; and approving groans from the crowd. Before now, I definitely wouldn&#39;t have had the courage to address someone like Cole. But not anymore. Not when I knew I was free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked around at the people supporting me,disgust twisting his features.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes came to mine again. &#34;They don&#39;t know what I do. You and your kind will always be a disaster. And soon,&#34; his voice went higher. &#34;every one of you will regret this! You&#39;ll see you made the biggest mistake of your lives here today. You just wait and see!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed out, the crowd automatically parting for him. His colleagues also passed glares at me before they followed suit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, turning around to meet Jaris&#39;eyes and finding reassurance in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was fine. It was all over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, my win was not entirely accepted by everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde, for example.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She followed Jaris and I to the room and yelled about how wrong the whole thing was, and how much of a bad luck I was going to bring. She even called me an opportunist for getting pregnant for Jaris when l knew our whole relationship was based on a contract. Her words about her grandchild cut me deeper. If only she knew how the child came about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was furious and almost had her thrown out. It was a good thing I was able to hold him back until the Luna left on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What kept me going was the fact that the love was more than the hate. A lot of people appreciated mne for being a Siphon. Some even started asking if they could bring their loved ones to come for treatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, I set out to do something special.I already made preparations for chefs the previous day and paid them off to prepare a variety of meals in large quantities for the people. Then, I sent the notice out, inviting as many Wolves as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In our world, it wasn&#39;t difficult passing information acrosS.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a very busy day in the Silver Citadel. The Pack Compound was filled with foods, drinks and desserts going around in trays. It looked like a large feast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood at the balcony, watching with a happy face as everyone ate merrily. It was my own way of thanking them for giving me a chance at life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name was on their lips as they sang my praises.I couldn&#39;t help the smile on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How manipulative,&#34; Marta said as she showed up beside me. &#34;Feeding the people like they&#39;ve been starving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, not meeting her gaze. Though I knew she was angry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t think it&#39;s over, do you? I mean, as far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re stilI dangerous and I don&#39;t want you anywhere near my kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking about the kids. I finally turned to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you have to stoop so low? Telling them I was a witch and a murderer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She scoffed. &#34;What, was a single lie told? Growing up, your kind was always considered to be witches.And you really did kill someone. As a mother, it is my right to protect my children from someone like you.&#34;Her eyes go down to my belly. &#34;Even that one in there needs saving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Talk about my child one more time and see what happens.&#34;</p>
