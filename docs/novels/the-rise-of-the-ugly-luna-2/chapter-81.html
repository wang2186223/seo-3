                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shocked by how sudden the effect was. My head swirled, the room going in circles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost my balance and would have dropped to the floor if I wasn&#39;t standing near the dresser to grip it tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. What have I done? What did I take!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sensation was worse than being drunk. It was just as if I&#39;d been drugged by something heavier than my body could take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dragging my legs and swinging my arms around, I managed to reach the bed. But I didn&#39;t get to climb it as I ended up on the floor, my head resting on the edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, my heart pounding in my ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few minutes, it felt better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not just better,but euphoric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I giggled at the insane sensation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My entire body seemed to be at so much peace. It felt like I was stuck between sleep and consciousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was I in the dream already? If I was, then where was he? Where was Jaris? Where was the man that hated me,yet made me feel good in my dreams?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew the moment my door opened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊＋＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew Lyric was being tormented, just like me. 1overheard her telling her friend about the dream and how bothered she was about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted this as much as I did. But the both of us could never bring ourselves to face reality.We could never admit it to ourselves or ever let it happen in reality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, this was the only way to go about it. By leaving it in the dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And that was all it was ever going to be. A dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was on the floor when I walked in, her head propped on the bed. She was dressed, ready for bed,wearing a black transparent lace nightie. I&#39;d be lying if I said it didn&#39;t look good on her. Everything about Lyric looked &#39;good&#39;, and it bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing her in my arms, I placed her on the bed.She stirred awake, though her lids were still heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris..&#34; she moaned, lifting a hand to touch my cheek.&#34;You came.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funny how she never called me &#39;Alpha&#39; when she&#39;s like this. She was more audacious this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My name had no business sounding so seductive on her tongue. No one called it the way she does.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric Harper. Who exactly was she?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gently stroke her hair, taking note of her eyes as they go close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around me, fueling my desire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kiss me,&#34; it was below a whisper. If I wasn&#39;t so close to her, I wouldn&#39;t have heard. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dick jerked in my pants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never do this with the conscious Lyric. She probably would never want to do it with me either.But in this little world we&#39;ve just created, I wanted to do much more to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to claim her and make her feel like mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was only going to remain here, in our illusion. By morning, she would feel me but would still think this was a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But me? I&#39;d be plagued with these memories all day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she pulled me with her hand arouInd me,I gave what she asked. I kissed her. Savagely. Hungrily.I didn&#39;t have much patience in me tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lowered her lace from her chest, freeing her boobs that had clearly been aching from my touch. I took each of them into my mouth, sucking and biting hungrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned, her back arching off the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.Yes.More.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My dick jerked again, screaming to be freed from my pants. Screaming to go into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I wasn&#39;t ready. Not yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claiming her lips again, I let my hand wander down her thigh, down, down, until it got to the G-string shielding her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing it aside, I parted her nether lips. She gasped in response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Lyric. You&#39;re so wet,&#34; I muttered against her lips before giving the lower one a little bite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It drove me insane that she was this wet for me. Not for anyone else, but me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed a finger in, and her soft whimper resonated round the room. I left her lips, trailing kisses down her chest to her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked on her navel, barely able to contain my moan as I drew out deep pleasure from her lower belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I fingered her, I did well to rub my thumb against her swollen clit. Her back ifted off the bed,her toes curling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please....&#34; she whimpered, her arms tightening around me. &#34;More... More...&#34; She exploded into a scream as she came around my finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt her clit throb beneath my thumb, her toes curling. Lyric was too responsive! She was the fun type in bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her beautiful face as she climbed down from her high, her lips parted. Her eyes were still closed when she reached for the hardness in my jeans. She moaned in protest when she was met with a barrier which was my cloth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; The way she called my name. It was needy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would&#39;ve thought that Lyric would want me just as much as I wanted her? This was a nice combo.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got rid of my jeans, but not my shirt. As soon as i was back on her, her hand wrapped around my erection, squeezing hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Lyric!&#34; I hissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She bit her bottom lip, her heavy eyes struggling to look at me. She looked like an enticing femme fatale right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued squeezing and pulling me toward her wet entrance, small whimpers of need escaping her.This whole time, I&#39;d been stalling, trying to rethink my decision. But she wasn&#39;t making it any easy on me.This might all be a dream in her head, but Lyric wanted me just as much as I wanted her. In a world where we might never be able to have this to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>ourselves, she secretly wanted this. And maybe i could live with that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling the condom on, I fisted myself in my hand before thrusting into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gasped, her head falling back, her head going completely closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, Jace...&#34; The way she moaned my name... It didn&#39;t make it any easy on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drilled inside her, relishing in the feeling of finally having her wrapped around me. It was nothing likeI&#39;d thought it&#39;d be. It was far far better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been with a lot of women, yet none could rival Lyric right now. None was like her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sucking on the hollow of her neck, I forced myself to move, slowly. She was so tight, it begged the question of the last time she must have had sex.It was pure bliss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wrapped her arms around me, holding me like she would for dear life, I cradled her head while I took</p>
                
                
                
                <p>her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight, it was just the two of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight,nothing else mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Lyric hadn&#39;t betrayed me, I&#39;d own up to this and give her a huge compliment tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because she was the best thing l&#39;ve ever tasted.The best thing after five years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I didn&#39;t cum in my hand in my bathroom. I came inside Lyric Harper, the very core I&#39;ve been idolizing for weeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long time, we laid still, our ragged breaths reverberating in the room. It wasn&#39;t until it dawned on me that I was still holding her like an egg or something before I regained my senses and pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moaned from the loss of my body. Her eyes were closed now. No doubt, she was deeply asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fixed her lace, fixed her hair and tucked her into</p>
                
                
                
                <p>bed. I was just as spent as she was and badly needed to crash on the bed. If Lyric and I were a normal couple, I&#39;d have fallen asleep next to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got rid of the condom, fixed my pants, and opening the door, I stopped to stare at the woman in bed.I knew she was exhausted, as was I. Yet, she was so tempting, all I wanted to do was rid her of her clothes and take her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper,&#34; I murmured under my breath. &#34;What have you done to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For over a minute since I woke up, I remained sitting in bed,replaying the dream in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone did come.Someone that felt and sounded like Jaris. There was this continuous ache between my legs that I couldn&#39;t quite understand. But in the meantime,I focused on the unclear memories from my dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We had...sex.Good sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, my hand flying to my mouth. We really had sex. I think I need to have my head checked. Why would I keep having these sorts of dreams?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to wash off in the bathroom. It wasn&#39;t until |took my first step that it dawned on me. I was very sore between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in horror as I fell back on the bed,staring in-between my legs. Was I supposed to feel the physical impact of my dream?</p>
