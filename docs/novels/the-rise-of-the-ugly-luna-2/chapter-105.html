                <p>The weather got bad, so we couldn&#39;t fly back to Darkspire that evening. We lodged in an hotel, and I took my time, explaining to Kael and Nerion how important it was to really find the scarred lady now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t believe she was a Siphon. Something forbidden. And I&#39;d slept with her. Fallen for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it possible she was working with my brother?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It fucking hurt. It troubled me so deeply I couldn&#39;t sleep through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, we flew to Darkspire. It wasn&#39;t until we arrived that I got to think of Lyric and the fact that she wasn&#39;t here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts of the Siphon had taken residence in my head yesterday. Now more than ever, I wanted to find her and understand what happened. More importantly,I needed to find her before the Executioners did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****	****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How many surprises could I get in twenty-four hours?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, it was Lyric rejecting my present. Next, it was the old Selestia saying shit about me in front of everyone. Then,I got the most shocking revelation that the lady I&#39;d desperately been looking for for the past five years was a Siphon and was likely working with my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I honestly thought that was the worst and would be the last. But nothing prepared me for the sight I met in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right in front of me as I walked into the house was Maddy,my little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,not so little since she was twenty-one,but she&#39;d always been so tiny, one could think she was sixteen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing behind was my mother, looking uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze at the door, trying to see if everything was merely my imagination. Was Maddy really in front of me? How was she back?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Brother Jaris,&#34; she was called the name with mockery her lips titling up in a smirk. &#34;I have been waiting for you. For hours now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hours. So,she must have returned this morning. And I didn&#39;t know about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mother?&#34; | tried to keep my cool as I looked at her.&#34;Care to explain what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My control was about to snap. This shouldn&#39;t be happening. Handling Maddy&#39;s craziness wasn&#39;t in my books.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry. I had to get her back, Jaris. She&#39;s been there for too long,&#34; Mother said with a guilty face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m right here!&#34; Maddy squealed. &#34;Why don&#39;t you just talk to me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned my gaze to her. She looked older than the last time I saw her. Well, that was five years ago if we were counting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was glad she looked even more beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brown hair was so long they nearly touched her waist, and her silver eyes-just like mine-shun really bright now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy had always been a pretty girl. Too bad she lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the death of our father and our brother&#39;s disappearance, she went all psycho. Nobody knew what was wrong with her, but mother and I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She&#39;s always had it in her from birth. It was her own &#39;effect.&#39; but she&#39;s always had it under control. Except when everything happened ten years ago, she finally lost her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned on me, blamed me for everything, and was always looking forward to hurting me. Except when she couldn&#39;t kill me-because she loved me too much as her brother-she started hurting others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was the reason I left the scarred lady at the hotel that day. I&#39;d gotten a call from Kael, telling me to hurry over as Maddy was killing people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I arrived, she&#39;d killed four people. Though,she was already chained up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>According to her, they tried to kill her and she was only defending herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was chaotic then. The families of the people she killed wanted justice, but of course, I couldn&#39;t hurt my little sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We truly believed she&#39;d lost her mind and had to send her away to a mental facility to get better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got used to her absence and the peace that came with it, that even when the doctors insisted she was fine and desperately wvanted to come home, I refused it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But obviously, mother found a way around it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, Maddy was right here, giving me that devil stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t think she was better. &#34;Did you miss me, killer?&#34; She smirked, giving me that creepy look I always hated on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To anyone else, she might look intimidating. But she&#39;s still Maddy. I fucking held her when she was born.Right now, she was so small I could break her with my bare hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| was supposed to be home more than a year ago.&#34;Cold rage bled into her voice as she came toward me.&#34;You made sure they didn&#39;t let me out. Even when I tried to run, you made sure they always caught me and had me chained.How dare you?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was faster than I thought. Next thing I saw was her hand coming at me with a blade in it. Before I could react, she managed to get me right in the chest,just below my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness! Maddy!&#34; Mother was on her as soon as she could, but her daughter easily shrugged her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe Maddy had gotten a lot stronger than she was five years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pushed the blade deeper and I got hold of her wrist, bringing a stop to her movement. With a shove,I pushed her back, so hard she landed on her butts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah, she might be strong, but she was still too little to me. &#34;Get a grip on yourself, Maddy. Don&#39;t make me hurt you,&#34;I warned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael,who had been watching from the door quickly went out. I had no doubt he was going to get Nerion.He was the only one who could ever handle her madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hurt me?&#34; She chuckled without humour as she got to her feet. Mother was in front of her,putting herself between us. But I didn&#39;t think there was much she could do if Maddy wanted to hurt me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been hurting me for the past ten years,asshole! Since you killed my father and brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy! Watch what you say!&#34; Mother scolded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I winced from the sting in my shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck,the little brat must have poisoned the blade.</p>
