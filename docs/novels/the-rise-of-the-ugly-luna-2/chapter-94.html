                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris wouldn&#39;t say a word the entire ride home. But he looked pissed. Very pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did that mean the result wasn&#39;t good? Were the kids not his?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the Pack, he asked for Jace and Marta. But while Jace was in, Marta wasn&#39;t. He called her and ordered her to get to the Pack House immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Jace asked when we were alone on the balcony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| don&#39;t know. The results are out, and he&#39;s been acting all weird.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind went to the kids who were already in their room. Was this the point where their lives went bad?Gods. What would Jaris do about them not being his?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After waiting for a long time, Marta did come. We all met in Jaris&#39; office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde, Kael, Nerion and some other guards were there as well. Marta looked so scared. Jaris, seated in front of his table, had his hands clasped together. It took him sometime before he spoke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The results are out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tension in the room rose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up, his eyes pinned on Marta as he walked toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small whimper left her lips as she took a step back.She was nearly shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris,please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris stopped in front of her, tucking his hands in his pockets. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, Marta. For doubting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time froze in place. Confusion filled the faces of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were right. I never should&#39;ve listened to him.&#34; He looked at Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. What was going on? What was the result?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, talk to me. What is the result?&#34; Luna Isolde demanded impatiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The kids are mine.&#34; Jaris kept his heated gaze on Jace.&#34;The result was positive.&#34; I didn&#39;t miss the shock and confusion that covered Marta&#39;s face. Jace&#39;s mouth dropped open in shock. My heart flipped in both relief, surprise and fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was scared for Jace as much as I was confused. Did he lie about the whole thing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a split second, Jaris was onto Jace, punching him in the face. I ran to them immediately, holding Jace back from retaliating in any way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, don&#39;t touch me like that!&#34; Jace growled,his lip bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was still pissed. &#34;You dare lie to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t. Okay?! I don&#39;t know how the hell the test came back positive, but I know what I saw. Marta was never pregnant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, you keep lying and I&#39;ll do things that&#39;ll mnake your father weep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put my hands on Jace&#39;s chest, trying to calm him down. This didn&#39;t look good. I didn&#39;t even know how to feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lock him up!&#34; Jaris ordered the guards in the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were on Jace in a minute, dragging him away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,goodness.&#34;Alpha Jaris, please!&#34; | quickly went to Jaris who was already walking back to his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta burst into tears, burying her face in her palms.Luna Isolde shook her head and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;P-Please. I think this was all a misunderstanding,&#34; I pleaded with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it wouldn&#39;t mean well for Jace if he was locked up here. Jaris could hurt him in a lot of ways. And the Alpha wasn&#39;t a good man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Everyone, out!&#34; Jaris ordered, angrily grabbing a file from the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; Marta whimpered. &#34;Thank you for giving me your trust again, Jaris. I am so glad you finally see the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried out of the office. Nerion went next, but Kael stayed behind with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha,please...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your friend is not getting away with this, Lyric.&#34; Jaris glared at me. &#34;Do you even know what I went through for the last four days? I was torn between liking and avoiding my own kids. Do you know how hard it was to avoid their calls when they called because I didn&#39;t know what to say to them? Because I was conflicted?&#34; &#34;Iknow,Alpha! l was at the house, remember? It&#39;s just...&#34;I huffed. &#34;Jace wouldn&#39;t do this. It&#39;s... It&#39;s not like him to lie about things. He&#39;s never lied to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s obvious you don&#39;t know your friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please.J-Just get him out and we can talk about this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And what makes you think I want to talk about this?&#34;His stare turned serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked too cold. Gone was the sweet man I&#39;d been with for the past two days. This one didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked everyone to leave, Lyric!&#34; He rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered from the hostility in his voice. I finally turned and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was home again. She was with her family when she got called by Jaris, demanding she came over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had contemporary running away, but her grandmother forced her to go answer to him, lettìng her understand that Jaris would come after the entire family if she did run.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They assured her they&#39;d come up with an excuse to rescue her from Jaris&#39; wrath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What Marta never expected was for the test to come out in her favour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. She knew something was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace hadn&#39;t been lying. She was never pregnant for Jaris but had gotten the kids from someone in Oryndor. That result should&#39;ve never been a match.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?&#34; She asked her parents as soon as she found them in the living room. Her grandmother was just climbing down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re you here? I thought you&#39;d be locked up or something?&#34; The aged woman asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you do something,Grandma?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Something like what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like... manipulating the result or something. Did you find a way to get to the doctor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you saying? We all agreed that was impossible.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is going on? Talk to us!&#34; Her father urged. Marta brushed her fingers through her hair as she started pacing the room. The whole situation was making her lose her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The result was positive!&#34; She shouted, stopping to look at her. &#34;T-The DNA. The kids belong to Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence blanketed the room. They all looked at each other in awe.</p>
