                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34; Jaris shouted my name, but I didn&#39;t spare him a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Penelope was already across the road. It was her-short brown hair, body like a model even though she was an advanced woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back when I was with her, I always let her know she was very beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a struggle crossing over to the other side of the road. I jostled against the crowd and managed to get over, but Penelope was already getting into a car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope!&#34; | screamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t think she heard me. She wouldn&#39;t even look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to make my way toward her, but the crowd kept acting as a painful barrier, slowing me down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart crashed over as I watched her car start moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was getting away. I was going to lose her!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization made me want to cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I continued struggling with the crowd but was forced to stop when a strong hand wrapped around my elbow,pulling me back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34; Jaris called with sternly. He looked pissed.&#34;What the hell are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my gead, turning back to Penelope. But I was too late. Her car was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes shone with tears as my loss registered in me.I lost her. After five years, I was so close for the first time.I wanted to know where my kids were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need an explanation, Lyric. Why did you just run off like that? Do you realize how dangerouus it is? And who the hell is Penelope?&#34; Jaris&#39; harsh grip on me reminded me that he was pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lips parted but no words formed. All I could think about was the fact that I lost Penelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took-or rather dragged-me back to the car. With every will in me, I fought back my tears. We still had the meeting to attend to. I couldn&#39;t ruin my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and Nerion had also been out of the car but came back in with Jaris and me. Jaris turned on his seat to face me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, give me a damn explanation!&#34; He rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes, inhaling deeply and refusing to urge to sink my claws into my hair. It&#39;d ruin my look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I finally found something to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re going to have to do better than that. Who&#39;s Penelope? Who were you after?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked him in the eye and a helpless tear finally came through. But it was just one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Jaris. How do I tell him I was only fighting for our dead kids? To know where they&#39;d been laid to rest so I could pay them visits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finding Penelope was beyond just finding my babies &#39; grave. I wanted to make up for all the pain I went through when I lost them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had nearly lost my mind and was so desperate to have them in my arms again. It was worse than a drug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hurt to do this alone. To know I was all alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I drew in a deep breath as I looked away.&#34;Can we just... Can we just go?&#34; Jaris gave me a long stare. But after that, Kael started the car and we were back on the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took my eyes to the window as I wiped the lone tear from my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊＋</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how hard I tried, it seemed I could never understand Lyric Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused by how panicked her jumping out of the car made me. Seeing her running there with her gown and heels while the cars got ready to hit the road made my stupid heart race.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody should have this effect on me. And yet, I ran after her without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t see who she was after. Heck, there were too many people on the road. But this Penelope must be important enough for her to risk her life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fisted my hands, trying to remain calm as we drove to the meeting hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only the Sovereign Alphas were present for the meeting. If I could have my way, I wouldn&#39;t come to these meetings at all. But what could an aspiring Alpha King do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric sat beside me, same way the Lunas of the other Alphas sat beside their men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were some shitty Alphas I wished I didn&#39;t have to see. People like Zarek and his mate, Chloe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course,Lyric&#39;s shitty ex-Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was with another woman-Nora, Lyric&#39;s sister.Looks like they both ended up together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it didn&#39;t look like the bastard had moved on yet as he kept glaring at Lyric and I. Like his glares could cause me any harm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes drifted toward Lyric from time to time. Her body was the only thing present. I doubted she couuld hear a single thing being said in this place or even acknowledge anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked pale and a little shaken, her fingers interlocked under the table. Her eyes, they looked distant. I&#39;d never seen Lyric this way before. Who the fuck was this Penelope woman? What did she mean to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an excruciating couple of hours, the meeting finally came to an end. I had this stupid urge to grab Lyric&#39;s arm and pull her to her feet. But like I said, it was stupid. So, I didn&#39;t do it. She was not a baby. She could very much walk by herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed she looked relieved as soon as we reached the car, like she didn&#39;t have to pretend anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you ready to talk now? Can you tell me who this woman is?&#34; | demanded, a little calmer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to explode on her. She looked too pale,I doubted she&#39;d be able to take any of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, she still wouldn&#39;t utter a word. And it was getting on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Exhaling a deep breath, I ordered Kael to drive us home.</p>
