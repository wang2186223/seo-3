                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I learned of Caden&#39;s return, it was the first time I prayed so hard to actually meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped in front of the temple and hurried out of the car. My instincts had told me to come here, and if he wasn&#39;t in, I wouldn&#39;t know what to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into the old abandoned temple and to my relief,there he was, smoking in front of the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face lit up when he turned and saw me, a smile forming on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You came.&#34; He put the cigarette out. &#34;You have no idea how long I&#39;ve been waiting for you. It&#39;s been two days.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood in the middle of the room, my eyes on him.Violent thoughts were running through my mind. So many images of what I could do to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do?&#34; My voice was calm despite the war raging in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;You&#39;d have to be specific.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Two nights, two dead people.&#34; | took some steps forward. &#34;Their blood was drained, something a Feeder would do. So, I ask again: what did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please. I hope you&#39;re not trying to put this on me and my people. Believe me, l&#39;ve made sure they stayed put over the last few weeks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head was getting messier by the second. There was no telling what I&#39;d do next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he smirked, I knew what he was about to say next. &#34;You don&#39;t think it was you, do you? I mean,doesn&#39;t it look a bit familiar? No bite marks. Just a cut with the blood drained.&#34; He tsked. &#34;If I remember correctly, that was exactly how you enjoyed your meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened fast. I was on him the next second,grabbing him by the collars and pushing him roughly until his back slammed against the wall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l kill you, Caden. This instant if you don&#39;t tell me what you did to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do much, Jaris,&#34; he shrugged.&#34;All I did was remind you of the man you used to be. The man you used to love but have been trying so hard to keep buried. And I did so with some drops of blood in your wine at the diner. It was so nice you didn&#39;t even notice.You missed it that much, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realization dawned on me like a cold blanket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew it. I knew something had been off that night.Something about my entire meal had been off and my gut kept telling me to stop eating. But | didn&#39;t listen;too mesmerized by Lyric to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first time, I ignored my instincts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Caden&#39;s face,I saw red.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You hacked Lyric&#39;s phone,&#34; I muttered the words.&#34;You&#39;ve been monitoring her calls and conversations and knew she made a reservation at that diner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled again. &#34;My smart brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, the servers must have helped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And when that was done, it wasn&#39;t difficult getting a waitress to do my bidding. I simply took her husband and made her do what I wanted.&#34; He clicked his tongue. &#34;It was quite simple. I killed them both in the end, though. Couldn&#39;t have someone giving my plan away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands holding his collars were starting to shake,and it was out of pure rage. &#34;What do we do now, Jaris?&#34; He crafted a phony worried expression. &#34;The urges are getting worse by the hour. You and I know you wouldn&#39;t be able to resist sucking off someone if you got a peek at their blood right now. So, what would the others do when they learn you&#39;re becoming an uncontrollable monster, just like I was years ago? What would your people do when they learn this scary truth?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile on his face made me more sick. This was exactly what he wanted. To make me become like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And, Moon help me,he was succeeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t control what happened next. I released one of my hands and started raining punches on him. He tried to retaliate, but I was angrier. More violent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We soon got to the floor with me on top. I hit him in the eye, the ribs-everywhere I could lay hands on.l was a mad man in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hit him so much there wasn&#39;t a part of his face that hadn&#39;t felt my fist. If Caden was human, there was no way he&#39;d have survived this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left him when I figured it was enough. Although I was far from satisfied. But the more I kept punching him,the more aggressive I became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remained on the floor, using the back of his hand to wipe some of the blood on his lips</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He seemed weak. Yet I wanted him more than weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was as far as I could go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and left, knowing there was nothing else | could do to him. I needed to find help before the son of a bitch did something stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. If the Elders get to know about this, I&#39;d be doomed. The throne would be taken away from me.And the last thing I&#39;d ever do is give Caden the satisfaction of knowing he won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond distracted at TCH that morning. Thank goodness I didn&#39;t have major tasks to do and was simply checking on patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everywhere I went, I thought of Jaris. I even started to see him in the faces of other men. It became scary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why would he kiss me like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whenever I was alone, I couldn&#39;t help touching my lips and remembering how out of the ordinary it had been. He made me taste him, and oh, I loved how he tasted.Like whiskey, expensive mint and Jaris. It was the best thing I&#39;d ever tasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, my heart also ached each time I thought of it.You wouldn&#39;t kiss someone if you weren&#39;t attracted to them, right? Did this mean Jaris liked me? Had he...been thinking of me the same way I&#39;d been thinking of him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the reason I was confused and so bothered.What if the kiss didn&#39;t mean anything to him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When my shift ended and I was going to meet Jace,l decided I was going to ask him some questions when he did come home. I needed us to have an understanding, otherwise, I&#39;d never be comfortable around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met Jace in the car and we drove to the location we had in mind. Fortunately, we&#39;d been able to get information on Penelope&#39;s sister. She was the only family member Penelope had left, and getting her info had been very difficult. Even Elder Mathias didn&#39;t know about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,maybe he knew Penelope had a sister but never cared about meeting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made us realize Penelope and her sister might&#39;ve not been close. One would say it was pointless going to meet her, but it was the only lead we had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her house was a small one in the outskirts of a Pack.I was a bit nervous as I knocked on the door with Jace behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked three times before she opened up. She was wearing her pyjamas and hnad a sleeping mask over her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seriously? She was still deep asleep by this time of the day?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can I help you?&#34; Her gaze was unwelcoming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...good day, Ms. Sorry for bothering you. We&#39;re just here to ask you some questions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said nothing, but her eyes became more alert.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re looking for Penelope. We&#39;re aware she&#39;s your sister and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you looking for Penelope?&#34; She sounded defensive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows as I glanced at Jace. &#34;We just need to see her, please. It&#39;s very important.&#34;</p>
