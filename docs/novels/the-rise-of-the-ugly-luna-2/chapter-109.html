                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yeah. And that &#39;disvirginer &#39; was you, Mr. Arrogant.I wish I could tell him. I rolled my eyes instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes seemed to dance with delight now, like he was having fun or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t told me if my apology has been accepted or not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my bottom lip as I dragged my gaze to the floor.Geez! So much for trying to be tough,Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you need some privacy to keep chewing those Lips?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My gaze snapped up to meet his, and a red hue crept up my cheeks in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;|-&#34; I cleared my throat. &#34;I&#39;m only going to accept your apology on one condition.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile was gone in an instant. Ooh. Jaris Dreadmoor clearly didn&#39;t like conditions. But he didn&#39;t try to stop me anyway. So, I went on. &#34;I need you to promise me that you&#39;ll never call me a slut again,because I am not one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped beating for a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help how cute he was each time he did that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my defense, I never called you a slut,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, seriously? &#34;You didn&#39;t need to say the word.Your words defined it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled again. But it was lighter this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have my word, Lyric. No matter what happens,I&#39;ll never call you names again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That calmed me instantly, as much as it&#39;s spread warmth through my chest, down to my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All of a sudden, I felt a deep, comforting kind of peace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I muttered, my eyes returning to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez. Why was I thanking him for promising not to call me names? Well, I guessed Jaris would always be Jaris. He&#39;d always have this dominant effect on people, even if he was wrong to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked on the door, and when I granted entrance,Kael came in,holding a small bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Lyric.&#34; He nodded at me while Jaris took the bag from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; I smiled at him before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Funny how I disliked Kael in the beginning due to his grumpy attitude. The guy could actually be chill to the people he wanted to be chill with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,&#34; Jaris said as he pulled out a brand new shirt from the bag. &#34;I want to believe you&#39;re coming home today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply nodded, tucking some strands of hair behind my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it, Lyric.&#34; There was an echo of impatience in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez. What was his problem?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;Yes, I&#39;ll be back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips twistedin a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. I&#39;ll see you, then.&#34; He started toward the door. That was when it registered on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m not done with the wound!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,how professional, Lyric. You were so busy blushing in front of him you forgot the reason he was there in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, doc.I&#39;m perfectly fine now.Like you said, it wasn&#39;t that bad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could feel my cheeks getting hotter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached the door and opened it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What happened to you?!&#34; Finally, I could ask.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Standing at the threshold, he shrugged. &#34;Just my crazy little sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,he was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For minutes, I simply stood staring at the door, unable to understand how | felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within minutes, Jaris had made me feel intense emotions, made me blush from it, and I didn&#39;t know what to do wíth myself anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since I&#39;d made up my mind to go back to Darkspire,l needed to go to my father&#39;s Pack one more time to grab my things. One of them being my &#39;necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was in my room, gathering up the few things I&#39;d bought and used over the last few days when the door opened. I thought it&#39;d be father or my sister who had been here as well for the past three days. But when I turned to the door, it turned out to be Roderick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was startled, the last dress I was trying to put away hanging in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; I arched my brows at him,trying to stop my heart from raging.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore one of his dubious smiles as he leaned against the doorframe, crossing his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I&#39;d known you were here, I&#39;d have come visiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him from head to toe. For goodness sake,how did I ever find this guy attractive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No doubt, Roderick was physically hot. Anyone who didn&#39;t know him personally would definitely fall for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was the point. His personality was shit. He used people and treated everyone around him like slaves. I was his victim. Too bad Nora was as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, it&#39;s a good thing you didn&#39;t know.&#34; I angrily turned around to resume my arrangement,hoping he&#39;d leave me alone. But who was I kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been, Lyric?&#34; He sounded calm, and by the Moon,I wanted to punch his throat for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no right to act concerned. I knew better than anyone that it was all a facade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just stay away from me,Roderick?Like you&#39;ve been doing for the past weeks?&#34; | sounded exhausted when I looked at him again. And I truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And please, please, I beg you, don&#39;t ever text me again. Make sure the last time you did was your very last.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure?&#34; He chuckled, and to my surprise and horror, stepped into the room and closed the door.&#34;There was a part of me that hoped you must&#39;ve missed me,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing? I didn&#39;t ask you to come in.&#34; I did my best to keep the fear out of my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Calm down, Lyric. He can&#39;t possibly do anything.There are guards everywhere.</p>
