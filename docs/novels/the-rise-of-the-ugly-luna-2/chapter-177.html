                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A stool and a bowl was brought before me. The stool was placed in front of me while the bowl rested on it.A guard came up with a blade in his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a long stare, his hand hovering with the knife in it, giving me more time in case I wanted to back out of the test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My expression remained impassive as I looked at him.With a nod, he sliced his palm, letting the blood flow through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyes fixed on the blood, as focused as the way everyone had their eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched the red liquid hit the bowl, staining the plate like it was sharing a good meal the bowl didn&#39;t deserve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hardly blinked as I let the other memories flood me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kissing Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fucking her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having her suck me. The way she giggled. What memory could be greater than that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes passed, yet the blood didn&#39;t have any reaction on me. The only urge I felt was the urge to grab Lyric,pin her against the wall and kiss her savagely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden has been lying!&#34; Elder Lucas exclaimed, relief echoing in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, thank the gods! I knew it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sighs of relief and exclamations wwent round the hall.Now I could look Caden in the eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile formed on my lips from the confusion he had spilling over his face. To see this look of disappointment on Caden&#39;s face, I&#39;d do anything any day.Anywhere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is this meeting over, then? I have more important things to do,&#34; I turned to the Elders and Chairman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, please. We uh... deeply apologize for any inconvenience this might&#39;ve caused you, Alpha Jaris.You&#39;ll be King soon. I&#39;m sure you understand how important it is to take such situations seriously.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You&#39;ll be King soon.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That statement. I looked at Caden with a cold smile. As expected, he looked like he&#39;d swallowed a piece of lime. He always hated limes from when we were kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damm it, my damsel was right. What was I thinking wanting to let the asshole win?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Said damsel came to stand beside me. She slipped her hand into mine, and the moment she did, I noticed Caden&#39;s face growing even sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was becoming too obvious that he was affected by Lyric being close to me. What in Hades did that mean?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew he was mad, but I&#39;d rather not believe he was mad enough to feel jealous about Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; Lyric&#39;s soothing voice reached my ear.I looked away from the monster and at the angel.Her smile was contagious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding hands, we exited the hall together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were barely seated in the backseat when I grabbed her by the back of her hair, pushed her forward and slammed my lips against hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reacted with shock but didn&#39;t waste time reciprocating the kiss. Kael was in the front seat, but I could hardly bring myself to care. I slid my hand under her shirt and was so close to grabbing her boobs when she gasped and pulled away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you doing!?&#34; She whispered-yelled, her wide eyes flying to Kael and back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip in frustration as I threw my head back against the headrest. Damn it, this was too much to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kael, give us a minute,&#34; I ordered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric&#39;s eyes grew even wider, shock rolling in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?!&#34; She whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael didn&#39;t hesitate and left the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell did you just do? He&#39;ll know!&#34; She exclaimed as soon as he shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed her by the ass and placed her on top of me,making her straddle me. Her arms fell on my shoulders, the tip of her nose pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re amazing,&#34; I wvhispered before claiming her lips again. I didn&#39;t waste any time. I pulled her shirt upward until my hand was fondling her breasts. She moaned into my touch, arching her back and giving it all to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I&#39;m falling for you, Lyric-the words stayed on the tip of my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think I&#39;m finally crazy for you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You taste better than blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Better than any meal I&#39;ve ever had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You make me want to be the best version of myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words stayed in my head, begging to be let out.1wish I could open my heart and let her read this letter I constructed solely for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish she could open my heart and see how genuine my feelings are.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric Harper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman I took for granted in the beginning and never knew would become the best part of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman that was slowly taking a position that had been unoccupied for a very long time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her loud moans resonated in the car as I fucked her on my thighs, wishing this could go on forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十十＊＊＊</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wood and choco. My favorite smell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snuggled myself closer to his arms, enjoying the way his heart beat against my ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My new home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That sick feeling attacked me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sprang from the bed and into the bathroom, my hand already over my midriff before I bent over the toilet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The nausea grew worse by the time I finished throwing up and straightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34; I heard Jaris behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to the sink to wash my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come here.&#34; He was on me, turning me around to face him. He cupped my cheeks. &#34;You don&#39;t look fine.&#34; &#34;I&#39;ll be. I took some drugs yesterday. I&#39;ll take them this morning and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re still not better.&#34; He gave me a disapproving look. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t go to work today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! I-I have an important surgery scheduled for today.Please,I really can&#39;t miss it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was special. It was the day I got to have my revengge on Marta for what she did to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held his hands, bringing them down from my cheeks.&#34;I was fine yesterday. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be good as soon as I take the drugs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look convinced, still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You still have until afternoon. You should go back to sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ye took me back to the bedroom where we went back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t sure we&#39;d slept for up to an hour when we heard rapid knocks on the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brought the duvet to my chest while Jaris went to check it out since it was his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy!&#34; Xyla chirped. What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw hit the floor as I tried to think quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got off the bed, wondering for a split second if l should hide in the bathroom or something. It was still very early. The kids seeing me in their father&#39;s room by this time might paint a bad image in their heads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, cuties. How were your nights?&#34; Jaris asked,blocking the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It was fine. Can we come in, daddy?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did... aunty Lyric sleep in your room?&#34; It was Xylon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows shot up in surprise. Huh?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even Jaris seemed speechless for some seconds.&#34;What makes you ask that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| can smell her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion drew a map on my forehead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How was that possible at his age?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments passed, yet Jaris was still unable to say anything else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hii!&#34; I waved, showing up at the door. &#34;Aunty Lyric!&#34; Xyla pushed past her father to meet me,giving me a tight hug.&#34;&#34;We didn&#39;t know you were in here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I did,&#34; Xylon corrected her with a proud smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shared a glance with Jaris. He shouldn&#39;t be able to do something like that at his age. His wolf wasn&#39;t active yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you sleep with daddy?&#34; Xyla chirped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. That statement had so many meanings and my dirty mind chose to settle on the worst one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, not. I just came in not long ago to help daddy with something.&#34; Another glance at Jaris who was smiling mockingly at me. &#34;And it seems you want to discuss something with him. So, I&#39;ll just give you two some space. How&#39;s that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room before they could object or accept.There was no way I was staying in the middle of that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris came to check on me before he left for work that morning and we laughed over what happened with the children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it was time for my shift, I reported to TCH and checked on my patients.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Doctor Guinevere and I went on a round together while discussing little things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were in her office when I had to run into her restroom to throw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I was getting tired of this already. Why won&#39;t it just stop?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright dear?&#34; She asked with concern when I returned to my seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. I&#39;m on drugs. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about opening the file in front of me when l caught her smiling. What was funny about my sickness?</p>
