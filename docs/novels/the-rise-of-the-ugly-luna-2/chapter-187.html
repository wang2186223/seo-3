                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It became real when I watched Marta ascending the stage. Even she looked shocked, but happy nonetheless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank deep into the bottom of my chest;deeper than any ocean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was going to be Grand Luna. Not me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Lyric. How hopeful and stupid were you? What even gave me the impression that Jaris would ever pick me to be Grand Luna?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His joviality with me of late might have made me forget that this was all a contract. Or maybe it had to do with the sex.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I must&#39;ve been stupid too. Jaris has had sex with a lot of women, yet he didn&#39;t make them Luna. What gave me the impression that I&#39;d actually be different?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was only a contracted Luna who would be out of his life in a few months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh bubbled in my throat. But it was cold and bitter. I watched Marta show courtesy to the Elders and the crowd. Everyone was joyously cheering her. Their new grand Luna.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My vision got blurrier by the second. I knew the tears wouldn&#39;t take long to come, and far be it for me to shed any on a day like this, in this very place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I turned around and left, leaving the parents on stage to celebrate their win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it wasn&#39;t mandatory for me to stay here until the end, the sky knew I&#39;d have been out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was standing there one minute, but the next time I looked, there was no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hardly heard a thing the rest of the Elders said as my eyes kept searching for her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she hurt? Of course, she&#39;d be hurt, Jaris!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even tell her about it to prepare her or something.We&#39;d been too happy about the trial that I didn&#39;t want to ruin her mood with the news. But today, I was ready and planned on telling her on the jet, but unfortunately,shé didn&#39;t come with me. Then,she went missing for hours and only came when it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, I blamed myself. I should&#39;ve found a way somehow to let her know.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman has barely gotten the last word out before I was out of the stage, going to look for her.It was wrong, actually, as I was supposed to stay back and speak to some of the Alphas that would want a word with me. But I didn&#39;t give a damn about any of them right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the hallways, but there was no sign of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went outside the hall, hoping to find her in the lot or something. But it seemed she was just gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem, boss?&#34; Nerion asked,showing up with Kael and two other guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. Any idea where she might be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael shook his head while Nerion shrugged.	saw her arrive a while ago. Did she leave again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the wide space, hardly noticing the people staring at me. They had admiration in their eyes, and some of them even bowed to me. Yet, in that moment, it meant nothing. The only thing that mattered was finding Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew her. If she was upset, she wouldn&#39;t stick around here.She&#39;d want somewhere safe and quiet. Since we weren&#39;t in Darkspire,she couldn&#39;t have gone to her friends or family. So, she was definitely in a hotel around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to check for every hotel around here.I need to find her tonight,&#34; I instructed the men who nodded and left, though two guards stayed with me.Like I needed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out my phone and tried calling her. Just like l feared, she was unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was typing a text when Marta&#39;s strong perfume hit me in the nostrils.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris!&#34; She beamed. &#34;Why are you out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spared her a glance before returning my attention to my phone. I&#39;d never really liked this perfume on her.It was an agarwood fragrance and always smelt too strongly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I&#39;ve been looking for you. I just wanted you to know how happy I am that you chose me. I mean,I wasn&#39;t expecting it.&#34; She laughed nervously. &#34;This means we&#39;ll have to get married, right?!” I looked at her again and scoffed-at myself. It wasn&#39;t until she mentioned it that I realized I truly hadn&#39;t told her about it. Didn&#39;t even consider her opinion at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta Monroe being my Grand Luna. Who would&#39;ve thought?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Years ago when I newly met her, I liked her &#39;cause l thought she was a loveable person. That was until l got to understand how wrong she was in so many ways.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was happy she gave me kids, but I never wanted her by my side. Unfortunately, I had to do this for my kids.For their future. They were more important than the dislike I had for their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not now, Marta,&#34; I grumped before l walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took thirty more minutes for me to finally locate Lyric. That was after I&#39;d sent multiple texts and tried calling severally. Her line finally went through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where the hell are you, Lyric? We&#39;ve been worried!&#34;It was hard to keep the anger from my voice</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d actually been worried when she became unreachable for too long &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; Her reply was simple. She sounded tired too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She said nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m fine. I just booked this hotel to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Text me the address, Lyric. Now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cut the call, not wanting to give her an option to disagree.</p>
