                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. I turned to Kael who looked as confused as I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the book from him to have a clearer look. This was clearly a man. How can it be Lyric? And Xylon wasn&#39;t even supposed to smell anyone yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Except... there was a day he&#39;d been able to smell her. I couldn&#39;t remember what exactly happened that day,but I knew he&#39;d smelt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about this? You saw this person at the park and knew it was her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded. &#34;When I smelt her, I looked around and knew it was her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My grip tightened on the book. Did that traitor disguise herself as a man and came to my Pack? To my territory?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cold rage passed through my veins. How dare her!? How dare her do something this stupid!? Has she fucking lost her mind!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today was one of those days when I managed to feel happy. I was traveling for a couple of days. There was an important deal I needed to close in Singapura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart brimmed with hope at the prospect of being away from Caden for a few days. I&#39;d be free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was just zipping up the last bag in my room when he walked in. Anxiety threatened to get a hold of me, but I pushed it aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All you have to do is endure, Lyric. You&#39;ll soon be out of here. You&#39;ll be free from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ready to leave?&#34; He asked from behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was the only time he allowed me out of his sight. As long as it had to do with closing a business deal that benefited him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stiffened when I felt him coming closer. I closed my eyes temporarily, reminding myself that I hadn&#39;t done anything yet to warrant his rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped right behind me, his spicy cologne infiltrating my nose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flinched when his hands landed on my shoulders and he leaned forward, taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.You smell good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Irritation crawled all the way to my lungs. Unable to endure any longer, I shrugged him off, took some steps back as I faced him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to touch me like that,&#34; I mumbled, unable to keep the bitterness from my tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a crooked smile as he leaned against my dresser while I went ahead to gather the rest of my things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could still feel his touch on my shoulders, and it filled me with nothing but pure irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This wasn&#39;t the first time he was touching me like this. Once, he tried to go even further. If the contract he signed wasn&#39;t in the way, he&#39;d have forced himself on me long before now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I need to do to make you mine, Lyric? To submit yourself wholly to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing, monster. Just being with you right now makes me want to lose my mind-I thought angrily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods,how I wish I could say them to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve given you almost everything,&#34; he spread his arms. &#34;You&#39;re seen and treated as a Queen. Everyone fears you.You have the money, power and can always demand for anything. I&#39;ve given you a life you could never dream of, Lyric. Why can&#39;t you just submit to me?&#34; I didn&#39;t know the right words to say to him. So, I kept quiet and continued packing up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shuddered. I hated it when he raised his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know, Caden! We had an agreement. We signed a contract which is the only reason l&#39;ve been with you, doing your bidding. So honestly, there&#39;s nothing you could do that&#39;d make me yours because I don&#39;t even want to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hard to miss the disappointment that crossed his eyes, followed by indignation. It was in times like these he&#39;d hit me. But I didn&#39;t even care. He could hurt for me all I cared, it still wouldn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;d never be his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept his eyes on me for a long time before he pushed away from the dresser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gather your things and get going. You have a flight to catch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise and relief, he walked out without touching me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long flight, Bianca and I arrived Singapura.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt so good to be away. Felt like I could breathe again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a car waiting at the airport for us. We were taken to our suite where we met with Mr.Ming at the reception. He was the president of Jinyi Creative Group. and the one I&#39;d come to close this deal with.He was also the owner of this mega hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look lovely, Ms. Lyric. I&#39;m delighted to see you,&#34; he said with a smile that made his eyes smaller as we shook hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same here, Mr. Ming. Trust everything&#39;s going fine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, definitely!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Bianca exchanged pleasantries as well. &#34;The meeting is not until morning,&#34; he continued talking to me. &#34;So, you should go in there and have some rest.Please, let me know if you need anything else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure,thanks.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just get your key card.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He departed to the reception while I took my eyes around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The interior is so lovely, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ve heard a lot about this hotel back in our country. I had no idea it looked even more beautiful than people described,&#34; Bianca gushed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. &#34;It&#39;s quite pretty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes now at the entrance, I saw the revolving doors open to let someone through. Other people had actually entered through that door since Bianca and I arrived, but nothing prepared me for the very man that made his way in now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Air abandoned my lungs as I stared at familiar silver eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris?</p>
