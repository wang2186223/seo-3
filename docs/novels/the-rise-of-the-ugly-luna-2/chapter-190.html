                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I could punch myself in the jaw right now and make it hurt, I would.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated myself more than anything right now, not because I got someone pregnant, but because Lyric was hurt. So fucking hurt because of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. I should&#39;ve told her. I just knew it was wrong and didn&#39;t want to deal with the guilt. Plus, we were already cool, so I didn&#39;t think there would ever be a reason to open up about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For two days, I didn&#39;t get to see her. Though I knew where she was staying but didn&#39;t make any attempt to go near her as I knew she needed space. Even I didn&#39;t know how to face her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the coronation was the following day-as was my marriage with Marta-and there was no wvay I&#39;d be able to proceed with it if Lyric and I were still in this mood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I summoned her home. Sent some guards to get her and instructed them not to leave without her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew she could be stubborn when she wanted to be. So, the guards were permitted to drag her here if the need arose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They brought her to a private spot I&#39;d booked for us by the beach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was night, making the atmosphere more calm and peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed us to talk but also needed some privacy for us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing casual jeans and a black top with her hair flying over her shoulders. Her arms were crossed and daggers thrown at the guards behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might&#39;ve forced her to come, but I was sure they didn&#39;t hurt her in any way. I made it clear they were not supposed to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why am I here?&#34; She snapped, crossing her arms over her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dragged my eyes from her face to her belly</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her belly. Where she had my child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I still couldn&#39;t believe it. Lyric was pregnant for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dismissed the guards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, take a seat.&#34; I pointed at the seat facing mine. &#34;I&#39;m fine on my feet. You know, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could hurry up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sit down, Lyric.&#34; There was no room for further arguments in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glared at me but eventually took the seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a calming breath. &#34;The guards weren&#39;t rough with you,l hope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it matter? They got me here when I didn&#39;t want to.&#34; I noticed she was trying so hard to avoid my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.... you were forced to come here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness! Was this what it felt like being with someone you cared about? Your entire attitude changes that you barely recognize yourself?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because why on earth have I been apologizing to Lyric since I met her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I never apologized to anyone. It&#39;s just never been my thing. Yet, here I was, doing it effortlessly for this woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| didn&#39;t mean to hurt you, you know?&#34; | started.&#34;When I met you, I didn&#39;t even want this contract to take place between us. But then, things kept getting better between us, and before I knew it, I became obsessed with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went ahead to tell her how it all started after | saw her naked that day in the room. Told her how she was the only woman that&#39;s ever made me finish in bed.Well,she was the second woman, actually, but it wasn&#39;t relevant in this case.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shamelessly explained how I&#39;d jerk to the image of her, until gradually it just wasn&#39;t enough anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Told her how I wanted her, it started to hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t keep a single detail from her; didn&#39;t know if this would even create a difference. I just had to do something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last two days had been very difficult for me considering the fact that I had to be away from her.She didn&#39;t know it, but I&#39;d stationed a guard outside her hotel to make sure she was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric had evaded my dark quiet world. Now, she was all I wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I could turn back the hands of time, I would,just to correct my silly mistake. I can&#39;t-I can&#39;t have you being away from me, Lyric. It&#39;s killing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stared at me in surprise, like I&#39;d said something ridiculous. What? Didn&#39;t she know how important she was to me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you home. Please.&#34; I added.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She uncrossed her arms, lowering her eyes to the floor. &#34;Why? You have an important day ahead that should keep you busy enough not to worry about-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop it,&#34; I snapped. &#34;I&#39;m damn serious, Ly.&#34; I glanced at her belly. &#34;I&#39;m sorry I put you in a situation you didn&#39;t want now. But...&#34; I took a deep breath. &#34;You could-&#34; I paused, holding her stare for some time.Why was it so difficult getting the words out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You could get rid of it if you want to Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes collided with mine, sparkling with surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, I hate the fact that I&#39;m imposing this on you.But if you chose to keep the baby,&#34; I expelled a long breath. &#34;I promise you&#39;ll not be alone. I&#39;ll take full responsibility, make sure you two are well taken care of.And of course, I wouldn&#39;t want to be away from my child. So, nobody&#39;s asking you to leave in ten months or whatever month we have left.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe Jaris was saying those words to me. I watched his lips move, my heart beating as fast as they did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris wanted me to stay. It sounded like a fairytale,and how it&#39;d have meant the world to me if there was any possiblity for the both of us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you crying, Lyric?&#34; The guilty look was back on his face.&#34;Did I say something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I laughed. &#34;No, please. Don&#39;t mind me. It&#39;s just-&#34;My life is so fucked up. Despite your apology it&#39;s already ruined a lot for me by leaving me with this baby I can&#39;t even get rid of because of course, I could never harm my own child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, I&#39;d likely have to flee with three of his children when the time did come, which would be me endangering three innocent lives with my sick &#39;gift&#39;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he even know what I was, I had no doubt he&#39;d want me to get rid of this child himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And I should be mad at him. Despite his apologies and explanations which made a lot of sense,I still should be mad at him for what he did. And maybe | was;but it wasn&#39;t enough to actually want to stay away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How innocent was I when I&#39;d actually spent long minutes in the shower fingering myself to images of him? Jaris and I have always been fucked up for each other.Only difference was, he took his too far.</p>
