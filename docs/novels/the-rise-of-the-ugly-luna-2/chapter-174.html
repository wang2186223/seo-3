                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get a warning. My eyes flew wide open when his hand wrapped around my throat. Next thing I knew,I was on my back on the bed, struggling to breathe with his strong hand around my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He barely gave me a second to process the shock before his lips crashed on mine again,kissing me with more passion than he had the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tighter his grip was on my throat, the harder it was to breathe. Yet, somehow, he made the kiss the best thing my lips have ever tasted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand finally left my throat when I began to see stars. But he still didn&#39;t give me a break.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tore through my pyjamas, baring my chest in a second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved at the speed of lightning. Like a starved man who was about having a piece of his favorite meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I expected him to kiss my boobs, hold them fondly and maybe give them a good suckle. But nothing prepared me for the harsh slap he delivered to my nipple. What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He slapped me three more times on the same spot,and by the fourth time, it was enough to draw a moan from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This Jaris was nothing like the one in my dream, andI think I liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My nipple was so sore that when he rolled his thumb lovingly around it, it felt like a reward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His head lowered to my chest, causing me to arch my back toward him. I was dying to feel his tongue against my sore nipple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered when he darted his tongue to give a very light lick to the hard bud. The lick was so brief l almost didn&#39;t feel it. Yet, it was there enough to actually feel a thing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his tongue on the skin beneath the nipple, but never where I really wanted him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why wasn&#39;t he giving me what I wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please-the word was on the tip of my tongue. I was panting like someone that had been running a marathon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard a small chuckle as he pulled his head away from my chest. Was he laughing at me? My brain felt like a clouded sky, preventing any rays of understanding from breaking through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands glided to my waist, softly yet enticingly. And as he pulled down my pants, he kept his eyes on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look like you want to say something,&#34; he spoke in hushed tones.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard,unable to form any words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as he threw my pants away and settled in-between my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cheeks burned with shame. I couldn&#39;t believe I was so open in front of Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands came to my hair, stroking them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re so beautiful,&#34; he said the words like he meant them,his hands holding me so possessively like I was the most precious thing he had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beautiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned into his mouth when he kissed me again.I was so lost in it that I didn&#39;t notice when he lowered his pants enough for his erection to come out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He teased me with penetration for some seconds before he finally thrust in, getting a deep cry from me. His kiss became more intense, matching the deep thrusts he delivered to my aching cunt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Lyric,&#34; he breathed against my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the best night of my life. The night Jaris Dreadmoor didn&#39;t just make love to me but gave my body what it&#39;s always wanted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>*****十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moaned into his chest, my eyes still closed with his arms wrapped around mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waking up with my face buried in Jaris&#39; chest was becoming my favorite morning routine. I get the privilege to revel in his rustic scent, infused with woodsy notes and that natural smell that made him Jaris. It was always better on such mornings since he hadn&#39;t washed it off yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was afraid my heart was leading me into trouble,because why was I starting to like everything about this guy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t the only one that was starting to have detachment problems. These days, I was finding it hard to be away from him for more than a couple of hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Slept well?&#34; His rich, maple-like voice sent shivers down my spine as he spoke against my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both naked under the sheets, and I sincerely hoped the erection I felt against my thighs wasn&#39;t his cock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.You?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not really. A particular lady kept chasing me in the dream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small chuckle bubbled up inside me.&#34;Who?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t really know her name. But she had these large green eyes, kind of small in stature, and talks a lot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell? I don&#39;t talk a lot!&#34; I made an effort to extract myself from his chest, but his arms around me stayed firm, keeping me in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never said it was you. Looks like you&#39;re agreeing way too easily.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, relaxing myself deeper into the comfort of his body where I could listen to his heart beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bright smile touched my lips as I remembered the magic of last night. He&#39;d taken me so many times l lost count of the number of times I came.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was much better than the dreams. As a matter of fact, after last night, the dreams seemed awkward to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hungry?&#34; His voice dripped with drowsiness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved from the bed, pulling me along.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a little shy with my body exposed to him. Last night, the room was dark. But now, it was completely bright.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, he was also naked before me and obviously didn&#39;t care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There&#39;s something you could eat,&#34; he said teasingly,confusing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around the room, wondering if the maids had brought in food while I was asleep. But there was no sign of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t get the chance to finish my question before he forced me to my knees. I landed a bit roughly, making me wince.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand came behind my head, grabbing a fistful of hair. My throat became watery when I saw him get hold of his erection. He tapped it against my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He always seemed to have this dominating aura around him. Like a man whose words were always meant to be obeyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened wide and let him guide himself into my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes fluttered close, and I felt him stop halfway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open your eyes, Lyric. For now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed, but I opened them, anyway,meeting his pleasure-filled gaze.</p>
