                <p>I sighed as | stepped away from him to get an ointment. &#34;I didn&#39;t take your calls because I didn&#39;t want to talk to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing I wasn&#39;t looking at his face when I said that. I didn&#39;t want to see his reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got what I wanted and returned to him. I was almost done. Just a few more applications...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door opened and Evans strolled in, holding an extra saline in one hand and a clipboard in the other.His ever-present grin was plastered across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, Alpha Jaris,&#34; he said with a slight bow,then turned to me. &#34;How&#39;s it going? I was told you might need this.&#34; He showed the saline he&#39;d come in with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, no. I&#39;m almost done.&#34; I returned my gaze to Jaris&#39; chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can see. Doctor Lyric working her magis as usual.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;Evans, it&#39;s just standard procedure. No magic involved.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans was one of the nice ones. Over the month,you could say we&#39;ve become friends. &#34;By the way, when you&#39;re done here, could you check on Mrs. Lockwood for me? She&#39;s convinced her cough is a sign of impending doom. Besides, I think she could really use your magic right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,not again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Evans, come on,&#34; I rolled my eyes. &#34;I&#39;m just like the rest of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evans was one of the doctors that had watched me the day I did my first ever test and successfully treated a rare condition-which was Zarek&#39;s father. Since then,he&#39;s been insisting I was special.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he said i as a joke most of the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Whatever. Will you help me check on her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure thing. But only if you promise to stop calling me a magician.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed a hand over his heart, feigning sincerity. &#34;I solemnly swear to only refer to you as the &#39;Sorceress of Sutures&#39; from now on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help the laugh that bubbled from my chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask for a second doctor in here,&#34; Jaris suddenly said, killing our laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to find his mean look back on. The mean look everyone always wanted to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right. UJm-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should get out this instant, Dr. Evans,&#34; he cut Evans off from talking. &#34;Besides, I don&#39;t think your supervisor would be happy to know you were joking around with a colleague while she was working.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? I took my hands off his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on Evans&#39; face was glum. &#34;You&#39;re right. I&#39;ll go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What was that for?!&#34; I asked soon as the door went closed behind Evans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could ask you the same question.&#34; He angrily stood up. What? I wasn&#39;t even done dressing the wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing, Lyric? Flirting with a colleague right in front of me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woah! &#34;Flirting is a big word. Evans and I are just friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, tell me. Did you come here to make friends or just work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I closed my eyes to take in a deep breath. &#34;You should stop it, Alpha Jaris. You&#39;re starting to do that thing again.Accusing me when you know I&#39;m innocent.&#34; I angrily walked to the tray to dispose of my gloves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I turned back to him, my voice up a notch.&#34;If only you trusted me, it&#39;d have been a lot better!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around again, and for sometime, I didn&#39;t hear anything. I was about to turn to face him again when I heard him speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I was wrong, okay? I have these anger issues that make me act before I think most of the time, and I did so in your case. I didn&#39;t know you were attacked that night. You don&#39;t-You don&#39;t understand how hard it was to see you with Zarek. I hated that you were near him. I thought you liked him and let him touch you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he talked, the more I got confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was too blinded by rage I didn&#39;t notice you were in pain.I shouldn&#39;t have said those hurtful things to you.I promise you, I didn&#39;t mean them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was racing too fast. But this time, it wasn&#39;t from fear. It was from how shocked I was that Jaris Dreadmoor just apologized to me. He was feeling regretful about what he did to me. It was the most I&#39;d heard him say at a time. I could never have imagined Jaris explaining himself to me.I was beyond stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned slowly around to face him and his face was just like his words. He really looked regretful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. Jaris apologized to me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and think of something to say to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-Why would you ever think I liked Alpha Zarek?&#34;I couldn&#39;t help my face from twisting as I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been completely shocked and unsettled when he made mention of it. Zarek was not even a friend.From all I know, he was a shady man who I never wanted to have anything to do with.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I got the wrong information,&#34; he sighed, like he was exhausted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, he just explained himself to me-something he rarely did. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was stressed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His apology didn&#39;t change anything from that night,but I didn&#39;t know, my heart wasn&#39;t so strong around him anymore. It was as if the strong walls I&#39;d built around it had suddenly been brought down. &#34;Why would you ever think I&#39;m a slut?&#34; My voice wasn&#39;t scolding in any way. It was soft, coming from someone that only wanted to understand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you didn&#39;t know me before we got mated,but I&#39;ve never slept around, Alpha Jaris. I&#39;m not trying to brag, but no man can come out and boast of ever taking me to bed.&#34; I held his gaze as I said the words.I needed him to see how serious I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scoffed. &#34;Lyric Harper, you told me you&#39;re not a virgin.&#34;</p>
