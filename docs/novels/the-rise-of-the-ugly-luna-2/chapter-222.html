                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t seem surprised by my words. How would he? When he knew how much damage he&#39;s brought to my life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just his mere presence made my skin itch. It reminded me of the night he hurt me so bad I thought I was going to die. The guy was a monster. I&#39;d be a fool to think his sudden show of concern wasn&#39;t because he wanted to use me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a minute, we didn&#39;t say a word to each other. So, I started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can let you leave, Lyric.&#34; His words made me freeze at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to him with furrowed brows. &#34;You might not see it yet, but I&#39;m trying to protect you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t need your stupid protection! Haven&#39;t I been clear enough?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think so.&#34; He rose to his feet. &#34;Your bag is in the closet. I was able to retrieve it for you. If you need anything,all you have to do is phone me. My number&#39;s written over there.&#34; He pointed at a paper on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched in wonder as he came toward me. I thought maybe, I&#39;d run out when he tried to leave the room.But he was prepared for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as he opened the door and I tried to run out, he grabbed me by the hair and pushed me so hard I landed on my butts. He was out the door before I could get back on my feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth hung open in shock. Was Caden kidnapping me?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood at the balcony, watching the guards as they lined some of the offenders on their knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been a mess around here. The war was getting more serious with more people dying daily. The Pack guards managed to catch some of the people fighting; but I didn&#39;t know what to do with them yet. As a matter of fact, I was least concerned about them and focused more on the Executioners who were on their way here with my runaway mate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They called me a while ago and told me they had captured her. Finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how to feel about that. I badly wanted to see her. How has she been surviving on her own for the past one week? Hasn&#39;t it been difficult for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was also worried for her. Coming back here would mean the Executioners get to do what they want,and I wasn&#39;t sure I could let that happen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang in my pocket. I answered as soon as I saw it was Cole. Maybe he was calling to tell me they were close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We were attacked. She&#39;s gone,&#34; he said huskily, sounding like he was in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows scrunched in confusion. &#34;What&#39;re you talking about? Who attacked you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your brother and his Feeders. They killed two of my people! They fucking did!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands turned cold.&#34;And Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He took her. It&#39;s the second time he&#39;s saved her today.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, My King. We didn&#39;t expect the attack from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My view drowned in red as my sanity slipped through my fingers. Caden took Lyric. He must be hurting her.What the fuck was wrong with him?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC  I stayed in the room for a few more hours before the door went open again. I was ready to attack and strike at Caden, but it turned out not to be him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Boss wants you downstairs,&#34; the unfamiliar cocked his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a suspicious look before following him. Maybe I could seize the opportunity to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I soon realized how difficult it would be for me when I saw the numerous men guarding the place. Ail of these people were Feeders and under Caden&#39;s control? The man had been building an army around here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We arrived at what looked like a living room. By the side, I found Caden speaking in hushed tones to some men. He rounded up the moment he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here,&#34; he said with a smile as he came toward me. &#34;Please, this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He led the way to the dining which was just beside the living room. But I didn&#39;t take a seat when he did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He leaned back in his seat, pinching his brows like I was some kid who wouldn&#39;t stop pestering him for snacks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seriously, Lyric. Why can&#39;t you see this is only for your good? I&#39;m trying to keep you safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. You only want to use me, and I&#39;Il never let myself be used by you. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ll never feel safe around you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;Take a seat. You haven&#39;t eaten since yesterday, if I&#39;m correct.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The food on the table looked really tempting, and yes, I was starving. But I wasn&#39;t here for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fucking sit, Lyric! Stop pissing me off!&#34; The playfulness was gone from his eyes, replaced by the coldness l didn&#39;t like about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fisted my hands as I lowered myself to a seat, far from him. He took a deep breath, snapped his fingers toward a maid who rushed forward to serve the food.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a moment to glance around. How did Caden accumulate this amount of wealth when he&#39;s only been back for a short time? The house was a mansion. And this was only the inside. I didn&#39;t know what the outside looked like yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We ate in silence for a while. I ate mostly because I was starving. Deep down, I wished I didn&#39;t have to take anything from the monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re right,&#34; he suddenly said out of the blue. &#34;I actually want to use you.&#34;</p>
