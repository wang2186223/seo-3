                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By evening, my mood wasn&#39;t any better. I was trying to distract myself with some reports from the company when Kael made his way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anything new?&#34; I asked when he remained standing without saying a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head no, his hands behind his back. &#34;If you don&#39;t mind, I was hoping I could have a word with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him a full look. &#34;Well, you already talking.Go on.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still seemed hesitant. Why did I have a feeling this had to do with a certain someone I didn&#39;t like?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s about Jace Ashford,&#34; he finally revealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it.I knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I...know it&#39;s too much to ask, but you&#39;d be giving me the world if you could let him move back with us をagain.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And here | was, thinking my day couldn&#39;t get any worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did that son of a bitch ask you to do this again?&#34; I held the pen in my hand a little too tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! We just... It&#39;s been hard staying away from each other.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glared at him before lowering my gaze to the file in front of me.&#34;You&#39;re right. It&#39;s too much to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went mute. When I didn&#39;t hear from him for a minute, I was forced to look up at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve known each other for more than fifteen years, Alpha. I have always been attracted to the same sex but always had difficulties finding the right one. You know this. But for the first time, I feel complete with this guy. I didn&#39;t understand it at first. We started off as enemies, and then I realized I always wanted to see him.Always wanted to be with him. I was the happiest when he was living with us and was broken when he was forced to move out. I&#39;ve been trying... trying to make it wok between us. But the distance has been a huge barrier.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled, like he was about to reveal a huge secret. &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;Il lose him if I don&#39;t keep him close to me.You know, he&#39;s... he&#39;s straight. Or was. I&#39;m not even sure. But I&#39;d hate to wait around until he chooses to be straight forever. My life revolves around the pack, meaning I can&#39;t be anywhere else but here. And I&#39;m telling you,I need him close to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, for the first time, Alpha, I am asking you to do something for my sake. Please. Forgive him this once.Just for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To say I was shocked would be an understatement. It was the first time Kael was saying so many words within a short span of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cold Kael. The grumpy man who preferred using his fists to words. He had been forced into a personality I didn&#39;t recognize on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How special is this man?&#34; | asked, out of sheer curiosity.&#34;You&#39;ve had a lot of people throwing themselves at you. What is it with this very man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>0</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He chuckled. &#34;I wish I. had someone to give me that very answer. But I guess that&#39;s the crazy thing about our hearts. It beats for the people we least expect.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unknown to him, he&#39;d given me my own puzzle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was this what it felt like to love someone? You do things you&#39;ve never done before and can&#39;t even explain it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like me drugging Lyric every night just so I could have a taste of her since I was so obsessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her to TCH to face the board because I didn&#39;t want anyone bullying her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing my mind when I saw her hurt. And enjoying the sight of her in my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Did this mean I&#39;d fallen for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta placed the call for what felt like the hundredth time. He still won&#39;t pick up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;s not answering, grandma. It&#39;s obvious they still haven&#39;t found her body. He&#39;s clearly afraid of telling me, she grumbled to her grandmother who was going through a book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why is it so hard to get anything done, huh? First it was Jace. We tried to kill him but failed. Now it&#39;s Penelope. Why is it that when it comes to this Lyric woman, things never go as planned?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her grandmother didn&#39;t answer. So, she went on. &#34;I&#39;m so afraid. What if Penelope is alive and exposes us?She might...she might know we were the ones that tried to kill her and would want to get back at us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed her fingers into her hair. &#34;The kids are already bonding with the witch. Imagine at the party.Xyla had the guts to pick Lyric over me. How could she do something that stupid?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She placed her hands on her waist as she glared out the window. &#34;I&#39;ll die before I ever let that witch take my kids from me. They&#39;re mine and are trapped with me! Forever!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>주</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence before her grandmother replied. &#34;Maybe we&#39;ve been dealing with the wrong problem. Perhaps, it&#39;s timne we tackled the issue from the source.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta turned around to face her, her brows drawn. &#34;Wh-What&#39;re you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should be smart enough to know.&#34; The woman glared at her.&#34;It&#39;s time we got rid of Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****++****</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was back. I didn&#39;t think this would be possible, but before midnight, he was back to Darkspire and told me he had been given a second chance by Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I put pressure on him that he opened up and told me Kael was behind it. Apparently, Kael convinced Jaris that they were lovers and couldn&#39;t stay away from each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But how do you feel about him? Are you guys really a thing now?&#34; I inquired when Iwas alone with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His countenance dropped as he stared down at the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Honestly, l-I don&#39;t know. I mean, he&#39;s a cool guy and all, and I feel happy when I&#39;m with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay... but you do like or love him right?&#34; I studied his face closely for a reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated before looking at me and giving me a reply. &#34;I&#39;m sure I do. I didn&#39;t think it was possible,but...Kael had made me feel things I never thought I&#39;d feel for anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was saying the truth, yet I could still see that he was holding back on something.What wasn&#39;t he saying?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, I was just happy my bestfriend was back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the next morning, I felt much better. Although the pain was still there, but every day was better than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids came to see me before going to school. Jaris had doubled their security, yet I still worried for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, I was sure they&#39;d be fine. After all their school was within Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris came to check on me, and the whole time while he was talking, I couldn&#39;t help but fantasize about how much I&#39;d missed the dreams. It was insane. It&#39;s only been a couple of nights, yet I already wanted to dive back into them. Something was definitely wrong with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The day went smoothly until evening when Jaris returned. We were talking lightly when-it was cute how comfortable we&#39;d gotten each other-when Kael came in and whispered something into his ear. With how his brows drew, I knew it must be something serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll boe back.&#34; He turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is there a problem?&#34; My words brought him to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated a little before opening up.&#34;It&#39;s the Executioners. They&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart froze in my chest. My jaw hit the floor and I could only hope my shock wasn&#39;t too obvious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; I swallowed hard. &#34;B-But why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We alerted them about the dead one. We knew they&#39;d come to get her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My tongue was too heavy to say anything else. So, I watched him leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door went shut behind him, I picked up my phone and called Jace, my fingers shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,Ly-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, they&#39;re here! The Executioners!&#34;</p>
