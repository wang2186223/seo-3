                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Lyric go tense as well. She darted her eyes quickly to meet mine before returning it to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could easily read her. She might be trying to be brave all the time, but Lyric was someone that had been accustomed to fear her whole life. This fire she was always spitting was her forcing herself to be strong and not easily intimidated. She was trying so hard to be a different person.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, it left me curious. Who was Lyric Harper before now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...I am sure your son is lovely, Alpha Maxwell,but my daughter is already taken,&#34; Alpha Bennett answered, surprising the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow. Are you serious? Who is this lucky man?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Bennett looked at me, but my mood was long ruined that I didn&#39;t want any further introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;d excuse me,&#34; I gave a curt nod to the other Alphas and walked away, knowing I was leaving an embarrassed lady behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My whole life, I&#39;d never met anyone more rude. More arrogant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he walk out on father and l? Was he ashamed of having me introduced as his soon to be Luna? Yet, he had stormed into the club and ripped out a man&#39;s heart for my sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Embarrassment coloured my cheeks as father and l continued our walk. But soon, he got too involved in a conversation with some Alphas that I didn&#39;t have any interest in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to find my way around to avoid being bored. I made it to the wine counter to ask for something light. While I was waiting formy order, I felt a light tap on my shoulder and turned around to see Jace. My mood brightened up at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness! Forgive me, pretty lady, I must have tapped the wrong lady. I&#39;m looking for Lyric, and you sure look a lot like her.&#34; He said with his hand on his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed as he hit him on the shoulder. &#34;Stop joking around, Jace. I&#39;m glad you made it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you know who my father is,&#34; he shrugged.&#34;I had to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace and I had actually planned on coming together,but something came up that had him delayed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, how&#39;s it? Have you seen him around?&#34; He asked,darting his eyes around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to ask who he was referring to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unfortunately, I did. He walked out on father and l.&#34;I don&#39;t care what it looked like. To me, he was disrespectful by doing that. Well, he was at the top and probably felt untouchable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, girlfriend. I hate to be the one to break this news to you, but I think you&#39;ve got yourself entangled in a bit of a problem. That guy is the most dominating Alpha I know. He clearly loves control,and you&#39;re in for a scary ride.&#34; My drink was served,and I glared at Jace when he took it up instead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ignored me and sipped from it. &#34;Well, fortunately for you, it is just for a year, right? Just three hundred and sixty five days. Eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty hours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace!&#34; I gasped, hitting him on the arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez! We were in public. I needed to be more composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the vivid description of how long I&#39;ll be stuck with the monster.&#34; I rolled my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Monster? He doesn&#39;t look like a monster, Ly. He&#39;s the complete opposite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes again, refusing to dignify that with words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were soon interrupted by the presence of Kael.Geez,I preferred dealing with Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael was always grumpy and short tempered, while Nerion was the gentle one. I wasn&#39;t surprised Jaris picked Karl as his beta. The two were a perfect match made in Hades.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper.&#34; He kept his gaze solely on me, not even glancing at Jace. &#34;I&#39;d advise you keep your distance from men. This is a public event, and as you must know, people tend to make news out of things like this. It might get out bad when they discover you had been engaged to Jaris the whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Woah. Just when I thought I&#39;d seen the worst id it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what men have I been with exactly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are these Alpha Jaris&#39; words or yours?&#34; Jace asked with a grimace. Kael finally looked at him, but his eyes were icy.&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter to you. What matters is they weren&#39;t referred to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, sadly, I&#39;m not wearing a skirt and a wig. So please, don&#39;t tell me the men she&#39;s meant to stay away from is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael shrugged. &#34;If you think yourself a man, why not.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace huffed. &#34;I am more of a man than you can ever be,brute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? You didn&#39;t fight like one at the restaurant the other day. Or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m just a lot stronger.I hardly noticed whatever skills you&#39;ve been honing for years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This seemed to get to Jace more. The mirth vanished from his eyes as he stepped up to Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, please. I couldn&#39;t deal with this again. Not anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace...&#34; I tried to hold him, but he wrenched his hand free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure about that?&#34; He was staring Kael right in the eye. &#34;If I remember correctly,you left with some really bad bruises. Unless you want to pin it on a Halloween costume.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like you said, &#39;if you remember correctly&#39;. I guess now we know you also have memory problems.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Guys, please stop.&#34; I stepped in their middle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing they hadn&#39;t drawn any attention yet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Jace. &#34;Jace, it is the King&#39;s funeral. Trust me, the last thing your father wants is you getting your knuckles bloody here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned to Kael next. &#34;I heard you, and for the sake of peace, I&#39;ll avoid every man here at the party. Thank you.Now,can you go? Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| desperately prayed in my heart that Jace wouldn&#39;t utter another word. Thankfully, Kael left, but not without giving Jace a threatening glare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I honestly don&#39;t know how long I can put up with this,&#34; I said to Jace with frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I had known Jaris would be this controlling,I never would&#39;ve left Draconis to listen to what father had to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace had gone back to drinking, but I could tell he was really pissed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need some air,&#34; I muttered and left the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as soon as I stepped outside, I regretted my decision.</p>
