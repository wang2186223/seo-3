                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After an hour, the surgery was successful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the bullets were out and my hands continued touching him, I felt him getting better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The other doctors didn&#39;t know what was happening.Didn&#39;t know I was making everything faster with my powers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He&#39;ll be awake soon. He just needs some rest now,&#34;I told the other doctors before leaving the ward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed to the restroom to wash my hands.I was still shaking, and before I knew it, I was in tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I almost lost Jace. If I hadn&#39;t been here to save him,it&#39;d have been a whole different story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Who would dare do this to him? Jace never stepped on people&#39;s toes. Why would anyone want him dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent a long time in the restroom until I was calm enough to leave. Jace had been moved from the surgical ward to a normal room. He was still asleep,Kael beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure he&#39;ll be fine?&#34; Kael asked in a raspy voice the moment I made my way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. You don&#39;t have to worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I paused, actually taking the moment in. Kael being worried about Jace. It was strange. Though, it was a beautiful sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you tell me what happened?&#34;I inquired.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael took his time, going over the details. He was sure they&#39;d come for Jace, because, had his late staff not flipped them over, he&#39;d have been the one dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt so bad for the lady who didn&#39;t make it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he finished the narration, Jace stirred awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gasped, running over to meet him.&#34;J-Jace! Are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a small grunt, his hand going to his chest,his eyes fluttering close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell me. Do you feel pain anywhere? Just tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.Then, he opened his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine, Lyric. What happened?&#34; He looked around.&#34;Camille...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re fine.&#34; I breathed. &#34;That&#39;s all that matters,Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to be stronger than this, you know? You gave everyone a scare,&#34; Kael said, making Jace to look at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t ask you to be here. Go back to your girlfriend, wherever she is.&#34; Jace was in pain, yet he couldn&#39;t miss the chance the talk back at Kael, even as he spoke weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell? She&#39;s not my girlfriend. That&#39;s my sister,dummy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Jace&#39;s surprise. His Adam Apple was visible as he swallowed.&#34;Whatever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked at me. &#34;Camille. Was she brought in as well? How&#39;s she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My countenance fell, the words too heavy to let out.&#34;I&#39;m sorry. Sh-She was already dead on arrival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; His face crumpled up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He forced himself to sit up, even though I triedto stop him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Camille is dead!?&#34; A tremor ran through his voice.&#34;Damn it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He buried his face in his palms, his shoulders shaking. She must have been a really good staff. Of course, she saved his life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It should have been me,&#34; he lifted his face from his palm to say. &#34;They came for me,but Camille took the bullet instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes smoldered with rage as he looked at me.&#34;We know who did this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about?&#34; Kael stepped forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know who wants you dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And as a matter of fact, you know her too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, no.&#34; I put a hand on his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. Let me be, Lyric! If you had let me done this when I wanted to, maybe Camille wouldn&#39;t be dead.At least, she wouldn&#39;t try to kill me when everyone would have eyes on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand dropped from his, pain stabbing at my chest. He blamed me for this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who are you referring to?&#34; Kael insisted. &#34;A life was lost here. You shouldn&#39;t hold back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was silence for a heartbeat.&#34;Wh-What&#39;re you doing?&#34; I panicked whenever he rose from the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m going to Darkspire. I&#39;m telling Jaris the truth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But you can&#39;t be on your feet already.You have to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel perfectly fine, Lyric. I believe you also know that,&#34; he snapped at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart just kept getting hurt. It was the first tme Jace was really angry at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, maybe I deserved it. I stopped him from telling the truth and now his friend was dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stormed out of the room with Kael following.And a minute later, I did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was on her off day. She was at Darkspire when we arrived. Jace went right to Jaris&#39; office. Unfortunately, he was also home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were swollen from how much I&#39;d cried during the ride home. The kids were about to get heartbroken. Even Jaris was about to get heartbroken.Why did Marta have to do all of this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I followed Jace to Jaris&#39; office where he requested an audience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have something important to share, but I need Marta present.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Kael added that it was important, Jaris gave the go-head to send for Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha kept staring at me but I couldn&#39;t even meet his gaze. He must probably be curious about me crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A while later, Marta walked back in with Kael and also Luna Isolde.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness, this was about to get very messy. Marta couldn&#39;t hide her nervousness when she looked at Jace. I watched her try and fail to put on her mean look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. Today, she was fully terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s here. What is it you have to share?&#34; Jaris leaned back on his chair, but his expression was beyond curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta here tried to kill me,&#34; Jace began. &#34;My staff died trying to save me.&#34; He looked at Marta as he said this part. &#34;Camille was a good girl. She didn&#39;t deserve that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta held his stare until he looked away, taking them back to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She tried to kill me because I discovered something interesting about her.&#34;</p>

                <p>Jace didn&#39;t even glance her way. &#34;Alpha Jaris, Xylon and Xyla are not yours. Marta was never pregnant for you.&#34;</p>
