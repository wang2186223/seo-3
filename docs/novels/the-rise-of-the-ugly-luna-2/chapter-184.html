                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crouched to my level and yanked my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s see how long you get to put up with the show,Lyric. I&#39;m curious. Are you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden disappeared for some minutes and reappeared looking calmer. The blood on his face was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was already on my feet, my back leaned against the wall with my arms crossed, cooking up a million scenarios of how I could get away from here. Jaris might be looking for me already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What are your plans for me?&#34; I spread my arms. &#34;For how long do you intend to keep me here? I need to go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He silently went over to the wine counter where he refilled his glass. He kept his cold silver eyes on me as he drank slowly from his wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shifted uncomfortably on my feet, getting nervous by the second. The urge to get out of here was growing stronger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, you&#39;re actually in love with my brother,&#34; he remarked when he lowvered the glass from his lips, then laughed. &#34;You have no idea,Lyric,how much more you just made me interested in stealing that heart of yours from him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I wasn&#39;t so nervous, I&#39;d have rolled my eyes. The guy was a big dreamer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drank from his glass as he approached me. There was nowhere for me to retreat to even if I wanted to.So,I just sood there and let him get close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped in front of me, lifting a hand to my hair where he wrapped some strands around his fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris clearly loves you too,&#34; he murmured. &#34;Two hopeless souls thinking they could have a perfect end.&#34;Mirth danced in his eyes before he said his next words.&#34;You know, what if I actually decide to keep you for myself? Like, right now? You&#39;re already in my den. All I&#39;d have to do is keep you locked up and treat you like a slave. Like mine. That way, you&#39;ll be away from Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt like shadows were closing in around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was right. I hadn&#39;t even realized how bad this could be for me. What was stopping him from actually keeping me here &#39;forever&#39;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed tersely. He must notice my profound fear because he laughed. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, Lyric.&#34; He released my hair. &#34;I plan on making you come willingly to me. I&#39;ll make sure you don&#39;t have a choice. The only thing that would be on your mind would be Caden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snorted. &#34;Keep dreaming!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled before drinking from his glass again,emptying it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maintaining eye contact, he gradually stepped back with intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still want to leave?&#34; He walked back to the counter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Why the hell did my powers not work on him?Was there something wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dipped his hand into his back pocket into his where he retrieved a key and threw at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It dropped to the floor, and I didn&#39;t hesitate to pick it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was relieved when the key worked on the door.I hurried to the couch to grab my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should&#39;ve ran away. Just kept quiet and saved myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was too angry. And perhaps the fact that my freedom was staring me in the face gave me some kind of balls. &#34;You put in so much effort-took the kids,dragged me here-all for this?&#34; | tsked. &#34;If you&#39;re bored,you could actually get a job. The hospital I work at could use a cleaner for example.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of him, I didn&#39;t get to fly with Jaris. I had to lie to him! And who knows what was possibly going on in my absence!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I did this plainly for fun?&#34; He laughed. &#34;You have no idea, do you? &#39;This&#39; was the plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set his glass on the counter. &#34;Thanks to you, I got to know your weakness, as well as my brother&#39;s. He&#39;d be a wreck without you. And you, you&#39;re so blown by him you&#39;d lose your sanity if something actually happened to yyour relationship. You&#39;re willing to do anything for him, including sacrificing yourself for the kids he has with your enemy.&#34; He tsked.&#34;You gave me the key to breaking you, Lyric. And by breaking you,you do realize I&#39;ll be breaking him.&#34; A cunning smile touched his lips. &#34;How miserable you two would be without each other. I have a lot to plan.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment there, his words got to me. They mare me fear that I&#39;d actually given myself away. The thought of being away from Jaris was actually driving me insane now. How did I become so obsessed with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I faced him properly, forcing my head high. &#34;You&#39;re wrong. If you think you can do anything to break us apart, then you clearly don&#39;t know how far Jaris andl have come. You don&#39;t understand the concept of our bond.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good luck with the final trial tonight,&#34; his voice reached me. &#34;Jaris will be needing plenty of it,because from the looks of it, I doubt he&#39;s going to make it. Too bad you won&#39;t even be there to see it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand tightened around the strap of my bag as I turned to him. &#34;What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He flashed a grin and shrugged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re not gone in the next thirty seconds,you won&#39;t be leaving until the end of the day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was enough to get me moving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I was in my car, I laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was I even saying? How could Jaris and I be together? Had I forgotten so soon what I was? Jaris was about to become King. He&#39;d kill me the second he discovered my secret. Even if he didn&#39;t want to, his people would never approve of it, and there was no way he could go against his people. Both of us, we could never be together.</p>
