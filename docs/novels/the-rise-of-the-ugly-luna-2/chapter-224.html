                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened like saucers. For a moment, my heart seemed to stop beating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My kids were with Marta? How?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With shaky fingers, I dialed the number. Fortunately, it went through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. Oh, thank goodness you called. Did you get my text?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes.What do you mean they&#39;re with Marta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused for breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My memories returned some days ago after they killed my sister and started chasing me to kill. Marta has been the one trying to kill me all these while. She was never pregnant. She met me years ago, just before you had your kids and told me she urgently needed one. I used to be in the business, you know? Would often connect women with fertility issues with young girls that got pregnant out of wedlock. But I&#39;d already quit by the time Marta approached me and didn&#39;t want to do it. But she was persistent and offered me a huge sum of money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a monetary pause. &#34;What I did to you... I&#39;d never done it to anyone, Lyric, and I hate myself for it.I saw you as someone who was weak, vulnerable and easy to deceive. And I didn&#39;t think for one second that the kids would turn out to belong to the very man Marta was trying to impress. It&#39;s all just one...messed up string.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t realize l&#39;d plonked myself onto the edge of the bed, my fingers nervously gripping the sheets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait,&#34; I swallowed hard. &#34;Are you trying to tell me that the kids currently with Marta belong to... belong to...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t even get the words out, my panic too much for that. &#34;You&#39;re right, Lyric. Xylon and Xyla are yours.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grew wider than their capacity as I gasped widely. By the hunts! Xyla and Xylon were mine!? The whole time, they were mine and I had no idea!?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun from the information, my memories going round in a jumble. I remember the first day I met them-the instant connection and likeness I developed for them. I remember how easy it was for them to get comfortable around me too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It suddenly made sense why Marta was always trying to separate me from them. She knew. She knew they were mine, yet she forced us apart!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, I&#39;m so sorry,&#34; Penelope said as I wept. &#34;I shouldn&#39;t have taken them from you. It&#39;s a mistake I&#39;ll keep regretting for the rest of my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I hope you more than regret it, Penelope,&#34; I sniffled, rising to my feet. &#34;How could you do this to me?I trusted you, yet you didn&#39;t even think twice before seling my kids out to someone who only saw them as tools to win a man&#39;s heart. I wish you suffer beyond recovery. I wish for more harmful things to come your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My battery went off before either of she could say anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I screamed as I tossed the phone to the bed, then fell onto the bed where I wept more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They wre mine. The kids were mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods I needed to get out of here. I needed to go take my babies from that evil witch. I had to leave this place!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was mostly staring out the window and saw when Caden drove out of the house. I quickly cooked up a plan, knowing it&#39;d be easier to escape if he wasn&#39;t around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knocked repeatedly on the door until someone angrily opened up. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m hungry. Could you get me something to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a head-to-toe glare, as if displeased that he had to follow my order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be back,&#34; he held the knob to close the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give him the chance to as I reached out, grabbing his wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you-&#34; His statement was left unfinished as my powers started working on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I siphoned his oxygen and watched him gasp for air. In no time, he was down on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly pulled him into the room, took off his clothes and put them on me. He also had a face cap which was just perfect. I concealed my face with it, then ran out of the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It looked like most of the people had gone out with Caden because the place wasn&#39;t as full as I thought it&#39;d be. I made my way to the living room, keeping my head down and hoping I appeared like a guard in the eyes of the others.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made it out of the house but soon spotted some men. I kept my head even lower, making sure I was as far away from them as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found my way to the back of the house where I made it through the fence. I was out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>CADEN</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had a smile on his face as he walked into the room, pleased with the four men already waiting for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gentlemen. Hope I didn&#39;t keep you waiting for too long?&#34; He sat at the head of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas, still uncomfortable around him, exchanged glances with each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden.Mind telling us why we&#39;re here?&#34; The first one asked. It was Alpha Jaxen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. Straight to the point, I see.&#34; Caden drummed his fingers on the table. &#34;Actually, I think we already know &#34;Hm. Straight to the point, I see.&#34; Caden drummed his fingers on the table. &#34;Actually, I think we already know why we&#39;re here. I&#39;m here to offer you help. The kind you&#39;ve needed for centuries.&#34;</p>
