                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But a minute passed and Jaris didn&#39;t attack me. No. He remained completely still. And overtime, I noticed he was getting calmer, the jerks not happening too often anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wet his back with my tears. It was difficult imagining what he must be going through. Gods, I really hoped I was helping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I lost track of time. My tears slowed. His jerks completely stopped. Everything became so peaceful that darkness consumed me-a familiar kind of darkness | didn&#39;t understand until I woke up in the morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something had changed. My face wasn&#39;t against Jaris &#39;back anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my eyes and was stunned to see him facing me,his arms holding me to his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked up at his face and there were his eyes, staring deeply at me. He was awake!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha!&#34; I gasped and tried to sit up, but his hold on me was firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. I tried to move away from him again, but he wouldn&#39;t let me. He kept watching me with this calm expression like he enjoyed watching me struggle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought I told you I liked it when you called me by my name,&#34; he spoke calmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A certain lightness filled my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My Jaris was back! He wasn&#39;t in torment anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Are you fine?&#34; There was a small crack in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He simply gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. I wanted to bury my face in his chest and cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe | actually slept off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris released his hold on me, but his arms remained around me-my back specifically.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Say it,&#34; he spoke in hushed tones.&#34;My name.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My EYES gleamed in surprise. I didn&#39;t know what was more heart-melting-the fact that he was asking me to call him by his name, or the fact that he wouldn&#39;t stop staring right into my eyes, like he was worried I&#39;d vanish if he looked away for one second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris,&#34; I whispered, my heart performing a waltz,swirling with excitement beneath my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hint of a smile flickered past his face as his hand came to my hair, playing with my strands. &#34;I didn&#39;t quite hear you. I think I heard Mavis or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed. &#34;No. I said Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hmm.&#34; He raised his brows. &#34;Much better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finally sat up, but there was still some body contact between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed Ericka in the room, sitting and watching us.The scowl on her face was hard to miss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But really, how&#39;re you feeling?&#34; I looked back at Jaris.He was all that mattered to me in that moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I feel better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It worked, then. I was able to Siphon the pain away But something told me it was only temporary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be hungry,&#34; I hurried to my feet. &#34;I&#39;ll get you something to eat. Do you have anything in mind?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was sure I&#39;d be able to come up with something he&#39;d like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got busy in the kitchen, deciding to make grits grizzly..It was a good thing the house seemed to have everything in stock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t surprised when Ericka came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you do it?&#34; Her voice was clipped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do what?&#34; | didn&#39;t look at her but focused on the vegetables I was dicing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris fell asleep as soon as you cuddled him. That was strange. Very strange.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Aren&#39;t you happy it happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I want him to be better. It&#39;s the whole point of being here. But what happened...it didn&#39;t seem natural.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept mute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m talking to you! What did you do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped dicing and looked at her. &#34;Look, I&#39;m actually surprised by what happened. I mean, I was hurt by his suffering and felt he needed someone to hold him.Looked like that was what he actually needed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you&#39;re telling me a simple cuddle did something potent herbs were unable to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged as I resumed dicing. &#34;You just said it yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though, unsatisfied, she let me be. In less than an hour, I had his meal ready and served them on the dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t come to the table to eat, Lyric. You need to take it to him,&#34; Ericka rolled her eyes like I was stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.I want him to eat here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ignored the confused look she passed to me and went over to meet Jaris who had been quietly watching the scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where are the keys to the chains?&#34; | turned to Ericka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; It was Jaris. &#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I wanted you to eat on the table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;He can&#39;t do that,&#34; Ericka intruded before Jaris could.&#34;Those chains can&#39;t come off, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just trust me?&#34; I kept my eyes on Jaris.&#34;It&#39;ll be fine, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way I could watch him feed this way like an animal. He deserved better than this. Something about the way he held my stare simmered my heart, melting it like butter on a hot skillet. I could see it in his eyes-the willingness to trust me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Give her the keys.&#34; Though his eyes remained on me,I knew he was talking to Ericka.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris, come on. This is a mistake-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, Ericka. I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart burst with pride. He also wanted to do this for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grudgingly, Ericka brought the keys to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be outside,&#34; she spat and walked out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew this was stupid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whole point of coming here was to keep me chained to ensure that no one got hurt. Yet, there was something about Lyric that made me feel so certain l could never hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I realized she was here yesterday, I&#39;d tried so hard to control my urges. And that moment when she cuddled me, it was the most peaceful I&#39;d felt in years. It brought an instant calm to my soul,tamed my beast and made me feel so safe around her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was still a mystery. How she took all the pain and torment away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now, I let her take my chains off &#39;cause I was sure I&#39;d be fine with her by my side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My limbs complained loudly as soon as the chains came off. She came closer to help me up -like l needed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like this,&#34; she said as she led me to the dining.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d have the appetite to eat before now,but knowing Lyric prepared this, I couldn&#39;t think of anything better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat quietly and started eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you like it?&#34; She studied my face for my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I simply gave a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite how helpful she&#39;d been, I still get sad that she was dragged into this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Lyric,&#34; I muttered a while later. &#34;You didn&#39;t have to be here.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m literally your mate.&#34; She rolled her eyes.&#34;What do you think my responsibility is?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed at the irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It might just be a contract, Jaris, but it&#39;s still my responsibility to care for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I smiled as I looked at her. &#34;You called my name.You remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tip of her nose turned pink. It always reminded me of Xylon whenever he giggled.</p>
