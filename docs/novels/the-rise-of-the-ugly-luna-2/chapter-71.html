                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two Days Later.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the most important day in our world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first of the three trials.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood before the mirror, staring at my bleak reflection. My hair and makeup looked perfect. Jaris had hired professionals to attend to me and ensure l looked my best.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, it was important I looked my best. I&#39;d be seated next to him as his Luna for everyone to see.He cared much for his reputation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the anticipation in the air, I couldn&#39;t help the feeling of unease that gnawed at my stomach. Just a while ago, while I bathed, I did that stupid uncomfortable thing again. I touched myself until l came, all to the memory of that weird dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never been able to make myself cum before. But this...it was beyond anything I could explain. Beyond the memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time the dream came to mind, it always felt real.It was as if I could feel him on me. Feel his kisses, his stimulating touch, his passion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was too real to ignore. To real not to cum.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And it bothered me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yesterday, I even opened up to Jace about it. Told him I&#39;d been having this disturbing dream and didn&#39;t know what it meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t of much help and simply teased me about being obsessed with Jaris who didn&#39;t like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt stuck. Confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone knocked, followed by my door opening.Only one person would knock and enter without waiting for my permission. &#34;See who&#39;s looking like a doll!&#34; Jace chuckled as he walked up to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was outfitted in a handsome suit, his hair freshly-shaved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flashed him a small smile before looking away.&#34;Hi,Jace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. Someone does not look happy. Tell me,cutie.What&#39;s making that pretty face sad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes, then turned around so my back was against the dresser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look good,&#34; I mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; he frowned as he looked down at the suit.&#34;I actually didn&#39;t wwant to come to this, but that dickhead, Kael insisted I do or I risk being kicked out of Darkspire. You know, that man might really go missing one day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laughed-genuinely this time. &#34;You two are crazy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He picked us the glass of wine I&#39;d been drinking and emptied it down his throat. &#34;You know, you&#39;d also become quite powerful when Jaris wins this thing.You&#39;d become the Luna to every other Luna.&#34; He chuckled, obviously liking how it tasted on his tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, you&#39;d have more people wanting to kiss your ass. You&#39;d be respected everywhere you go.Hm.My little friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike him who seemed pleased, my smile faded.The painful reality jabbed me in the chest, making me feel nothing but pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You seem to be forgetting it&#39;s only for a year,&#34; the words were acrid on my tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat and looked toward the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dawning on Jace, his countenance dropped as he ran his hand through his face. &#34;Fuck. Lyric, I&#39;m...I&#39;m sorry. I honestly don&#39;t know why I forgot.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta was going to be my replacement. Jaris only wanted me for a year before Marta took over. But why would he even want me for just a year? It didn&#39;t make much sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; | forced a smile at Jace. &#34;We should get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching downstairs, one of the guards was there to lead me to Jaris who had been waiting in his Stretch SUV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air seemed to shift as soon as I settled beside him. i took a deep breath, forcing the oxygen to remain in my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, Alpha.&#34; My voice lacked its usual warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was difficult to sound normal when I was hurting because of this very man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were both in the backseat, yet felt so far due to the distance between us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris looked stunning. I could tell from the brief glance I took at him. He also smelt good, of rich cologne. It was the very one I smelt in my dream.And that, on its own, was a torment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Lyric,&#34; he murmured without looking at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a minute, we hit the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The trial was taking place in a much bigger hall. It was packed to the brim as the pack members of each participating Alpha were present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not everyone, though. Otherwise, there wouldn&#39;t be enough space for people to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I were led in through the back entrance and onto the main stage where the participating Alphas and their Lunas sat. I did not miss the dissatisfied look that filled the faces of the other Alphas as soon as they saw Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They must be intimidated by his participation.Well,even I would&#39;ve felt the same way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris&#39; expression was as hard as rock as we were ledto take our seats. I found myself being a little nervous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I might have our differences. He might be an ass and hurt my feelings most of the times, but l still wanted him to win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall was a little noisy as guests made their way in and tried to settle in. I used the distraction to stare at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Man was undoubtedly handsome. Charming. He was the cutest male I&#39;d ever seen, despite how rude he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind drifted to five years ago, on that magical night when he called me a name I&#39;d never been called before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Your wish is my command, Princess.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Until tonight, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever met a lady as stunning as you, Princess.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breath froze in my throat. Those were the cutest things anyone had ever said to me. Even after so long, they sounded so clear in my head like they&#39;d only been said yesterday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;Do you think we could adjust our deal? I&#39;d love to spend another day with you.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More of his magical words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled, dragging my eyes to my nails. I really needed to stop thinking about him if I didn&#39;t want to risk ruining my makeup and gaining people&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt better when the chairman-Jace&#39;s father-came up and addressed the people. It was a welcomed distraction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall became quiet. Some peace, finally.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He welcomed everyone, including the Alphas and their Lunas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, he spoke about the first trial which he said was termed &#39;A King&#39;s Wisdom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A large screen on the wall came on. There, we could see various rooms sliding past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman explained what the rooms meant. The participating Alphas would be in it, each at a time.They were to escape the rooms within a given time.And we, the viewers, would be able to see all the decisions they make and the actions they take.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ve heard a lot about how tricky the trails could be.It was the first time I&#39;d be getting to watch it.I considered it a privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The participating Alphas were summoned. My eyes caught onto Roderick, only because he&#39;d been staring at me. I hadn&#39;t even noticed he was present as I had been too busy stealing glances at Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, Roderick Fletcher wouldn&#39;t miss this opportunity for anything in the world. Someone that thrived on power.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alpha Zarek was there as well. That familiar feeling of unease wrapped around me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#39;t help the feeling that he was hiding something from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman addressed the Alphas, giving them the simple rules of the trial. Firstly, they were forbidden from using their powers in any form.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He told them, &#34;this is a trail for the wisest minds.It is to see how right you think.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, he conveyed, &#34;At this moment, you&#39;re to see yourselves as the Alpha King. Think as one. Act like one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wished them luck, and off they were. They were led away by some guards who took them through a narrow path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sucked in a deep breath as I rubbed my palms together. Some of them would fail this trial. I knew it.Not all could pass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, I hoped Jaris would be among the winners.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the stage now were the Lunas of the Alphas. We sat back and waited for the first Alphas to perform.</p>
