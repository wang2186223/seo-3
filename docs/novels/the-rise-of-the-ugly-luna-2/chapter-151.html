                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hand in my pocket fisted, wishing I could punch himn in the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m only giving you a week, Jaris. Reach out to the Elders and the people of our Pack, and tell them you&#39;re stepping down from your position and handing over to me. Do this, and we won&#39;t have any problems. But if you don&#39;t, I can promise you, there would be chaos.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked back to him, maintaining a steady pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden, I think we both know why you&#39;re still alive. Eight years ago, I could&#39;ve easily killed you rather than imprison you. But | didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m sure you know why.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a knowing glint in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We made a vow never to kill each other,&#34; he replied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after we discovered what we were. That we were special and the only ones that could kill the other. It was our own way of protecting us against the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good.&#34; I gave a clipped nod. &#34;But read my lips. I&#39;ll not hesitate to break that pact if you come for anyone of mine again. I&#39;ll make you pay, Caden, so dearly you&#39;d wish I&#39;d killed you eight years ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His expression gave nothing away. But I knew the words had sunk in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite my threat to Caden, I was still restless. I knew the bastard. He was just like me and wouldn&#39;t back down easily. I&#39;d have to find a way to handle him like I did the last time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the two hours drive back to Darkspire, I was totally restless and needed something to calm me down. In all of this, there was only one person I could think of that could help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s only been a few hours, yet I already missed her like she held the oxygen for my lungs. I wanted to see her face, despite how bruised it was at the moment. It didn&#39;t mean a thing to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Has she been okay since I was away? Had the doctors checked on her again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking out my phone, I called the Pack doctor and was relieved when she told me they just checked on her for the second time today.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept looking through the window until finally, we reached the Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t waste any time. I headed straight to my room. It was a relief watching her sleep in my bed. If only it was possible, I&#39;d have made it happen a lot sooner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quite unfortunate that Lyric and I had always been at loggerheads. Hopefully, this time, the friendship between us would last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever I&#39;d been feeling for her months ago was getting stronger. It had gone beyond the lust. It was harder being away from her.Harder not hearing her voice and her cute laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t understand why this woman had this effect on me. No one ever did. It was frustrating because in ten months, we&#39;ll be forced to go our separate ways. But how was that supposed to happen with all these unexplainable things I felt around her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching my room and expecting to find her in my bed, I was met with a huge disappointment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bed was empty. I instantly knew she wasn&#39;t just in the bathroom or something. She was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A strange feeling of disappointment tugged at my heart. What the hell was this feeling?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around, going in a different direction. In a minute, I was in front of her door. I knocked and my suspicions were confirmed when her faint voice came from inside. I was right. She left me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why did she leave my room? Wasn&#39;t she comfortable? Was there a problem she didn  talk about? I opened the door and found her lying in bed, her face still seeming pale. She looked exhausted. Was she still in pain?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,&#34; she smiled faintly. &#34;You&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her present condition, it made me wish I&#39;d done more than just killing Caden&#39;s men. I should&#39;ve bruised the bastard as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How&#39;re you feeling?&#34; I remained calm despite the raging thoughts in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Better than I was this morning,&#34; she chuckled and winced right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it; she was still in pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You moved. You missed your room,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t smile. &#34;I-I just thought you needed the space. I mean, you&#39;ve done enough taking care of me last night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silly girl. What in the world gave her the impression that I needed space when she was all I wanted to see?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see. You should get some rest, then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room, feeling angry at her for making stupid decisions for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that disappointment I&#39;d seen in Jaris&#39; face?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.I was definitely mistáken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after he left, Jace&#39;s call came into my phone. I eagerly answered, hoping he had some information on Penelope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s missing, Lyric. Even her husband has been looking for her,&#34; Jace&#39;s reply stunned me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That means she was really in danger that night. Who might&#39;ve been chasing her? Wh-What if they killed her?&#34; My brows were creased with worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But we can&#39;t be too sure, Jace! Remember I told you I heard gunshots before the line went dead.What if...what if someone really killed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why would they kill her when she was on the verge of revealing the truth to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That I didn&#39;t know. If her life was in danger, how was revealing the truth to me the only thing on her mind?She wasn&#39;t even calling for help or anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need her, Jace,&#34;Ipinched my brows. &#34;She&#39;s the only one with answers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I could find my kids, I&#39;d be long gone from here. But I couldn&#39;t leave without them.</p>
