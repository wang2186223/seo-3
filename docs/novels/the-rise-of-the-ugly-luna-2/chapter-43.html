                <p>A heavy lump formed in my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just forward the footage to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Thank you.So much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call ended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled nervously.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I was hurting, I couldn&#39;t shake off the feeling that something might&#39;ve happened to me that night.Something I did not remember.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I eagerly waited for the footage, but the manager appeared to be slow, and until I reached my destination,the footage did not come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stared at the tall building in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. Was I making the right decision?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grabbing my bag and file, I stepped out of the car, into TCH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The place was bright and busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Large,glass windows lined one wall, allowing natural light to flood the space. Colorful artwork adorned the walls, providing small bursts of warmth amid the clinical atmosphere.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reception desk buzzed with activity as calls were answered and visitors were directed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sitting in the reception, I put a call through to the woman I was supposed to meet. I told her I was there, and in a few minutes, she joined me. When I told father about my plan, he gave me her contact, saying she was an old friend and would link me up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, ma&#39;am.&#34; I greeted her as I stood with my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, dear. How&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She accessed me. &#34;The name is Helen. Congratulations, on becoming the Luna of Darkspire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit my lip as I lowered my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What I should be getting was sympathy, not congrats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She led into the elevator where we went up to the fourth floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Your father tells me you&#39;re quite good at what you do&#34; Helen said as we walked down the corridor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. And I love helping people.&#34; I was a little distracted by the glimpse of sick people I saw through the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, I believe you&#39;ll be of great help here.&#34; We stopped in front of a door. &#34;She is the head of this department. I already told her you were coming and put in a good word for you. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get this.&#34; She winked at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knocking once on the door, she&#39; opened the door to a familiar face behind the desk. I froze for a moment as l locked eyes with Marta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? She was the head of this department?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello,Marta. She&#39;s the lady I told you about,&#34; Helen introduced, stepping into the room ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Marta seemed surprised. Then displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing my legs to move, I made my way into the office, my fingers fiddling with the strap of my bag.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helen winked at me and left. &#34;Lyric.&#34; Marta&#39;s voice held no warmth. &#34;Take a seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at her, a bitter memory from that night resurfaced, reopening healing wounds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Four nights ago, on the night Jaris and I had mated, I hadI been heading to his room to see if I could get an answer from him. Then, I found Marta leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a red revealing dress, trying to straighten her ruffled hair. I didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me those lips had been kissed. And when saw me, she had worn a triumphant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond wounded. I couldn&#39;t believe that Jaris had slept with her on a night like that. I understood that we were not supposed to have any form of romance, but how could he disrespect our bond like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You want to work here?&#34; Marta asked, pulling me out of my painful trance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed the lump in my throat, forcing my composure on. &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I scoffed. &#34;What do you mean &#39;why?&#39; Why do doctors work here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned rigid. &#34;I am interviewing you, Lyric. So, I&#39;d suggest you watch your words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. I suppressed the urge to roll my eyes. &#34;I want to work here because I want to help people, as much as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze lingered on me before she lowered them to my file. She frowned. &#34;You haven&#39;t worked in a hospital before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question made me a little edgy. &#34;Um....I have. I just... I didn&#39;t get to have it on my resume.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s that? Were you kicked out or what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t give an answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where was this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, no. I couldn&#39;t answer that. Nobody could ever know where it was or what I had done there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t answer that.&#34; I lowered my eyes to my legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t need to look up at her to know she was displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I guess I&#39;m also sorry,&#34; she closed my file, sliding it to me. &#34;But we don&#39;t accept amateurs here in TCh.So,I can&#39;t accept you.&#34;</p>
