                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. I lost it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The last thread of my control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My breathing got uneven as I tried and failed to suppress my tears. One came running effortlessly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Executioner turned fully to face me, wearing a smile. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she was amused by my tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So, what&#39;s it going to be, Lyric?&#34; She walked back to me. &#34;Are you going to tell me what you know? Or should I go ahead and inform my colleagues?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither of the options was better. There was no way l was letting her leave when she already had her suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Amidst my fear and tears, something struck me.Her colleagues didn&#39;t know | existed. So, if she didn&#39;t report to them, they&#39;d be entirely clueless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped with a flutter of nerves. What if... what if l could Siphon her memories? She wouldn&#39;t remember seeing me and won&#39;t be able to expose me to the others. It&#39;ll give me enough time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, it&#39;d be a shame to do this the wrong way...&#34;She went on talking while I zoned out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I observed our proximity. She was close enough for my hand to wrap around hers. Based on the research I&#39;d been making, I should be able to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart was beating worse than it had been moments ago. It was thumping so hard against my ribcage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Think, Lyric. Think.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bit the inside of my cheeks, my eyes zeroing in on her lips as they moved, her neck, and down to the hand I needed to hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay, then,&#34; she shrugged with finality. &#34;Let&#39;s do this your way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned away from me,heading for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| stopped thinking and acted. My hand shot out,grabbing her strong one. It was so cold in my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whipped around at me, but before she could react, I dug my nails into the skin of her wrist and focused like the research said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She winced immediately, but the effect must have taken place on her as she couldn&#39;t seem to fight me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wow.Seeing someone as strong as she was grunting this way in pain didn&#39;t seem real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t exactly know if I was doing it right, but | felt the energy leaving her hand and going into mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was clearly working. She kept grunting in pain and couldn&#39;t fight back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees buckled until they gave out, hitting the floor. In that moment, seeing her on her knees in front of me, it gave me a kind of thrill. The Executioners were deadly people. Yet, before me,this very one was defenseless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me feel powerful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I was lost in the thrill of it, not even hearing the lady&#39;s painful grunts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept going and going, not knowing when to stop.Until she passed out in front of mne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released her wrist as I stepped back with a gasp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My emotions and reasoning clicked into place. My lips shook and I had it bitedown on it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Was she supposed to pass out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took in her form. The place where my nails dug into was there, little drops of blood all over the wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what bothered me the most was the paleness of her face. Was it normal to look that way after losing your memories? How was I even sure the process worked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a hard gulp, looking around like there was someone else in the bathroom with me. Of course,there wasn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to steady my own breathing as I checked her respiratory rate. Dread settled low in my stomach when I couldn&#39;t see anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Just calm down, Lyric and check properly.She must definitely have a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dropping to my knees, I took her blood-free hand and checked her pulse. Mine beat louder, contrasting the quietness I felt in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two fingers I placed on her wrist were starting to shake so terribly. I couldn&#39;t... I couldn&#39;t feel a pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,&#34; I muttered to myself, shaking my head. &#34;No...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took her bloodied wrist to check but got the same result. No pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the hand so quickly like it burned, my own pulse running too fast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She couldn&#39;t be... she couldn&#39;t be dead. It couldn&#39;t have killed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, wake up,&#34; I gently touched her head, afraid I&#39;d break her further if I touched her roughly. &#34;Please.Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear tasted like acid on my tongue. It burnt the back of my throat, forcing me to scratch it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lids grew heavy with sweat as reality slowly began to settle in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I just killed someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to Siphon her memories and ended up killing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rose to my feet on shaky legs, unable to think clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, when I heard a sound just outside the door,it helped me with a little reasoning. A new sense of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened as I listened to the running footsteps. No!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran out of the restroom, my eyes darting down the passage, but I couldn&#39;t see anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran farther, going out to the main exit. Still nothing.Whoever it was, they were gone. They saw me, and now they were gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My throat grew thick. I noticed too late that I wanted to retch and ended up throwing up on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I bent in half, my hands over my knees for support.Tears spilled down my cheeks as I threw up everything I had from the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do I do? What do I do?&#34; I repeated in a whimper, itching my scalp with both hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a corpse in the bathroom. Someone had seen or heard us and I didn&#39;t even know who it was.And here I was, ruining the floor with my vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do this. I ran out the door, ignoring the field and heading straight to the main house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as I was in the confines of my room, I pulled at my hair and screamed. I screamed so hard my lungs hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing everyone was at the field and there was no one to hear me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The terror of everything that just happened.weighed heavily on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I killed an Executioner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was never my intention. I only wanted to erase her memories. I thought I could. How did she end up dead?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.How do l dispose of the body? Who was it that heard us?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was doomed. Finally, I was doomed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I needed help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of calling Jace but quickly decided against it. Jace would be mad at me and might not want to help me. He warned me not to make the research.Maybe I should&#39;ve listened. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t have killed someone tonight. Now that she was dead, her people would definitely come to know what happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t have a choice!&#34; | cried out, like there was someone in the room to hear me. &#34;She&#39;d have exposed me. She&#39;d have exposed me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I crashed on the floor, weeping profusely</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I was so so scared. Maybe it was time to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. I needed to take care of the body first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But how do I dispose of the body when there was a party taking place in the field?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But it was in the restroom. Anyone could walk in on it and freak out. The party would have to come to an end.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods; the kids had waited so long for this day and I was just about to ruin it with someone&#39;s death. How would they feel knowing that someone died on their sixth birthday? Right in their party?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t do this to them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wiped my face, arranged my hair and left the room.My breathing was a little too loud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could take the body elsewhere, keep it hidden until the party was over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could-</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My thoughts came to a halt as did my feet whenl noticed a gathering around the guest house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No no no.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, don&#39;t tell me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I swallowed hard as I hastened my steps, my stomach churning like it was about to release more vomit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way through the mumbling crowd and into the house. My puke was still there at the entrance,feeling me with revulsion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that wasn&#39;t even the worst part. It was my fear being confirmed as I noticed the gathering extending to the restroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They&#39;d seen the body.</p>
