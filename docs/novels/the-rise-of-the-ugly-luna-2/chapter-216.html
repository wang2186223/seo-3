                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! Can you stop being a dumbass? Now&#39;s not the time.&#34; Jace shoved him on the chest. &#34;Just so you know, I just don&#39;t trust her because she&#39;s my bestfriend. I trust her because I know who she is and know she&#39;ll never lie to me so blatantly. If she said she didn&#39;t do it, then of course, I believe her. And if you were in love with me, you&#39;d believe me too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pressing silence filled the air as the two men continued to stare at each other in heated gazes.Until slowly, their rage began to dissipate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric is a good woman,&#34; Kael shook his head. &#34;I know. Okay? I actually like and respect her. But it&#39;s hard to believe when she&#39;s the only Siphon we&#39;ve had, plus she had a good reason to kill the Luna.Either way, I don&#39;t know how I can help, Jace. I swore my loyalty to the King. Breaking Lyric out would be a blatant betrayal. I can&#39;t do that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointment clouded Jace&#39;s features. &#34;Really?You won&#39;t do it even for me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, come on. Don&#39;t try to make this about us. You know I&#39;d love to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t know nothing!&#34; Hle rasped, taking some steps back. &#34;Yet, you dare to wonder why I&#39;m so attached to Lyrc? It&#39;s because she understands the concept of love. If the roles were reversed, Lyric would&#39;ve done anything for me. Too bad my best friend is more loving than the man I thought I was in love with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey! You don&#39;t get to say that! Do you hear me? You know I&#39;d have done anything for you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jace didn&#39;t look at him as he continued goinig to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace, come on. We need to talk. Jace-&#34; Jace&#39;s only response was the door opening and slamming shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later in the day, he was in the garden, smoking quietly when Kael came. He simply glanced at him before looking away, taking a long drag from his cigar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a brief silence between them until Kael threw a key at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the spare key to her cell. I&#39;ll try to distract the guards when it&#39;s time so you can get her out. I&#39;ll also give you a map that&#39;ll lead you to the secret exits so you don&#39;t get seen by people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace felt a surge of warmth in his heart as he picked up the key from the floor, then looked at Kael with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t ever get to say such trash to me-ever again, Jace,&#34; Kael cut him off. &#34;I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m perfect, but that doesn&#39;t mean you get to make me feel less of myself. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Yes. I&#39;m so sorry. I swear, I was just mad and didn&#39;t mean what I said.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t care if you meant it or not. Just let this sink in.&#34; He meandered into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unlike every other night when I&#39;d been able to deal with my conscience, tonight was different and more complicated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was restless and couldn&#39;t stop pacing my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone was waiting for my judgement, and unfailingly tomorrow, I&#39;d have to give it to them.I always thought I&#39;d be the kind of King who would have everything under control no matter the situation. Never did I think a situation would arise that would involve my mother being killed by my mate. It was unbearable. I needed to see Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to control the urge any further, I left my room.The guards stationed at my door followed me immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My King, where are you headed?&#34; One of them asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To the cell.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know what I&#39;d say to her.For a week, I&#39;d been avoiding &#39;cause I wasn&#39;t sure how l&#39;d handle this moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, however, I couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. I didn&#39;t know what tomorrow would bring. So,we needed to have this talk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My steps faltered when I reached the cell and found the guards out on the floor. The guards with me rushed forward to check them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instantly, it dawned on me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hastened my steps to the cell where she was being held even though I knew it was toolate. As expected,the cell was open and empty. She was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my arms wrapped around me as Jace drove at a crazy speed. I couldn&#39;t stop looking in the rearview,afraid that someone might be after us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We escaped a while ago and have already left the Capital City, but what if they&#39;ve found my cell and there were people after us? It&#39;d be worse if I got caught.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here,&#34; I said again, sniffling.&#34;You&#39;re putting yourself in danger. I told you,I can drive out myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really think you can survive being a fugitive on your own?&#34; He snorted. &#34;Trust me, you need me,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t need to drag you into my mess.&#34; I sniffled again. &#34;For how long will you need to protect me? What about Kael? I-I mean, he helped you and you&#39;re just gonna abandon him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He said nothing. I turned to look at him as I wiped a tear from my face. &#34;You didn&#39;t tell him you were going with me, did you? He&#39;s probably back there,expecting you to come back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he remained silent and focused on the road,I got my answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t do this, Jace. It&#39;s bad enough that I ruined my life. I don&#39;t want to ruin anybody&#39;s.&#34; More tears rolled down my cheeks. They wouldn&#39;t stop running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Just stop, Lyric. We both know you&#39;re not upset about me and Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I broke into more tears as the pain became unbearable. My hands shielded my mouth in a vain effort to silence my weeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t get to see him. For over a week I was there and he didn&#39;t even come visiting. He didn&#39;t care about the fact that I lost our baby.&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t be like that, lyric. You know things were messed up for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, things were messed up for me too! I could&#39;ve lost my life while I was being abused by the Luna.Besides, couldn&#39;t he have heard my own side of the story?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned my head against the window as I wept some more. &#34;I just miss him, you know? That night, we&#39;d just showered together. I was-l was supposed to go get a change of clothes from my room, then go back to his for a sleepover before the Luna attacked me.She ruined everyone. She ruined my life!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s hand reached out to hold my hand, giving it a tight squeeze.&#34;Everything will be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It won&#39;t! Not when Jaris isn&#39;t here. Not when I lost my baby! Not when everything&#39;s so hopeless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dug my hands into my hair, pulling at my roots.Gods, I wished things were different. I wished Jaris was here right now and I didn&#39;t have to be in this car going away from him.</p>
