                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes grew large, shining as brightly as the sun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My world came spinning, crashing down and building up again just to crash even more painfully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All this happened in seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I opened my mouth to speak, but no words formed. I couldn&#39;t get my head straight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Siphon,&#34; he repeated, crystal clear this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; I tried to swallow, but the ball of nerves was too much in my throat. I couldn&#39;t gulp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I inhaled deeply and tried again. &#34;I&#39;ll get someone to check on you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I tried to run that I realized he was still holding my hand. Now that he was awake, the man was strong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I panicked, my eyes darting to the door and back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go.&#34; It was a plea. &#34;Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally did, his eyes growing soft.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He breathed deeply, closing his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Siphon,&#34; he repeated, even as it seemed like he was going back to sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t wait around to hear more. I sprinted out of the room, my heart pounding against my ribs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop until I was in the nearest restroom and shut the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pulled at the root of my shirt, pacing the small room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew what I was. But how... How could he easily tell? Did I make a mistake saving him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was right. I shouldn&#39;t have cared about saving anyone. I should&#39;ve kept it hidden like I planned. I spent a long time in the restroom, too scared to go out. What if he was already screaming my secret to everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on my door startled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Use the other rooms!&#34; I shouted in frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze. Geez, it was Marta. What did she want?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes rounded. Oh, no. What if she knows?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quickly opened the door, eager to know if my life was doomed or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She regarded me coldly, like I was dirt in her way.&#34;You&#39;ve been there for too long. What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. It didn&#39;t seem like she knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath to calm my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you monitoring me?&#34; I frowned. Did she see me run out of the man&#39;s room? Please tell me she didn&#39;t.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Anyway, you can be dying for all I care. I came here to pass an important information across.&#34; She crossed her arms over her chest, and there she was-the bitchy Marta I knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like a mean doctor in her lab coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tell your friend to steer clear from me. I don&#39;t know what his problem is, and I really don&#39;t care. Just tell him not to rub it off on me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind drifted to the issue she had with Jace. Oh,right. She was in a shitty position right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you have an issue with Jace, you should settle it with him. What does that have to do with me?&#34;I frowned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression turned into something else. Her eyes became darker, like a serpent about to spit out venom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand, do you?&#34; Her voice was dangerously low. &#34;You don&#39;t understand the implications,do you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was a different side of Marta. I&#39;d never seen her this vile before her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could brace myself for what to do next, she slapped me hard across the face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head reeled to the side, a gasp slipping past my throat as I put a hand over my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was beyond shocked. Marta slapped me!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes were as wide and burning as that of a mad woman. Who would&#39;ve thought that the issue with the kids would be enough to make Marta lose her mind?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll ruin you, Lyric.&#34; She pointed an angry finger at me. &#34;You and your worthless friend. I&#39;ll take you both to the ground and bury you so deep if you don&#39;t stay away from me and my family. My kids are my family,and I&#39;ll never let you jeopardize that. Let it sink!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before I could think better of it, my hands flew to her hair, roughly pulling at her roots. But despite the rage in my chest, I was still held back by the fact that this was a professional ground. We shouldn&#39;t be doing this here. Marta, however, didn&#39;t seem to care, and she used how reluctant my hold was to push me off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t ever lay your filthy hands on me,&#34; she snarled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Same goes for you, Marta!&#34; I half-yelleld. &#34;This should be the first and last time you ever think of hitting me. What do you think I am, stupid? If we weren&#39;t in TCH right now, I promise, you&#39;d have been on the floor by now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,spare me,&#34; she snorted. &#34;This is only a little warning. You can be sure to expect more if you and your asshole of a friend don&#39;t stay away from my business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to leave, but I grabbed her hand,bringing her back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let her see the seriousness in my eyes when I spoke to her. &#34;Like I said, if you have an issue with Jace, go settle it with him. Don&#39;t expect me to keep quiet when he&#39;s trying to uncover an important truth.&#34; I tilted my head to the side. &#34;Or isn&#39;t that the truth,Marta? Do you think he&#39;s lying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes turned to icicles. But I couldn&#39;t care less.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I released her wrist and walked away, still hating the fact that she had the nerves to slap me and I wasn&#39;t able to do much about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was at the office, reviewing some files with my CMO when Kael walked in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His presence was thrilling and enough to make me dismiss the CMO in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I believe you have the package?&#34; I asked eagerly as he came to take the seat the CMO had just been spitting on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me that reluctant look before slipping his hand into his pocket and returning with a small pack of pills.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dropped it on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Went through a lot of trouble to get this. You know it&#39;s forbidden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt a cold sensation as I picked up the pack,observing the pack like it was a pack of gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If it was truly forbidden, it&#39;d stop being produced,&#34; I muttered without looking at him. &#34;What about the second stuff?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, he sighed, as if being reluctant with his answer. &#34;It&#39;s in the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded, satisfaction brimming inside me. &#34;Go get the car ready, then. We&#39;re heading home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood up and was about to open the door when he paused and looked at me. &#34;You know you don&#39;t have to do this, right? It&#39;s not exactly... noble.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was almost tempted to roll my eyes, bored with the conversation. &#34;When have I ever been noble? You must be confusing my status for nobility.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, J. You know what I&#39;m talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t even want to know. Now,get going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael wasn&#39;t a nice man. He&#39;d done a lot of pretty bad things in his life. Yet, here he was, counselling me like some grandfather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laughable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Using my landline, I called my assistant to come to the office. In seconds, she was there. I asked her to pack up my things and follow me to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as we reached Darkspire, I took the things from Kael and went into Lyric&#39;s room. Of course, I&#39;d have a spare key with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me an hour to set up the first stuff, then droppeda single pill and a note on her dresser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood with my hands in my pockets, staring at the pill. I tried. The Moon knows I tried for it not to come to this. Kael was right. This was wrong. But I couldn&#39;t bring myself to care anymore. I&#39;ve never been a good man. No. I&#39;ve done a lot of bad things that doesn&#39;t give me the privilegeto be called good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>You could say I&#39;m a good leader, but not a good man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And maybe, Lyric deserved this for messing with my head.</p>
