                <p>The spoon dropped from my hand as I picked up my phone and called him. My heart thumped at lightning speed, threatening to leap right out of my ribcage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully,Jace answered when I called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I saww your text. Is it true? She&#39;s alive?&#34; I rushed the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. But her sister isn&#39;t letting me speak with her yet.I just think you should get down here. Maybe if she sees you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Okay. I-I&#39;ll be there. Just give me some time.Is it at her sister&#39;s place?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Hurry,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was confused for a minute. Getting to that location would take me about five hours. It&#39;d be midnight by the time I get back here. Would Jaris be fine without me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt scared leaving him alone, but I had to put my kids first.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went into the guestroom and looked through the drawers for a short. I found a black one which I  was sure belonged to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I replaced the boxer I had on with it and was brushing my hair in front of the mirror when he showed up at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Going somewhere?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was out of words for a moment. I was actually going out to look for &#39;our&#39; kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.I just need to meet up with someone real quick.&#34;I grabbed a ribbon to park my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And you had no intentions of telling me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course, I did! I-I was just about to come tell you as soon as I was done dressing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t look satisfied. &#34;Where are you going? We should go together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why? Are you going to see another male?&#34; There was a colder edge to his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; My brows creased in confusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes suddenly grew soft. He battened down the shutters of his eyes, let his head float back, and released a long breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with me. You should go.&#34;He walked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood still for a moment, replaying what had just happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I finished with my hair, grabbed my car keys and went out to meet him in the living room. He was just on the couch,staring into space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-You could come with me. But please, promise me you&#39;ll stay in the car when we get there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes were cold as they pinned me with a stare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A lot could actually go wrong here. What if he suddenly becomes blood-hungry and hurts me or someone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; he muttered, rising to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Walking to the door, he grabbed the keys from my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mood got better between Jaris and I when we hit the road. Looked like he only wanted to be around me -which was cool but unusual. I was devastated when he told me Caden had hacked into my phone which was how he got to know about the diner. I felt so stupid for not thinking about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then, it wasn&#39;t something that was common.The guy was just a psychopath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I put a mental note to get a new phone tomorrow.Thank goodness Jace and I hadn&#39;t shared any texts concerning our location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After five excruciating hours, we reached the location.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still won&#39;t tell me who&#39;s in there?&#34; Jaris asked,staring out the window,at the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s just someone I need to ask some questions. I&#39;ll be quick, don&#39;t worry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the car and went out to meet with Jace who also came out of his own car when he saw me. I already told Jaris Jace and I were visiting someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we walked toward the house, I kept glancing back at Jaris.I really hoped he&#39;d keep to his promise and stay in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We knocked severally on the door until Cora opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why the hell won&#39;t you leave me alone?! Do I have to</p>
                
                
                
                <p>involve security?&#34; She rasped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Cora, please,&#34; Jace pleaded. &#34;I already told you we&#39;re not dangerous. My friend and I only have a question for your sister. I know she was the one I saw through the window. You know it too.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine! You already proved you&#39;re not dangerous. Still,I told you my sister can&#39;t help you. Why won&#39;t you just listen and back off?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because we can&#39;t back off!&#34; I stepped in, my heart teeming with wrath. &#34;It isn&#39;t that easy, you know?Considering the kind of information I need from her.Not to mean any disrespect, Cora,but if you don&#39;t let us in, we might have to break in ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face paled. &#34;How can you tell me-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard us right,&#34; Jace cut in. &#34;It&#39;s really that important we talk to your sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally- something that now seemed unbelievable-she let us into the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope hasn&#39;t been the same,&#34; she told us as she led us toward a bedroom. &#34;I really don&#39;t know if she&#39;d be able to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the room, and I wanted to scream in relief when I found Penelope standing by the window,her hand nervously rubbing her arms. &#34;You let them in?!&#34; She squealed. &#34;What if they&#39;re here to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, Penelope. They&#39;re good people,&#34; Cora interrupted her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as Penelope took a hard gulp, still regarding us with suspicious eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something seemed off about her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been looking for you,&#34; I began. &#34;You called me that night but we didn&#39;t get to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tenth July. You called and was saying something about-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t remember anything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart stopped beating in my chest. Okay. I must&#39;ve misheard her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Penelope-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t even know who you are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;re you talking about?! It&#39;s me, Lyric! You were going to tell me about my kids. How can you say you don&#39;t remember?!&#34;</p>
