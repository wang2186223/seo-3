                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the hell is your problem?&#34; I snapped at her.&#34;Why are you so bothered by me? I mean, I&#39;m not the reason you work here as his assistant instead of being the mate you clearly wish you were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glowered at me and opened her mouth to say something, but I held my finger up, halting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll just call your boss to come get me himself.&#34; I retrieved my phone from my bag,trying al I could to stop my fingers from quaking from rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Like he&#39;d care,&#34; she huffed. &#34;I&#39;m sure Alpha Jaris would ask you to leave when he learns you&#39;re here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>l ignored her as I made the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a good thing the rest of the staff were not in the same space with us to hear the exchange. It&#39;d be beyond embarrassing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Jaris picked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi, Jaris. Would you mind stepping out of your office, please? I&#39;m right here, but your bittered assistant wouldn&#39;t let me in.&#34; I kept my eyes on the said lady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris hesitated. Hle must be shocked that I was there and surprised that I addressed him by his name alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I was desperate to prove to the lady that I had some sort of relationship with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed her confidence slip when the door opened behind her. She rose to her feet immediately, turning around to face Jaris who was already stepping out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His astonished eyes locked onto mine, soaking in my every nuance with curiosity. &#34;Lyric?&#34; He furrowed his brows, like he wasn&#39;t sure l was actually standing in front of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was still wearing the turtleneck. While he looked every bit of the Jaris we all knew, I couldn&#39;t help but notice he appeared more bossy. Something that had to do with him being the king of the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hi.&#34; I smiled at him before glaring at the assistant who appeared really stunned. What was she thinking? That Jaris would really throw me out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You didn&#39;t tell me you were coming,&#34; he broke the brief silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was hoping I&#39;d surprise you. But in the meantime,could you lecture your assistant on how to deal with people? She was very rude to me. Very very rude.&#34;I glared harder at her. &#34;As a matter of fact, she threatened to throw me out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The lady looked like she had swallowed a ball of acid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;l-l- actually, sir, I w-was only trying to know if she had an appointment.&#34; Jaris nodded. &#34;I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t know who you were.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, she did. And she told me to my face that she didn&#39;t care. She even told me there was nothing special about me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, this brought out a different reaction in Jaris. His face grew stiffened, his silver eyes holding surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyway, I was done with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I started toward him so we could go into his office,but he didn&#39;t even look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you do that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stopped, realizing he was talking to the assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m-I&#39;m sorry, sir. It wasn&#39;t what I meant. I just-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get Joyce to replace you. I don&#39;t want you here the next time I come out.&#34; He turned around, reaching for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Sir, please! I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s not what you think!&#34;The lady ran toward him, but he was already in his office, closing the door behind him. She must know she wasn&#39;t supposed to go into his office because she didn&#39;t try to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My jaw dropped in disbelief. Was he... firing her?That wasn&#39;t even my intention when I told him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face covered with tears, she turned tò me.&#34;Please! Please, I&#39;m so sorry. Help me talk to him.Please,I beg you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was whimpering like. a child. I couldn&#39;t believe this was the same girl that had been so sharp-mouthed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know what to say to her and just went into the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was instantly struck by the beauty of the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering bookshelves lined the walls, with panoramic windows that bathed the room in warm golden light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was really a king wherever he controlled. He was already in his seat, going through some files,his muscles tense. Was he angry?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to fire her.&#34; I kept my voice low and soft. &#34;I know she was kind of rude but, I didn&#39;t mean for her to get hurt when I told you. I thought you were only going to scold her or something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t tell me how to treat my staff, Lyric. Take a seat if you&#39;re here to see me,&#34; he snapped, his words like iced daggers, making me flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why was he so short-tempered?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if sensing he was harsh, he took a deep breath as he looked up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why are you here?&#34; He sounded more relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;| was...bored.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lifted a brow skeptically, making it evident he found the situation laughable. &#34;Really, Lyric? You came here to see me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were settled on his turtleneck, wishing| could see what was beneath it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are a million other things you could&#39;ve done if you were really bored,&#34; Jaris said, dragging me out of my imaginary strip attempt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea clicked in my head. It was a crazy one and l didn&#39;t think I could do it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why can&#39;t seeing you be one of those things?&#34;|found myself moving forward,anyway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes trained on me as I kept going forward,rounded his table until I was only inches away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was stupid. Jaris might yell at me right now and call me names, and I&#39;ll get hurt and cry. Did | really want to take the risk?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I was desperate and didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to stand behind him. He cocked his head but didn&#39;t fully look at me. &#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to say something, but my tongue wasn&#39;t as brave as my limbs. My fingers shook lightly from what I was about to do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34; He called when I remained silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I laid my hands on his shoulders, treating him to an affectionate, soft massage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I noticed him go rigid. My insides screamed in both joy and protest. It was the first time | was consciously touching him like this, and while I was so nervous, I couldn&#39;t deny that he felt so right in my hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must be tired.&#34; My tone was light. &#34;This should help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What followed was a silence steeped in nervous tension. But I found it astonishing that he still hadn&#39;t asked me to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gulped dryly as I went on with the process. After a while, I did what I had to. I slightly pulled the neck of his shirt, revealing the skin behind it.</p>
