                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monster gave me a location and warned me not to tell anyone about it. It&#39;s not like I was planning to.The last thing I wanted to do was distract Jaris from what he had to do tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got rid of the tears on my face with makeup and was just about to head out when Jaris came in again. He was fully dressed this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You ready?&#34; There was hardly any mirth in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gone was the playful Jaris. This was the cold Alpha that had serious business to attend to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; My eyes dropped to the floor. &#34;I&#39;m sorry,but could I catch up with you later?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked him brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just...having these cramps.I think I need to take some drugs and rest for a while.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t hide the displeasure from his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isn&#39;t there a way you could rest during the flight there?&#34; &#34;No, I&#39;m sorry. I think it&#39;ll get worse if I move around as soon as I take the drugs. Remember you&#39;re going earlier right? I&#39;ll be there before the trial starts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He still seemed reluctant to leave. &#34;I was...hoping we&#39;d fly together. Wanted us to talk about something.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I saw it again-the flicker of sadness in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But as quickly as it came, it was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll just see you later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I slammed my hands against the table as soon as he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, damn Caden. Damn him and everything he&#39;s ever loved. This was supposed to be perfect for Jaris and I.I should be with him, encouraging and talking about the trial with him. This was never the plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was sure he must&#39;ve gone, I picked up my bag and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told Mrs. Bastina to remain calm and that I had the situation under control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a thirty minute drive to the location. Hopefully,I&#39;d be able to round up quickly and really meet up with Jaris before the trial. I was surprised the location he gave me was an actual house. I thought it&#39;d be an abandoned building or the temple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath just before I knocked on the door, and the little bit of confidence I felt moments ago faltered when Caden opened up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; he called with a smile, leaning against the frame.&#34;That was fast.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands tightened beside me. &#34;Where are they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped aside. &#34;Do come in..&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A storm of drums thundered in my chest, turning my legs to jelly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have to be alone with him. gods, I wished I didn&#39;t have to do this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the house and flinched when he locked the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I darted my eyes around the large living room.There was no sign of the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might be in one of the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried going further to check the rooms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t waste your time. They&#39;re not here.&#34; What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I snappily turned to him, my eyes wide with rage. &#34;So,where the hell are they?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He went to the wine counter where he took out a bottle of wine and took his time to open it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re being sent back to the Pack.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his words, it felt like I was under a cold shower. Relief crushed my bones, but it was quickly replaced with the last fear I had left-escaping him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;D-Did you hurt them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as he approached me with two glasses of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you even take them? They&#39;re kids, for Moon sake! You don&#39;t involve kids in such nonsense!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated how nonchalant he was whenever | talked about the fact that he&#39;s been unreasonable. He just never seems to care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Here.&#34; He held one of the glasses to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Selene forbidI actually take anything from him. &#34;I don&#39;t want it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes grew cold. &#34;If I have to say it again, you&#39;ll bleed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though furious, I took the glass from him but took it nowhere close to my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned his back to me, my eyes darted to the door. Would it be possible to escape him? Since the kids were safe, if I could get away from here,everything would be fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want with me?&#34; My voice came out raspy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you believe me if I said I was bored and needed someone to talk to?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He took a seat facing me. I watched his eyes eat me up as he drank from his glass. &#34;You&#39;re one gorgeous lady,you know that,right? Your dress-It&#39;s quite pretty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Jaris had been the one saying these words,I imagined how good they&#39;d make me feel. But coming from this monster? All I wanted to do was puke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see you and my brother made up after the little incident at the diner.&#34; His lips tipped up in a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh rage burnt through me at the recollection of what he did and how much it affected Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You mean the one where you tried to trigger your brother? Yeah, we did make up. You know, it&#39;s easy to be understanding when you care about someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the way his smile vanished. It&#39;d have brought a small smile to mine if I wasn&#39;t so scared and nervous right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds passed. He brought his wine to half.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you see in him, huh?&#34; He furrowed his brows in curiosity. &#34;What does everyone see in him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every instant that passed wrapped the moment in deeper sadness. He wasn&#39;t just teasing anymore but was being painfully honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I was supposed to be better than him.Or at least we should&#39;ve been equals. From a young age, Jaris has always had everything I wanted-control, the people&#39;s support. Now, he is about to become King-a position I&#39;ve always wanted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dragged his eyes from my head to toe. &#34;He has a family. Kids.&#34; He hissed the last word. &#34;I thought he couldn&#39;t have kids! Just like me. But like always, he&#39;s different.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? Caden couldn&#39;t have kids?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call me bitter, but I want it all.&#34; He laughed, emptying his glass into his mouth. &#34;I want everything my brother has, and I&#39;m going to get it.&#34; Maybe if it were someone else, I&#39;d have felt bad for them. But coming from Caden, I didn&#39;t feel a thing;not after what he&#39;d done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris didn&#39;t ask to be born different. He didn&#39;t ask to have control and get the people&#39;s support. He and the people around him didn&#39;t deserve to suffer for it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I recoiled when Caden stood up and started toward me. He looked more dangerous, making me take a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to stop moving and stood still until he was standing in front of me. His eyes dropped to my full glass of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t touched your drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh fear gripped me. I could see he was getting tired of talking and wanted to &#39;act&#39;. This was the time to get out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without further hesitation, I splashed the wine on his face,broke the glass on his head and ran for the door while he hissed behind me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d have made it. Oh, gods I&#39;d have made it had the door not been locked when I reached it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. I continuously turned the knob but it wouldn&#39;t open. I didn&#39;t see Caden lock it with a key when I entered, so why couldn&#39;t I open it?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was seized by fear, every fiber of my body quaking as I turned around to look at him, my back pressed against the door. The side of his head was bleeding,his fingers coated in it. He was going to kill me!</p>
