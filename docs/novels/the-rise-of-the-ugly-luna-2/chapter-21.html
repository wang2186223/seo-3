                <p>&#34;You&#39;re terminating the contract.&#34; He repeated. It wasn&#39;t a question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt bad for dad, but now, he&#39;d really have to find a way to pay off his debts. This man just ripped out a man&#39;s heart without blinking. I couldn&#39;t be with someone like him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dark cruel smile played on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You have a copy of the contract with you. Go home and read it. When you&#39;re done, get back to me for the termination.&#34;He turned toward his car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he talking about? &#34;I already read the contract before signing it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to read carefully.&#34; His eyes held mischief as they fell on me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, saviors. What was he on about? He stepped into his already opened car, leaving me stranded there by the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t see Jace at the club anymore, and when l tried to call him, his lines were unreachable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t wait for him as I had a more pressing matter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hurried home, found the contract and took my time to go through the termination clauses. A shiver slithered down my spine when I found the one line l had missed. I could not terminate the contract. Only Jaris had the power to do so, when he sees fit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All I could do was abandon the contract, which was a great violation that could lead to me being locked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tricked me. I may have been careless and missed it, but he tricked me! Because why was he the only one with the power to end the contract?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t breath properly. This only meant that I was stuck with Jaris. For a whole year! How was I even sure I&#39;d make it out alive?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three days had passed since Jaris and I last saw.Two days ago, news of the Alpha King&#39;s death circulated like wildfire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>King Thaddeus had been a fierce but nice ruler. The news of his demise was a hard pill to swallow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every other activity was put on hold as a result of his upcoming funeral. The mating ceremony between Jaris and I also had to be shifted to a week time, and to be honest, it was the best news I&#39;d heard in a while. If it could, I&#39;d want it to be shifted to a year!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today had been fixed to be the King&#39;s funeral. Only the families of Alphas could attend-it was only a measure to control the crowd since there would be a lot of important people in attendance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t want to go, but father insisted. And well,l figured it wouldn&#39;t be a bad time to get some fresh air. I was trying to source for what to wear when a call came in from a strange number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ms. Harper. Good morning. It&#39;s Kael.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael. Jaris&#39; beta.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I became more at alert. &#34;Hi, good morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m calling on behalf of Alpha Jaris to inform you that a car would be there to pick you by two p.m.Alpha Jaris would love you two to journey to Brystara together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brystara. That was the home of the Alpha King.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay,he had to be joking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thanks, but I don&#39;t wanna go with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a slight pause. &#34;I&#39;m afraid it isn&#39;t up for debate, Ms. Harper. He wants you to get ready before the car arrives.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went dead on me. Seriously!? I glared at the screen like I could send a punch to Jaris through it. Well, there was no part of the contract that said I was obligated to go everywhere with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went back to the task at hand, searching for something to wear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An hour later, I was fully ready to go.I didn&#39;t want to be tb last person they had to wait for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like always, I reached for the scan, feeling a crushing relief as I stared at the image. A sad smile touched my lips as I ran my fingers along the edges and surface. I never got to touch them, but I missed them so much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied, I hid the picture and left the room. But right at my doorstep was Nora, her hands crossed, her eyes glaring at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you do to Roderick?&#34; She asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness. &#34;Why wouldn&#39;t he break up with you? Why wouldn&#39;t he see me anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes. &#34;Please, Nora. We&#39;re running late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to leave, but she stood in my way. &#34;I&#39;m talking to you!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;s because I look really beautiful now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, please! Do you think you&#39;re more beautiful than lam?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. Why don&#39;t you ask your supposed boyfriend or fiance why wouldn&#39;t he leave me alone?&#34;I forced my way away from her. &#34;And please, Nora,tell Roderick to end things with me. I&#39;m begging now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father was pleased to see me downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look lovely,my dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a smile. &#34;Thanks, father.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My stepmother was already prepared and gawked at us. Father led me outside to where our cars were waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprisingly, or maybe not too surprisingly, there was an extra one out there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver was beside it but approached me when l stepped out of the house.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good day, ma&#39;am. I was sent to pick you up.&#34; He said with a bow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of it only pissed me off. Jaris was a control freak!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told him I won&#39;t be going with him,&#34; I replied to the man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Father looked at me with surprise.&#34;Lyric...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s just go. Please.&#34; I walked ahead of him, going into our own car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was yet to get over what he did to Matt. He killed that innocent boy for nothing and didn&#39;t even feel a single remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was determined to be away from him as much as possible, until the mating ceremony inevitably brings us together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>SOMEWHERE IN MYSTOPIA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender refilled the woman&#39;s cup for the umpteenth time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as she emptied it in seconds, her eyes fixed on the screen ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender couldn&#39;t tell if she was interested in the sport being aired on the TV. She didn&#39;t strike him like the type that would be interested in such programmes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked fierce, with a deep scar running down the left side of her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The young woman, though pretty, had the looks of someone that cared little for people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The game finally came to an end, and she requested for her bill.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Boring game, huh?&#34; The bartender tsked as he waited for her to bring out her cash. &#34;You should&#39;ve asked me to switch to something more entertaining.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman only glanced at him-slowly-but didn&#39;t say a word. She handed his money to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Gracias.&#34; The bartender said as he took her glass and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I am looking for someone,&#34; the woman finally spoke,drawing his attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned around to see a picture now on the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bartender shook his head at once. It was a lady with an ugly scar. He hadn&#39;t met anyone like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry I can&#39;t help you.&#34; Saying nothing, the woman tucked the picture back into her pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who&#39;s she?&#34; The bartender was curious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman was already on her feet, dragging her weapon sheath. &#34;She&#39;s someone that shouldn&#39;t live amongst us. Someone dangerous.&#34;</p>
