                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anxiety climbed higher like a steep heel when one of the men called her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, tell me you have something good for me,&#34;she said with optimism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, ma&#39;am. We were able to find one relative of Penelope.Her sister.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s eyes widened as the hairs on the back of her neck bristled. &#34;A-Are you serious? Where does she live? You need to check if Penelope is with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Her name is Cora. We just got her address and will be keeping a tab on her to know if she&#39;s heard anything about Penelope.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. You cannot miss this up. Not this. Do you understand?&#34; &#34;Yes,ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh,gods! Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you do this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were too many voices. All distorted. I couldn&#39;t make out which belonged to who or what was even happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes were still closed, my head aching, same with my abdomen. It hurt all over, and the distorted voices around me weren&#39;t making it any better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric! Wake up!&#34; Someone shook me roughly. They sounded urgent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the intense pain, I forced my eyes open.The memories came flooding me as I did. Luna Isolde. My baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods,my baby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes opened fully as I looked around, fresh horror gripping me. The room was filled with people. Jaris,Marta, Kael and Nerion, Jace, some guards, maids and even the nannies. They all looked shocked.Some were crying. Some screaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Were they acting this way because of me? Was my condition that bad?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace was kneeling beside me, his bloody hands digging into his hair, pulling at his roots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Lyric! Why did you do it?&#34; His voice was filled with so much pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t understand. Why did I do what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jaris again. That was when I realized he looked pale. His eyes were bloodshot red, but they were filled with a certain kind of shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wasn&#39;t close to me like Jace was. Why was everyone this way? Did I lose my child?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too weak to sit up, but at this point, I had to force myself to see what was going on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed to, my head still wobbly from the hit. The first sight I caught was that of blood between my legs.My eyes widened in horror. A ball of fear formed in the pit of my stomach, crawling upward until it burst out as a scream from my throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My baby!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another sight in my peripheral caught me and I had to look. There was a body on the floor, just a few steps from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Luna Isolde.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time seemed to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I froze, my eyes zeroing in on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was...dead? No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked away and shook my head, trying to replay the incident in my head. She attacked me and kept hitting me until I passed out. How was she dead?Who killed her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maddy was kneeling beside her, crying her eyes out.My heart raced in my chest as a strange fear struck me so hard. Suddenly, Maddy looked at me, her eyes red with tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You killed my mother!&#34; She yelled at me. &#34;How could you?! Why?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d never been more confused in my entire life. Was this a dream? Or was I hallucinating as a result of the repeated hits?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at Jace, silently demanding an explanation.He shook his head disappointedly, his hands still in his hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What happened, Lyric? Were you two in a fight?Why did you kill her?&#34; He asked me. I managed to shake my head. &#34;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. I didn&#39;t kill anyone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You siphoned her!&#34; Maddy yelled. &#34;How could you kill the Grand Luna? How could you kill my mother?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp pain struck me in the abdomen, causing me to shut my eyes and grunt. Jace quickly wrapped his hand around mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t kill her,&#34;. I whimpered in a fragile voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could I when l&#39;d been unconscious? I was the victim here!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you didn&#39;t? How do you explain this, then?&#34;Maddy took up her hand, showing me the nail marks on her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now the whole thing really looked like a dream.Because right now, it appeared she&#39;d been killed by a Siphon. But there was no way it was me.I passed out while she was hitting me and only regained consciousness. How could I have siphoned her when I was unconscious?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It doesn&#39;t make any sense,&#34; I shook my head, tears beginning to fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw my head back and let out a painful grunt. My entire body ached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We need to get her to a doctor. Please!&#34; It was Jace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered as I looked at Jaris. A painful realization hit me. His mother was dead. And they all believe l did it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris...&#34; I called with a wavering tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But his eyes remained empty. He didn&#39;t even look like he was here. Gods, I&#39;d never seen Jaris look this way before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I threw my head back on the floor.&#34;She attacked me. My baby... I didn&#39;t do it. I passed out.&#34;|didn&#39;t even know if I was making any sense. I just kept the words coming as much as | could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How did you have the heart to siphon my mother?&#34; Maddy rose to her feet, her eyes still wet with tears.&#34;Were the Executioners right all along? Did we make a mistake keeping you with us?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharp pains shot through me. I couldn&#39;t tell if it was from the physical wounds or the one coming from my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone looked at me like I was a curse. They were all terrified of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m taking her to the clinic. She&#39;s in pain,&#34; Jace said as he wrapped his arms around me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it,&#34; I uttered weakly. &#34;Please.. I didn&#39;t do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace carried me in his arms and ran for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As we passed Jaris, I tried to touch him. But he was still too far away. He wasn&#39;t even looking at me but kept his eyes on his mother&#39;s corpse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please...&#34; Please, believe me. I didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;d never hurt you this way. I tried to stay awake. I needed to beg them to believe me. But the soon was too much, and so was the urge to fall asleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave in when I couldn&#39;t resist any further.</p>
