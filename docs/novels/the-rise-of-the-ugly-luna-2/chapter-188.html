                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She texted the location and I was there in no time.She opened up when I rang the bell, and the moment I laid eyes on her, I forgot about my worries for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was wearing a thigh-length night dress-short enough to reveal her thick thighs. It had a matching jacket, but it did nothing to hide the beauty of her cleavages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair was down and on her shoulders, her face bare of makeup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just a nude-colored dress, yet she looked beyond sexy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until I stopped looking at her flesh and looked at her face instead that I realized how sore her eyes were. It drew a frown on my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been crying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head while trucking some strands of hair behind her ear. Now who was she kidding?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way into the small cozy room. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here,&#34; she mumbled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And where else should I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. With the grand Luna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words struck me deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was about to say something when she suddenly winced and clutched her tummy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey!&#34; I rushed to hold back, but she stepped back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you still sick? I thought you were getting better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; She stopped wincing, her tone hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t look fine.&#34; I tried going to her again. &#34;You need to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please! I told you I&#39;m fine.&#34; This time, she snapped,still taking more steps away from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced myself to give her some space.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I&#39;m not mad, Jaris. I-I really don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re here &#39;cause I&#39;m sure the party is still-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34; I cut her off, closing my eyes briefly. &#34;I wanted to tell you, Lyric. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t find the right time, but I planned on telling you on the jet today. It wasn&#39;t my intention for you to find out this way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My words didn&#39;t seem to have much effect on her.Instead, the hurt in her eyes grew, like she was more wounded I was admitting to the fact that I had it in mind to make Marta my Luna this whole time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve just told me,&#34; she chuckled-though it was forced. &#34;I mean, I don&#39;t get why you think it was a big deal. Marta is a cool lady.Plus, y-you:ve known her before me. So, I think it&#39;s pretty fine to-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had to do it for the kids,&#34; I cut in, already knowing where her thoughts were headed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her brows drew together as she looked at me with perplexity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The Elders told me they&#39;d be regarded as outcasts if I didn&#39;t get married to their mother. They said I could marry any woman of my choice,but when that woman had children, only hers would be regarded as legitimate.Xylon would not have access to the throne.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched as her lips parted, shock reflecting in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A-Are you serious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shrugged. &#34;Marta might be cool to some people,but I&#39;d never intentionally pick someone like her to be my Luna.&#34; I gave a slight pause. &#34;I didn&#39;t even think it was possible for me to have kids. Xylon and Xyla... they&#39;re more than a blessing to me. And it&#39;s possible I&#39;d never have another apart from them. So,what&#39;s the point of making them illegitimate, huh,when they&#39;re all I have?Quite unfortunate I have to end up with Marta.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She brushed her fingers into her hair as she turned away. I watched her amble to the window, still pulling at her roots.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Lyric.&#34; I apologized for the second time tonight. &#34;I never wanted it to go like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She might not say it, but I knew she was broken by it.She was hoping to be Grand Luna, and I didn&#39;t know anyone more deserving of the position.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But unfortunately, things don&#39;t always go as planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how to stay mad at Jaris after his explanation the previous night. Even I would&#39;ve chosen my kids I was in his shoes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, I didn&#39;t blamne him. But that didn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t hurt that things turned out this way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Marta would have to get married and they&#39;d be together forever. For me? There was no place for me. It wasn&#39;t like there ever was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Our flight back to Darkspire was scheduled for that morning. While getting ready in the room, I felt nauseated again and threw up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was getting worse. I&#39;d been taking my medicine and all,yet none of it was working. And it was as if the sickness only occured in the mornings and evenings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I know I&#39;d laughed at Guinevere and the Pack doctor when they suggested it, but the symptoms were really beginning to look like what they suspected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it didn&#39;t make any sense. I hadn&#39;t been intimate with anyone for six years! How could I possibly be pregnant?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And of course, it wasn&#39;t possible to get pregnant through some crazy sex-dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But right now, it looked like there was nothing else to do other than to perform the test. Maybe it&#39;d finally clarify things so I&#39;d be sure there was something else wrong with me, not pregnancy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, I concluded that I&#39;d do a pregnancy test as soon as I reached home. Jaris&#39; family was also flying back with us</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris and I reached the airport together and headed to the boarding gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We sat next to each other in the room of the jet, but a while later, he excused himself to do something,and that was when Marta came in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was literally glowing. I couldn&#39;t begin to imagine how happy she must be to be getting married to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric darling,&#34; she crossed her legs as she took the seat Jaris had occupied. &#34;Don&#39;t you think I should be the one in that seat?&#34; She jutted her chin toward where I was sitting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I mean, Jaris and I will be getting married in three days. It&#39;s only right we get enough space to bond.Right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had a smug smile on her face, looking so proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; I scoffed. &#34;You&#39;ve been with this guy for six years, had kids for him, yet you don&#39;t have even the slightest bond, do you?&#34; | clicked my tongue, shaking my head. &#34;That&#39;s quite sad, Marta. Anyway, not to worry,you can bond all you want when we get home.For now,he wants me to sit beside him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t miss the glint that crossed her eyes just before she smiled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine.&#34; She leaned back, crossing her arms. &#34;You can stay here fo now. Afterall, it&#39;s only temporary.I guess people were right when they said good things come to them that wait. You started off being his mate, but guess who&#39;s Grand Luna today?&#34; She laughed and stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I were you, I&#39;d be more respectful to me considering the difference in our position. Trust me,you wouldn&#39;t want to mess with me right now, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was difficult pretending her words didn&#39;t sting so bad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sad,&#34; I huffed. &#34;That you see this position as a tool for power, not a responsibility to lead. The people deserve better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile was gone in an instant. Fortunately, Jaris returned before she could say anything else. So, she had to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris had been trying so hard to make things right between us. Trying to make me laugh and all. But it was really tasky as I was still hurt, no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Today&#39;s revelation only proved to me that my position in his life was only temporary, and maybe I&#39;d gotten to a point where I thought I could be more.... He left for a meeting as soon as we reached Darkspire while I went ahead to get a teststrip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite being so sure I wasn&#39;t pregnant, my hands still shook as I stood in the bathroom, waiting for the test lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Idle and out of curiosity, I imagined what would happen if I was actually pregnant for Jaris. That would be me having three kids for him. I laughed in my head about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Last night, when he mentioned Xylon and Xyla were all he had, I couldn&#39;t deny feeling a little hurt.I loved how he loved those kids, but it was sad he didn&#39;t know he had two more he could love like that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,imagine making it three. That was hilarious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mirth, however, vanished when the second line appeared on the strip. My brows tightened, thoughts racing in my mind yet none of them seemed factual.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two red lines.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did two red lines mean again?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I dropped the strip, reached for my phone and googled it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, of course I wasn&#39;t dumb. I perfectly knew what two red lines meant. But something about it was not making me believe it anymore. Because how the hell was I pregnant?!</p>
