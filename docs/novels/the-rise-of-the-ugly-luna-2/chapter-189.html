                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept tapping my legs against the floor, my arms wrapped around myself as I sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was shaking. Didn&#39;t even know if it was cold from the nausea or due to how shocked, worried and scared I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at the clock. It&#39;s been thirty minutes. What the hell was taking him so long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stood up, pacing the room with my nails digging into my hair from time to time. When I heard the door opening, I snappily turned like he was some sort of savior I&#39;d been waiting on for ages.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright?&#34; He rushed forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I figured he must&#39;ve been pretty worried considering how I called and demanded his presence at home immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, I&#39;m not.&#34; My tone was biting. &#34;As a matter of fact,I&#39;m losing my mind and-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, calm down and talk to me. What&#39;s going on?&#34; I closed my eyes and took in a very deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you been sleeping with me before now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The question seemed to freeze the air. Asking it myself actually made me more scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, I never thought I&#39;d be saying this to you,but months before now, you and I...we used to have these sex dreams. It only happened in my dreams,you know, and I was sure that was all it was. But now...&#34;laughed. &#34;It might seem I&#39;d been delusional. So please,tell me the truth. Have you been sleeping with me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His silence was killing. Why wasn&#39;t he saying anything?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you leave those pills in my room?!&#34; My voice climbed a step higher &#34;Wh-Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes widened in horror. The guilt and disappointment was becoming more evident on his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, gods.&#34; I took some steps back. &#34;It was you.&#34; Fear gripped my throat so tight my next words were actually difficult to share. &#34;Those pills...were they even real? I mean, did they only sedate me to make me think the sex were dreams? What have you been doing to me!?&#34; He stopped toward me, holding out his hands. &#34;Lyric, &#34;No, don&#39;t touch me!&#34; I yelled. &#34;For two months, you deceived me! Had access to my body without even my knowledge and made me believe it was a dream!How could anyone be so evil?! How could you do this to me? Yet, you got pissed off by the things your brother did? You did worst! You&#39;ve been raping me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t like that!&#34; It was his turn to yell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;d seen Jaris look so guilty before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, I&#39;m sorry, Lyric. I didn&#39;t-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry?&#34; I laughed sarcastically. &#34;You think sorry can fix this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I admit-it was my biggest mistake. I should&#39;ve done better-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you just don&#39;t care about people, do you? You only care about getting what you want, no matter who gets hurt. Including sleeping with an unconscious woman.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you stop cutting me off?!&#34; His eyes were getting darker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell? &#34;That&#39;s all you&#39;re concerned about right now? You just got me pregnant and you&#39;re only concerned about me raising my voice?!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the words were out that I hated myself for not thinking. I held my breath as I turned away from him,digging my hands into my hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a full minute, Jaris was dead silent. As was l,looking away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s not possible,&#34; he finally said, his voice barely above a whisper and edged with disbelief. &#34;You can&#39;t -You can&#39;t be. I mean, I used protection all the time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned angrily at him. &#34;Well, I guess if the sex had been consensual, I&#39;d have noticed the times the condom broke or something. I didn&#39;t get myself pregnant!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The memory came running to me-one morning when I&#39;d woken up and found myself wetter than usual. I&#39;d waved it off as something normal considering I&#39;d been horny during the night. Now, it made sense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris shook his head, his eyes flying to my belly.&#34;You&#39;re pregnant?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face became blurry. Took me a moment to realize I was crying.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fuck, Lyric.&#34; He turned toward the door, his hand going to his forehead. Gods, I shouldn&#39;t have told him. How unfortunate that my mouth was faster than my brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I grabbed my bag and keys, wiping my tears as l headed to the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait. Where are you going?&#34; Jaris held my hand before I could open the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,I can&#39;t deal with this right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No,we need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know,&#34; I sniffled, forcing my hand free from his.&#34;I love kids and all, but I don&#39;t need this right now.I have a lot going on in my life that....that makes all of this an inconvenience. I mean, yours is just set out-you&#39;ll be King, the mother of your children by your side as Luna. And me?&#34; I shrugged pathetically. &#34;I am just stuck here, ready to leave when my time with you is up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More tears came spilling down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t have forced this on me, Jaris. Not now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled and started toward the door. His hand reached for mine, grabbing me in an instant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,we need to talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I can&#39;t.&#34; My voice broke even more. &#34;Not now. I can&#39;t even think straight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to wipe my face, but more tears just came running down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was fucking pregnant! Had a life inside of me. How did this happen?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,let me go. Please.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally did. And I left without looking back.</p>
