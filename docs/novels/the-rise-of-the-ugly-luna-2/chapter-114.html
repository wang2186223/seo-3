                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t stop running until I was outside by the parking lot. I was about running to my car when I remembered I&#39;d arranged for someone to drive it home since l thought I&#39;d be going home with Jaris from our dinner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to go to the road, then. I could board a cab or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was a crying mess. Even my vision was blurred with tears. I hoped I wouldn&#39;t bump into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as I turned around, I did bump into someone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; Jaris held me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything came on me at once. Shame. Guilt. HHe must think I was incompetent. Even if he&#39;d been supportive of me in there, a part of him must be angry at me. A part of him must doubt me at least.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let me go,&#34; | whimpered, struggling against his hold.I didn&#39;t want to be with anyone right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His grip on me was relentless. &#34;Hey, calm down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. Please.&#34; I kept crying. I&#39;d never felt so broken in my life. People were dead,and everyone thought I was responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it,&#34; I finally stopped struggling and just whimpered. &#34;I don&#39;t-I don&#39;t know how it happened but I didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;ll never be that careless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know,&#34; he uttered to my surprise, then pulled me into his arms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything was overwhelming. If this was under a normal circumstance, I&#39;d have expressed my shock over Jaris&#39; actions. He supported me in there when everyone was against me, he believed me when everyone thought I was lying. And now, he was hugging me. Jaris Dreadmoor was hugging me.Someone that had said awful things to me just four days ago, and in return, I&#39;d wanted to stay away from him.Now, I was finding comfort in his embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t do it. I didn&#39;t kill them,&#34;&#39; I continued sobbing,my whimpers muffled against his shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If someone had told me Jaris had this side to his personality, I&#39;d never have believed. He treated me way better than an egg that night. Kept asking if I was okay and needed anything throughout the ride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we got to Darkspire, he put his arm around me as he led me to my room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you don&#39;t need anything?&#34; He asked one more time as he stood on my doorway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it wasn&#39;t for how comforting he had been, I was sure I&#39;d have been crying the whole ride home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine. Thanks.&#34; I sniffled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although,I wished I had a friend to keep mecompany.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If only Jace was still here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Jaris took a step back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe it was just me, or did Jaris look hesitant to leave?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, he&#39;d have to. We didn&#39;t have that kind of relationship yet. I didn&#39;t mean enough to him to get him to stay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodnight, Lyric.&#34; He said and was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up to an email from the HR department,telling me not to report to work for now until I received further instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I expected this. I knew there was no way l&#39;d simply walk back into TCH like four people didn&#39;t die last night because of me. Or so everyone thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, it hurt to see the email. It hurt so badI cried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was going to lose my job. After everything, I was going to be kicked out of the hospital. I felt cursed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A knock on my door snapped me out of my anguish.I sniffled and wiped my face completely before going to get it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart skipped a beat when I came face to face with Alpha Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;G-Good morning.&#34; I darted my eyes to the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was wearing a suit pant with a white crispy top, the top two buttons undone. No doubt, he was going to work. But he looked way too hot for that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wondered what kind of a boss he was at the office.I imagined all his female staff crushing on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34; He seemed to take in my form, slowly. &#34;How was your night?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay.&#34;I nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d developed a terrible headache from crying too much. So, when I showered and changed, it was actually easy falling sleep. Although, my dreams were filled with nightmarish images of the people dying. &#34;Going to TCH today?&#34; He asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart clenched from the question. &#34;No. They uh...sent me an email this morning, telling me to wait for further instructions.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt sostrange sharing my problems with Jaris. But l wouldn&#39;t deny that it actually felt good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry,&#34; he sighed. &#34;It&#39;ll all be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stepped back, and I realized he was about leaving.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris.&#34; I hesitated. &#34;Please don&#39;t... Don&#39;t try to use your influence or anything to get involved. It&#39;s possible I made a mistake. Maybe, I did confuse the tags. Those people might have really died because of me. So, if the hospital thinks I should be penalized...&#34;I exhaled deeply. &#34;...Then, maybe I deserve to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows furrowed, like he was surprised I could utter those words. He probably thought I&#39;d be one of those people who would happily use connections to get out of shitty situations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, not this. Not when lives were involved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&#34; He gave a clipped nod before walking away. I told Jace what happened. He was so worried and bent on seeing me. He went as far as saying he was ready to defy Jaris&#39; order and come to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But since we didn&#39;t want that to happen, I had to find my way to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It had been long since I visited his Pack.Plus,I needed to clear my head and all. So, I decided to go to his place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was busy on my phone while climbing down the staircase and didn&#39;t notice someone standing at the end of the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, I looked just in time before I&#39;d bump into them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodness! So sorry, I didn&#39;t see you.&#34;I put a hand on my chest, taking a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I took a proper look at her, realizing she didn&#39;t look familiar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked quite young but fierce, a hair that went all the way to her waist, and cold familiar silver eyes</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric Harper.&#34; She folded her arms.&#34;Or do you prefer Dreadmoor?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows furrowed. Who was she? &#34;You&#39;re so pretty,&#34; she shook her head. &#34;When they told me, I had no idea it&#39;d be this serious. Which makes me even more curious; what the hell are you doing with my brother?&#34;</p>
