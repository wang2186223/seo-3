                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went numb. Couldn&#39;t think straight for a full minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even know which was more devastating-the realization that Lyric was never going to rule beside me, or the painful fact that someone like Marta was going to be my wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made my head ache.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;....Alpha Jaris!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t realize they&#39;d been calling me until Luca touched my arm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, dragging myself back to the present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t have to do it if you don&#39;t want to,&#34; Landon said. &#34;You could just focus on Luna Lyric, but only her kids would be acknowledged. When she has a son, he&#39;ll become King after you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the situation permitted it, I&#39;d have fucking laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the point; they didn&#39;t know nothing. They had no idea that Lyric couldn&#39;t even be my wife.We had a stupid contract between us which was only going to last for a year. Well, less than a year now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fuck, I&#39;d always known this. So, why the hell was it seeming so painful now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than ten months, Lyric Harper would be gone from my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;ll never get to see her smiles again, hear her laughter, or get the satisfaction I felt when I see her playing with the kids. She&#39;d be gone for good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But this was the deal. It shouldn&#39;t mean anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could get married to someone else; someone more deserving than Marta. But Xylon was my first son.I didn&#39;t want him growing up to feel hurt and neglected. He deserved to be King after me. Xyla roo deserved to be fully acknowledged as daughter of the Alpha King. I didn&#39;t want them growing up with that tag of &#39;Born out of wedlock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What the hell was I supposed to do?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I left Jaris, I went ahead to meet up with Jace.He was with Kael when I arrived, the two seeming to have a peaceful conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Jace came over to meet me as soon as he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m looking for Elder Mathias. I didn&#39;t see him on stage today,&#34; I went straight to the point when we finished greeting each other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, he didn&#39;t show up today. Neither did his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I let out a frustrated sigh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. Could you give me his address or something?&#34; &#34;Lyric, why won&#39;t you tell me what the problem is?What do you have with this Penelope woman?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair, not knowing what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody knew I was pregnant five years ago. I felt a little embarrassed to admit it to Jace right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I just... I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t talk about it for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He insisted, but when he saw that he couldn&#39;t get it out of me, he let it be. But he promised to send me the address as soon as he got it from his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael and I left for the car together. While waiting for Jace, I put a call through to Juan as I&#39;d missed her own call earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so excited and kept congratulating me for Jaris&#39; win. They all believed I was going to be the Capital Luna.How sad.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ended the call when I spotted Jaris approaching.Just like that, the butterflies returned in ten folds. He looked so handsome in the navy blue suit that hugged his frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, I felt lucky being the one beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My smile dropped when I knocked the mood he was in. He didn&#39;t seem happy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are... Are you alright?&#34; | inquired when he got close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He drew a deep breath and looked at me.Surprisingly, he held my gaze for a long time, as if searching for something in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be fine,&#34; he muttered. &#34;We should go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He got into the car before me, not sparing another glance my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Uncertainty took root deep within me. Tonight was supposed to be a happy one for us. Why was he sad?What did the Elders tell him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just like the night of the firsttrial, another party was being held when we got back to Darkspire. But even that was not enough to brighten Jaris&#39;mood. I could tell he was only forcing himself to enjoy the party.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later at night, when the party had ended and I was alone in my room, I stared at the pill in one hand, and the paint in the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tonight was the night I got to find answers. To know if my dream was real or not.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took the pill and tightened my hand with the paint into a fist, just before the sudden effect took place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything seemed to twirl and spiral for me, but l managed to get on the bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like always, it felt good already. My body had already gotten so used to this that whenever it happened,l was looking forward to my &#39;dream man.&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heavy eyelids went closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long it took, but I moaned in response when I felt his hands on my legs. He was here again. Like every other night when l needed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But tonight was a test.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He crawled up to me, cupped my cheeks and kissed me.Deeply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hm. The Jaris in my dream was better than the one I&#39;d left the Capital with. That one had been sad and quiet toward me and everyone around him. This one seemed hungry for me. I liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I reciprocated the kiss, running my hand down his neck. In the process, I did what I had in mind. The palm with the paint ran against the back of his nape,covering it with the light blue color.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t notice and won&#39;t know until I&#39;m able to check in the morning. Even when he showered, it won&#39;t come off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, if this was only a dream, the paint won&#39;t be there by morning. But if I was being tricked this whole time and any of this was real, then I&#39;d see it when I check.</p>
