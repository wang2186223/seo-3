                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was an important text I&#39;d been waiting for, and as soon as it came in, I left the office even though it wasn&#39;t closing hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca left with me, sitting in the passenger seat while I drove.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I only started taking her along a month ago when I discovered she&#39;d known the whole time but hadn&#39;t said a word. She&#39;d been of great help to me. Was a good lady,actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You should&#39;ve let me drive, ma&#39;am. You look exhausted,&#34; she complained beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I always look exhausted, Bianca.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the words left my mouth, my eyes found the rearview mirror in front of me. Sadness threatened to rip me apart at thebleak reflection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wasn&#39;t lacking in clothes and adornment. Caden made sure I received enough of it and always leftthe house with enough makeup on. But that was just as much as he could do to my physical appearance because no matter how hard you tried to make the body look good, there were certain kinds of pretense the body still wouldn&#39;t fall for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over the months, I&#39;d grown thinner. Although it didn&#39;t look bad enough for anyone to think I was starving,but it was bad enough for the people who knew me before to know l&#39;d not been at peace. This was something Caden had not been able to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I barely had appetite, spent my days being busy working in the company or executing Caden&#39;s orders, and had sleepless nights most of the time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I woke up most mornings with headaches. Most times, I&#39;d feel suffocated from being in a place I didn&#39;t want to be. On nights I managed to sleep, I&#39;d have terrible dreams-the ones of me and Jaris. They&#39;d start happy at first with our beautiful memories and all, then slowly depreciate until the very point where I siphoned him to forget all about me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, I&#39;d wake up in tears, hating myself for giving him up even though I knew I didn&#39;t have a choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people out there believed I was Caden&#39;s Queen and living my best life. They had no idea I was going through the worst phase of my life.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took Bianca and I two hours to reach our destination. We were in the Capital City-a place we both had no business being in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was dangerous. I could get killed for being here, and Caden would have my head if he ever gets to learn of this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t help it. It wasn&#39;t often I get this opportunity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We were parked by the side of the road in a deserted place where I was sure there was no one around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I moved to the backseat where I changed into my casual clothes. Bianca did the same. Afterwards,l attached the fake beards and moustache, then put the hoodie over my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca changed as well, tied a scarf around her face in the usual way that only revealed her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While I appeared like a man, she appeared like someone from the North.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We continued the drive into the City, ready to mingle with the rest of the people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though I was making a dangerous move, watching the scene in front of me made it all worth it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t stop smiling as I sat on the bench, watching the kids play from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were in an amusement park with Maddy, running around and having so much fun. Maddy had made it a point of duty to bring them to the park from time to time. Fortunately for me, I used the opportunity to see them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Should I take a picture?&#34; Bianca whispered beside me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She often made it seem like we were spies and she wasn&#39;t supposed to raise her voice when talking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No. I don&#39;t want us to look suspicious.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the little girl has a new hairstyle. Wouldn&#39;t you want a memory of it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took out her phone, zoomed in on them and stylishly took a picture, in a way I was sure no one noticed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca didn&#39;t know who the kids truly were to me. To the best of her knowledge, I was simply attached to them as we&#39;d been very close before now. She was one of the guests at their birthday party and had seen how they picked me for the games over their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her words, she fell in love with our relationship at that time and perfectly understood why I had a hard time detaching from them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How does it look?&#34; She asked as she showed me the picture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart warmed at the sight of it and I ended up staring longer than necessary.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s beautiful,&#34; I stared back at them. &#34;Have it printed out. Make sure no one sees it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You got it, ma&#39;am.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately, we had to leave at some point. I still had to get home early enough to avoid Caden&#39;s suspicions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Bianca and I reached the car, we found someone waiting beside it. An old friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jace!&#34; I made to hug him but quickly restricted myself when I remembered we were in public and I looked like a man. It&#39;d be weird if I jumped on him like a woman. &#34;Hey.&#34; He touched my arm. &#34;How was your day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine,I guess.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced over my shoulder at the park behind. &#34;You done with them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah. Thanks for the tip.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already knew what was coming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;d love to keep helping you meet them, but it&#39;s dangerous. How long do you think it&#39;ll take before you get caught somehow?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know, Jace. But believe me, I&#39;ve been careful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful is never enough and you know it. You&#39;re in forbidden territory.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes dropped to the floor, the harsh reality of his words punching me in the guts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I miss you, Lyric. I&#39;m sure the kids do too. But you&#39;re taking a huge risk. If you ever get caught by Jaris, I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll hurt you really bad. The guy has become something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words twisted my heart in a painful grip.Oh, Jaris...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll try to stop. I just ...&#34; I sighed heavily. &#34;Seeing them keeps me sane, Jace. It makes me want to keep living.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But you&#39;re right. Just...one last time. I&#39;Il see them once more and that&#39;ll be it. I&#39;ll stop, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me a disapproving look but fortunately didn&#39;t argue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you for the help so far.&#34; I bobbed my head and made my way to the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reached for my hand before I could open the door. Bianca was already on the other side of the car, so she wouldn&#39;t hear us this time. &#34;How have you really been, Lyric?&#34; He kept his voice low, letting me see the seriousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I managed a small smile. &#34;I&#39;ve been fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, rolling my eyes to disperse the gathering tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s been hard, Jace. But it&#39;s all worth it. Knowing Jaris åand the kids are fine...&#34; I chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s worth it for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let go of my hand, his eyes holding so much sadness that was rarely seen in them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have to go,&#34; I muttered before entering the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart felt heavy as I walked into the mansion-Caden&#39;s palace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a place that looked like a piece of heaven; yet it was always going to be my personal hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The men dipped their heads as I walked past them at the door. I&#39;d been hoping that somehow, he&#39;d be out of the house. But his cars were complete out there, hinting at my doom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt fortunate when I didn&#39;t find him in the living room. Maybe I could make it to my room without seeing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But who was I kidding? He was right there, waiting at my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had his legs crossed in front of him as he leaned against the wall, his hands casually tucked in his pockets. He looked so intimidating; in the kind of way that always made me want to be away from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monster himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re late.&#34; The coldness in his voice almost gave me a shiver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I forced my head to remain high, trying as much as I could to hide the jitters he made me feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I had extra work to take care of.&#34; &#34;Hm.&#34; He tilted his head. &#34;And somehow, it didn&#39;t include you going to Marcus.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An alarm went off in my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shit! Marcus was the last person I was supposed to take care of for the day. I completely forgot when Jace texted me that the kids were visiting the amusement park.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mask slipped for a second, making my fear a little visible.</p>
