                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect her to be so stubborn over a mere necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfortunately for me, my suite had been facing the very spot where she was seated. So, I could see how long she spent, being stubborn and refusing to leave without it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been curious enough to open the locket and to my surprise, it turned out to be ashes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was old tradition to burn corpses and preserve their ashes. Nobody did this anymore. So,why would she do it? And who did she do it for?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made me understand why it was so imnportant to her. And for a reason I couldn&#39;t explain, I was forced to go out and hand it back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so furious. Never seen that much anger in her eyes before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And as she walked out the gate, I continued watching her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It happened swiftly. She hadn&#39;t been in the way or anything, yet a car ran into her, knocking her to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It felt as though, breath had been knocked out of my lungs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I acted on impulse, running toward her,ahead of the securities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver took off, leaving her abandoned by the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something was wrong. She had been in the safe lane. Did that car run into her on purpose?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to where she was and scooped her into my arms without hesitation. She was passed out and bleeding from the head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damnit!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thankfully, the suite had a health care for urgent situations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have someone follow that car. I want him brought to me!&#34; I ordered the securities around and watched them hurry to execute the order.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran into the suite, heading straight to the health care center.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric was well taken care of. It was reassuring when the nurses told me she&#39;d be awake in a few hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got to know she had a dormant wolf. Funny how this was never mentioned to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Apparently, it was the reason she couldn&#39;t heal on her own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the imminent danger out of the way, I ordered her taken to my suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had booked the suite with two rooms. It was the only one available at the timing of booking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I laid Lyric in the second room, then went out to speak with the securities that had gone after the driver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Disappointing enough, they&#39;d been unable to catch up with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But why would anyone do this to Lyric? It was obvious the car didn&#39;t have the intention of killing her. It only wanted to hurt her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whoever was behind this, it must be someone who knew she didn&#39;t have an active wolf and would take long to heal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a strange reason, yet again, this fueled me with so much rage. Even my wolf stirred angrily. WVhy would anyone do this to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called for Nerion who was sharing the next suite with Kael.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nerion, being my head of security, was very good with digging information. When it came to hacking and being smart, I didn&#39;t think he had a rival.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need you to find everything you can on Lyric Haper. First, I need to know what her connection is with Roderick Fletcher. And more importantly, find out if she&#39;s lost anyone important to her in recent years,and if the person&#39;s corpse had gotten incinerated.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One good thing about Nerion was the fact that he enjoyed getting new tasks. He loved it when he was busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Right on it, Alpha,&#34; he said witha dip and left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I returned to Lyric&#39;s room, grabbed a chair and watched how peacefully she slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Retrieving the necklace from my pocket, I opened the locket and felt a sharp pang in my chest when the ashes came into view.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who did you lose, Lyric Harper?&#34; I mnurmured to myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was exactly three a.m when she finally woke up. I was still on the chair, going through my phone when l noticed her stir awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked around, and when her eyes landed on me, surprise clouded her visage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked like she was about to throw a million questions at me, but then she touched her bandaged head,and her expression turned sour.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were in an accident,&#34; I informed her. Just in case you&#39;re forgetting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who was it? Did he wait around?&#34; The way she asked, she must also suspect it was intentional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shook my head, hating how disappointing that was. &#34;They couldn&#39;t catch up with him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She darted her eyes around the room for a second time. &#34;Where aml?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;In my suite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked at me like I&#39;d just told her she&#39;d been sold to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You were in an accident, Lyric. The suite had a health care center. When they were done treating you,I had to bring you to my room. I only had to do this because people would talk if they got to know l abandoned my soon-to-be Luna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave me a quizzical look. &#34;So, you do care what people say, after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I chose my rumours,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She touched her neck and paled. Knowing what she was about to ask next, I held the necklace up to her.&#34;It&#39;s here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She peeled herself from the bed, coming to get it from me. Well, she had been through a lot. So,I didn&#39;t let her struggle for it and just handed it over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, she started for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; My brows arched.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right. I thought you were going to fix the door or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have an extra room where I&#39;ll be spending the night. Get back to bed, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t want to,&#34; she snapped. &#34;Not to sound ungrateful, but don&#39;t you think it&#39;s your fault I got hit in the first place? If you hadn&#39;t taken this from me, I wouldn&#39;t have been here in the first place.&#34; Her eyes flashed with hurt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe she had the right to be mad, but I didn&#39;t really care. The least she could do was thank me for letting her touch my bed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her hand around the door&#39;s knob. The woman was getting on my nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Damn it, Lyric! Get back here before I do something crazy!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That did the trick. She visibly shuddered and looked at me with a kind of fear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Maybe that came out harsher than expected. But there was only little I could do when I had someone constantly upsetting me. A fucking tear dropped to her cheek. But she walked away from the door, back to the bed, sitting with a huff and her arms crossed. Well, I didn&#39;t care that she looked like a brewing hurricane right now. As long as she was there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you need anything, ring the landline,&#34; I told her before taking my leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Honestly, I wasn&#39;t sure I could survive one year with this woman. She was frustratingly infuriating.</p>
