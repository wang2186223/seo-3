                <p>CADEN</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alphas still looked at him beady-eyed. So he elaborated. &#34;For centuries, your fathers before you have had to suffer being kept in the low ranks. They were Alphas to the people, yet still slaves to some of the Alphas who placed themselves above. Why. did there have to be ranks in the first place? Who made that decision? In a world such as this, it was crazy that you have to fight to earn a say among your fellow Alphas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Now, take a look at everything that&#39;s happening. You all still get blamed for things you should be consoled for.Even when the higher Alphas are wrong, you get punished for it. This is not living to me. And that is why I&#39;m here to save you from the injustice you&#39;ve been facing. I&#39;m here to offer you a world you can rule, where everyone will be equal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence draped over the hall. The Alphas exchanged glances. They didn&#39;t say a word to each other, but the same thoughts ran through their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um... Caden,&#34; Jaxen adjusted in his seat. &#34;What makes you think you can get us to trust you? I mean,you&#39;re a forbidden Wolf. We shouldn&#39;t even be having this meeting with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, here you are-all eager to hear what I had to say. Why? Because a part of you is hopeful, isn&#39;t it?&#34; He paused for effect. &#34;Let&#39;s be honest-we&#39;re all monsters. My brother who is always glorified over me is no better than me, and we all know it. I guess at the end of the day, it all depends on who gets the most support.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He eased into his seat. &#34;I didn&#39;t plan on doing a lot of talking. What I&#39;m offering is quite simple. Work with me. Let&#39;s build an alliance together-our own very world where we&#39;ll all be equal. You&#39;ve never really had a place here. And at the end of the day when this war ends, you&#39;ll definitely be on the losing side. Unless you&#39;re with me, in our new world.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>LYRIC I sniffled as I wiped my nose with the back of my hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The night was cold,the weather stormy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I missed my freedom. I&#39;d have been in bed, probably with Jaris, enjoying the weather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wished I wasn&#39;t running. I wished my life was different from this. I wished...I was with my kids and my family was complete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Someone whistled behind me. I wiped my face as I stood from the floor where I&#39;d been sitting, going to meet the shop owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m about to lock up. Here.&#34; He handed me my phone. &#34;It&#39;s charged.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you.&#34; I wasn&#39;t even sure he could hear me, my voice too weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>i stared at the screen as I returned to sit on the floor beside the shop. The corner was dark and quiet,keeping me protected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After escaping Caden&#39;s place, I realized I didn&#39;t even have any means to travel to the Capital City. All I was able to take with me from Caden&#39;s place was my phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And even if I managed to get some cash for the trip, how could I possibly make it there without getting caught? It was impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t just sit back and not tell someone about this. I was too angry at Marta to keep shut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,I dialed her line, unable to resist the urge to let her know she&#39;d been caught and I was coming to get my kids, one way or the other. I wanted her to not be able to fall asleep tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hid my number while calling. Fortunately, she answered the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes? Who&#39;s this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My lower lip spasmed as I heard her voice. Marta Monroe. The girl living a perfect life with my kids while l was out here running.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s Lyric.&#34; I could feel her shock the moment I said my name.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I hope you haven&#39;t suddenly lost your tongue,&#34;I added when she kept mute for too long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; her voice sounded a bit scratchy. &#34;Wh-Why are you calling me? What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard her move. &#34;If I were you, l&#39;d gladly turn myself in. You can&#39;t keep running, Lyric. We both know one way or the other, they&#39;ll definitely find you someday.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really? And how long do you think it&#39;ll take me to tell everyone your dirty little secret? You know, about the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lapsed into total silence. I imagined her face palling, her eyes dilating, and her feet probably wobbling.I wished she&#39;d get to feel worse than this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You took my kids, Marta. To make it worse, you tried to keep me away from them. You told them I was a witch and made them hate me. How could you!? How could one person be so evil? So...so vile?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric...&#34; There was a crack in her voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you even buy kids like they&#39;re some sort of commodities? Not because you wanted them, but because you wanted to trap a man to do your bidding? How could you be so selfish?&#34;O</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,calm down-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, you tried to kill Penelope because you didn&#39;t want her telling the truth? Really? Why didn&#39;t you kill me as well, huh? Or did you feel you wouldn&#39;t have been able to deal with the guilt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know what? I&#39;m coming for them. And I&#39;m coming for you. I&#39;ll tell everyone what you&#39;ve done and take my kids far away from you,you monster!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric, you can&#39;t do that. You need to listen to me!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Listen to you about what?!&#34; I yelled so hard I was sure the shop owner heard. &#34;What lies could you possibly fabricate on this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You can&#39;t tell Jaris about this,&#34; she breathed heavily. &#34;Believe me, he wouldn&#39;t want to know about Xyla.&#34; I scoffed, my brows crinkling. &#34;What about Xyla? That she&#39;s his daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No! Listen,&#34; shesighed. &#34;Xyla is a Siphon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mental alarm triggered inside me as a chill settled over my bone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know you wouldn&#39;t want to believe this, but guess who it was that killed the Luna to save you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was it. I lost my mind.</p>
