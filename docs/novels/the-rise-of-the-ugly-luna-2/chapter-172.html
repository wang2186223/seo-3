                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Because she lost her memories that night.&#34; This time it was Cora who answered. My gaze snapped to hers.&#34;It&#39;s a miracle my sister&#39;s actually alive today.Someone tried to kill her. She was shot and fell into the river. Fortunately, some fishermen found her. And when she regained consciousness, I was the only one she remembered.&#34; 1</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s the reason I was reluctant about letting anyone in.We&#39;re scared those people might be after her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What exactly does she remember?&#34; Jace asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not much. The memories are a blur and are majorly from her teenagehood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No.&#34; I covered mny face with my palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But the doctors said they&#39;d be back in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t have that time.&#34;I shifted my teary gaze to Penelope. &#34;You may not remember, but you took my kids from me. I met you when I was pregnant and thought you were helping me. Instead, you deceived me and took them when they were born, then had the nurses lie to me that they were dead. For six years, I&#39;ve had to live in torment, thinking my kids were really dead. But you just gave them away! That night, you called to tell me they were alive before whatever happened to you. So,you better remember as fast as you can, because I&#39;ve been waiting for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jace&#39;s hands came on my shoulders. &#34;It&#39;s fine,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No, it&#39;s not! She&#39;s a terrible, heartless bitch who doesn&#39;t even feel a thing for kids. Because tell me why the hell she&#39;d do this to me when I trusted her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, that&#39;s enough!&#34; Cora lashed out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be enough when I find my kids!&#34; I shot her a venomous stare. Right now, I was barely able to restrain myself from going over to meet Penelope and dragging my nails down her face. The Penelope in question looked guilt-stricken, tears hovering at the brink of her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I actually wished she&#39;d feel more than guilt.I wished she&#39;d feel real pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, for your own good, you better pray my kids have been living well. I hope you gave them to a nice family. Because, believe me, if they&#39;ve been suffering, I&#39;ll make sure you suffer too, Penelope.&#34; &#34;Stop this madness!&#34; Cora yelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look, I understand how you feel, okay? I&#39;d also be mad if my kids got taken from me. But you need to remember that my sister is still in recovery. As soon as she has anything, I promise I&#39;ll let you know. You have my word on it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh tears spilled down my cheeks. Of all the horrible things that could&#39;ve happened to her, why did it have to be memory loss?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept glaring at her while Jace exchanged contacts with Cora.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; she suddenly muttered, tears running down her cheeks. &#34;I don&#39;t know why I did what I did,but I&#39;ll do anything to help you find your kids. I&#39;ll-I&#39;ll think really hard tonight and try to come up with someting as soon as I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My look at her didn&#39;t lose its intensity. &#34;Yeah. You better do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out of the house with Jace who kept assuring words to me, telling me we&#39;d definitely find the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was seeing me off to my car when I suddenly froze and winced, my hand flying to my midriff. &#34;Hey!&#34; Jace quickly held me. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It took me a moment to straighten up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m fine. Just cramps.&#34; Which was strange, because l never really had period cramps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the car, I was so relieved when I found Jaris still there. Jace greeted him before departing,while l proceeded into the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still won&#39;t tell he who you went to see?&#34; Jaris asked as he started the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s personal. Please, promise me you&#39;ll keep to your words and not get involved?&#34; I let him see the plea in my eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t reply and started driving</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris?&#34; There was a slight fear in my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I felt better when he replied, &#34;I don&#39;t break my promise,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****十＊＊＊＊</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent a whole week with Jaris in the cabin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was crazy and amazing how close and comfortable we became with each other. Jaris wanted me around at all times. It was a bit disturbing, but there was a part of me that liked it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only had two attacks which were controlled the moment I cuddled him. If I didn&#39;t have my siphoning powers to help him in cases like this, I sincerely feared what would&#39;ve become of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The final trial was in four days. We had to return to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So far, Jaris was trying his best to fight the urges. So,I think he&#39;d be good to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were a lot of people there to welcome us when we reached Darkspire. They didn&#39;t even know where he had been, but the thought of their Alpha being away for days was something to be joyous about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While we were making our way in, I spotted Jace staring at Kael. But the cold Beta won&#39;t even look at him. He made it seem like Jace didn&#39;t exist to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hurt I saw in my best friend&#39;s eyes broke my heart.I wished things didn&#39;t get this bad between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a bath, had something to eat and slept off as soon as I finished eating. I couldn&#39;t understand how dizzy I was. The urge to just lay in bed and close my eyes was overwhelming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t know how long I was out, but I opened my eyes the moment I felt a presence in the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was seated on the edge of the bed, his hand caressing my hair as he watched me sleep. The dimness of the room told me it was evening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re here,&#34; I muttered, my voice still heavy with sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a certain sadness in his eyes as he held my stare. The sight was hard to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments passed before he finally said something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can do it, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meaning didn&#39;t register.&#34;Do what?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Compete in the last trial. Become King. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s meant for me anymore.&#34;</p>
