                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hand tightened around the steering as my throat became as dry as dust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was he doing here? With her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Coming out of the hospital were Jaris and Marta.They were having a conversation and right there,they looked like a normal couple.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shouldn&#39;t feel this way, considering the fact that the woman had kids for him, but it served as a constant reminder that he had someone in his life already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His beta-Kael came out shortly, holding Xylon and Xyla&#39;s hands. It became clear that they must&#39;ve brought Xylon in for a checkup or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart sank even further. The kids were so adorable, but at that moment, I couldn&#39;t help not seethem all as one happy family. It was also a reminder of Jaris&#39; betrayal five years ago. He made me think I was special when he had a pregnant lover at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, a thought occurred to me. What if Marta was occupied with something and couldn&#39;t be Jaris&#39;Luna right now? That would explain why they only needed me for a year. With me gone, Marta would take over.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was that what I was? A mere replacement?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought stung. Even after becoming so pretty,I was still being used, wasn&#39;tl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As I watched them get into the backseat of their car,I was angry enough to shed a tear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;See? He looks fine today. I am telling you, Jaris,there&#39;s no need for that woman to come near my kids,&#34; Marta said as soon as we were in the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched the back of my nape, exhausted already.&#34;Please, Marta, don&#39;t be so daft. We&#39;ve known Xylon well enough to know it&#39;s only temporary. He might have another crisis today. What&#39;re you going to do about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And I will take care of him like I&#39;ve been doing for the past three years. I&#39;m one of the head doctors in TCH,Jaris.I can do this!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, your best has not exactly helped him in three years.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta&#39;s jaw dropped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I really can&#39;t understand why you have anissue with this. You should be glad we&#39;ve finally found someone that can help Xylon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She won&#39;t be able to,&#34; Marta&#39;s eyes glistened with under tears. &#34;If I can&#39;t do it, believe me when I say nobody else can. I have tried my best, Jaris.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yet, she was able to do something you haven&#39;t been able to do in years in mere minutes. Do you see the difference now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s possible there was something fishy about what she did that day.I&#39;m-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Marta, if you&#39;re gonna keep talking about this, then I&#39;d suggest you get out of the car.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, that was enough to shut her up, but she looked like she was going to cry any minute. Unfortunately,that was her problem, not mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>****+****+</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had so much planned on what to do once I got to the Pack. But one of them was not getting a visit from some representatives from the Alpha King&#39;s palace,bearing news.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The throne of the Alpha King ruled over every other.One did not get visits from representatives unless the matter was dire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They were waiting in the conference room with the elders of my Pack, and Nerion informed me as soon as I arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I couldn&#39;t get you on the phone. So, I decided to wait for your return. They&#39;ve been waiting patiently,&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>he supplied as he led me to the conference room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did they say anything about why they&#39;re here?&#34;I asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They wouldn&#39;t. Whatever they came with seems to be confidential, and they only want it delivered to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I hated being curious. The Alpha King-King Thaddeus-and I have been on very good terms. Just a week ago, we were on a phone call for half an hour.There was no way he&#39;d bring trouble to my Pack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We finally reached the conference hall and the men who had been sitting rose to their feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alpha Jaris,&#34; One of them called. The rest acknowledged with a nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their faces were not looking good at all. Something was terribly wrong.</p>
