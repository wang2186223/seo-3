                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to protest and only then did I realize my tongue had gotten too weak to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought the phone behind me and lifted my finger to the fingerprint sensor, unlocking it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched helplessly as he scrolled through the phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm. A. Jaris, with a love emoji,&#34; he pronounced Jaris&#39; name the way I saved it. &#34;Is he aware you saved his name with a loveemoji?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t...&#34; I tried to tell him, but I wasn&#39;t even sure he could hear me, my voice being too weak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a smug smile as he went ahead with the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十＋＊＊＊＊</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had a long stressful meeting with the Elders. They were very worried about Caden and wanted to know how to deal with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I told them to leave him to me. If there was someone Caden wanted revenge against, it was me. All the attacks him and the Feeders have been doing lately was an act to get my attention.I knew it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time we finished the meeting, it was too late to fly back to Darkspire. Moreover, I was exhausted and just wanted some sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luca walked with me as I headed towvard my car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden showing up now when you&#39;re so close to claiming the throne is really making me worried. Why hasn&#39;t he tried to contact you yet or something?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I already told you in there, Luca. I don&#39;t know.&#34; But I was sure he&#39;d contact me soon. He&#39;d made enough threats already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;To be honest, I wwish he was gone for good,&#34; Luca said without remorse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My phone rang in my pocket. When I discovered it was Lyric, I answered without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Not her. It&#39;s me,brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My feet came to a stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart, for the first time ever, skipped a beat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It came crashing on me-the final thing he needed to do to get my attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden.He had Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How have you been, J? I&#39;d be hurt if you told me you didn&#39;t miss me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something burnt at the back of my throat.I couldn&#39;t quite tell what it was? Shock? Fear?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not fear of him, but what must&#39;ve happened to Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time I was having these emotions. I didn&#39;t even know what to do with them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Luca asked, creasing by brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was it that noticeable?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked away, going to a spot I knew l&#39;d have some privacy. Luca knew better than to follow me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Seemns you don&#39;t wanna talk to me. Maybe you&#39;d want to talk to her. Say hi, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her scream was the response I got. I didn&#39;t think it was possible before now, but my blood became heated ash. While fire sizzled in my veins, my skin radiated a chilling frost. She cries beautifully, Jaris. I bet she sings better in bed.&#34; She stopped screaming,but I could still hear her whimpers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden.&#34; I&#39;d never called the name with more malice before. &#34;What&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing. Just catching up with my brother&#39;s mate. I&#39;m actually glad I got to meet her. Lyric is quite beautiful. How did you get so lucky, Jaris?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I should&#39;ve known. Damn it, I should&#39;ve fucking known he&#39;d go for someone important.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a persistent pounding in my skull, making everything worse. I was staring into space, yet all I could see was Lyric in pain, being hurt repeatedly by my brother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>l imagined her afraid and helpless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did it seem like I was struggling with breath?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let her go.&#34; My voice was the iciest it&#39;d ever been. Yet, I knew it would have no impact on Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, I will. When I&#39;m done with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Caden!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What, brother? Are you afraid she&#39;ll break? Trust me, she&#39;s already broken.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t doubt that. Caden was a psychopathic bastard. My brain refused to imagine the horrible things he must&#39;ve done to Lyric.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.I&#39;d run mad if I dare imagine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;This is between us,&#34; my voice was frostier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah,I know. But I kinda like her in the middle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another scream from Lyric, followed by her begging him to stop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. No. No.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What the fuck do you want?!&#34; I yelled, my lungs burning</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, Caden. If he&#39;d called me under a different circumstance, the Moon knew I&#39;d have been ready to handle his madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>1&#39;d actually been ready since I learned he escaped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden might be a problem to others but not me. He and I, we were alike in so many ways. And the last thing I&#39;d ever be is to be afraid of him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t act the way I&#39;d planned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not when he was hurting Lyric. Not when her cries were making me go insane.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was dying inside. And I didn&#39;t even understand how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ll be seeing her soon, Jaris. I&#39;m sure you have enough time on your hands because she&#39;ll be needing a lot of attention. Then, you and I, we&#39;re gonna talk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt cold liquid on my palm. I opened it and noticed my nails had bitten onto it so hard from fisting that it was bleeding already.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll kill you.&#34; I gritted the words. &#34;I&#39;ll find you, Caden. And I&#39;ll kill you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Will you?&#34; I imagined him smirking. &#34;I guess we&#39;ll know when we see. Goodnight, brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The call went dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother calling again &#39;cause I knew he would&#39;ve switched off the phone. The son of a bitch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I called Nerion even as I made my way to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call Razi. Tell him to get the jet ready.&#34; Razi was the pilot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I thought we were sleeping over? I already told Razi to-&#34; &#34;If Razi is not at the airport by the time we arrive, two people will be dead. You and him.&#34;</p>
