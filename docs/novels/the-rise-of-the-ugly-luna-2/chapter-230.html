                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the following morning, Marta brought the kids to the location I asked. It was in a busy amusement park.Here, I could easily get away in case she betrayed me and brought the Executioners. Although, I doubt she&#39;d take such risks when she knows I could easily expose herto everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart leapt for joy as I watched her entering into the park with the kids. They hadn&#39;t seen me yet,so l took the opportunity to admire my two beautiful creations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe they were both mine. I suddenly felt lucky, so so lucky to be their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They finally saw me and I felt the warmth of the happiness that illuminated their faces.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty Lyric!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stopped walking and ran. I kept my arms ready for them to jump in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their excitement was contagious. Goodness, I couldn&#39;t believe the kids were the ones looking so happy to see me. It was only a few weeks ago when they called me a witch and didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, pumpkins. How have you been?&#34; I stroked Xyla&#39;s hair with one hand while I ruffled Xylon&#39;s hair with the other.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;ve been fine, Aunty. We missed you. How have you been?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been...well, good.&#34; Of course, l&#39;ve been anything but good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xyla lowered her eyes as she suddenly looked guilty. She nervously fiddled wvith her nails.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry...for getting you in trouble. I didn&#39;t know Grandma was going to get badly hurt. I didn&#39;t mean to put you in trouble. I was just... angy when I saw her hurting you and wanted her to stop. I didn&#39;t mean to-&#34; &#34;Hey, it&#39;s okay,&#34; I pulled her inte a small hug. &#34;Nobody&#39;s blaming you for anything, Xyla. Don&#39;t even think about it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that I gave it a thought, how had she been able to cope with the memory of killing her own grandmother? Has she been fine?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, one thing was for sure: my daughter was one hell of a strong woman-like her father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I wanted to tell daddy and save you,&#34; she whispered against my waist. &#34;But mummy told me it was a bad idea and was only going to get Daddy more hurt. I&#39;m sorry, Aunt Lyric. I&#39;m sorry I stayed quiet and said nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw a stare at Marta who was staring back at me, looking a bit uncomfortable. Oh, typical Marta. Always ready to throw me under the bus for her own benefit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s fine, honey, you did the right thing.&#34; I pulled Xyla from my waist and gently stroked her hair. &#34;Daddy doesn&#39;t need to know what you did. Besides, if itwasn&#39;t for me, you wouldn&#39;t have done it. So, don&#39;t blame yourself in any way okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I touched Xylon&#39;s jaw. &#34;And you, young man. How have you been?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve been good.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His speech was clearer. It was relieving to know he was becoming more outspoken. Though from the look of things, Xylon was going to be a very cold man in the future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With them on either side of me, I threw my hands around their shoulders and led them toward the game centers. &#34;Wanna play some games with me like old times?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>····</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My day was beyond fulfilled. I spent a long time with the kids, played until I was breathless and didn&#39;t have any more energy. The whole time, I completely ignored Marta who kept watching from a distance with a scowl on her face.I was actually happy she was here to see this; to see the motherly connection she was never going to have with the kids she took from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wish I could continue being in their lives and watch them grow. It was quite unfortunate that Fate has cruel plans for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got them ice cream and went on to speak with Marta while they busied themselves on a bench.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You need to wrap it up, Lyric. We have to get moving. You might be far from the Capital City, but someone could also recognize you here,&#34; Marta said as soon as I reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Calm down, will you? I&#39;m done with them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She crossed her arms and looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not giving you my blessings to be their mother, Marta. Someone like you doesn&#39;t deserve to be a mother,not unless you change. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have a choice right now. So, I&#39;m telling you now to take good care of my kids. I know you only see people as tools and commodities, but my kids are different. Don&#39;t ever hurt them. Don&#39;t ever put them in a difficult position to achieve one of your sick aims. And more importantly,&#34; I stepped closer to her. &#34;Don&#39;t ever try to utilize Xyla&#39;s powers. I already hate that she&#39;s a Siphon. I&#39;d hate more for her to become your gadget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you, Marta, and if I ever get to know you&#39;ve been using Xyla, I&#39;ll damn all consequences and take her from you. I&#39;m sure you understand what I mean.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes burned with irritation. &#34;Can you stop with the lecture? They&#39;re also my kids. I know you birthed them, but I took care of them from infanthood you know? So, don&#39;t think I actually hate them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, you never hate someone as long as they&#39;re useful to you,&#34; I chuckled. &#34;Mischievous Marta. Always doing the wrong things.&#34; I tsked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunt Lyric!&#34; Xyla called as she and her brother scuttled toward me. &#34;We&#39;re done with the ice cream.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I spent more time with them before we finally parted ways. It was the hardest thing to do. The poor kids didn&#39;t even know this was likely going to be the last time we saw each other; at least for a long time. They didn&#39;t know how heartbreaking this moment was for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even at that, they were still reluctant to leave with Marta and asked when they&#39;d come visit again. I promised them I&#39;d make out time, but for the first time, I knew l made a promise l&#39;d not be able to keep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was finally ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The number Caden had stored in my phone hadn&#39;t been going through. We tried calling severally during the last two weeks but couldn&#39;t reach him. I even sent multiple texts, begging him to release Jaris, but he didn&#39;t respond.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I texted him again today, telling him what I knew he&#39;d been waiting to hear. I told him I was ready to sign the contract and asked where I was meant to meet him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His response didn&#39;t come until hours later, at night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave me an address to go to and added a warning beneath it:&#34;come alone, Lyric. If you&#39;re just trying to play with me, you&#39;ll never see Jaris again. No one will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The threat was enough to raise goosebumps on my skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got my things ready and left the cottage.</p>
