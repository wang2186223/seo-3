                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Chairman went over the rules with the Alphas.Each of them would be taken to separate rooms where they&#39;d be given a heavy task to do in display of their strengths. The trial was to last for seventy minutes. Gasps rippled through the crowd when he mentioned that. Seventy minutes was a whole lot of time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He mentioned that they could give up when they got tired, but they would be the end of the trial for them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just hearing about it alone was already making me tired. How were they supposed to hold on for that long?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t help being worried for Jaris. The trial began. The four Alphas were led to separate rooms at the same time and we could see it all on camera.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth hung open when I saw the task.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood in the center of the room with their arms spread apart. Then, a chain was locked around their arms, all the way to their shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following the instructions, they pulled, and something pulled from the roof. A big statue-the biggest I&#39;d ever seen. It looked like it&#39;d have the weight of three cars.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was hanging from the roof, connected to the chains. So, as the Alphas pulled, its weight moved from the ceiling and rested on them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crowd murmured when they realized this was what they were meant to carry for seventy minutes.My heart raced in alarm when I noticed the pain and surprise on the Alpha&#39;s faces. It only meant it was damn heavy and even they didn&#39;t expect the triaI to be like this. There were four Alphas on the screen, yet the only one I focused on was Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart drummed against my ribcage as I took in his features. The trial was just starting. Was he tired already? What if he decides to give up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock kept ticking. The atmosphere in the air was tense.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Twenty minutes into the time, one of the Alphas asked for his chain to be released, accepting defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall went a little noisy as people from his Pack grumbled about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My anxiety spiked to a whole new level. It was just twenty minutes and someone was already giving up.How would the rest of them make it to seventy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at the faces of the remaining Alphas to see if they were tired. The other Alpha seemed like he was using all of his last strength to keep pulling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek was sweaty and had veins popping on his neck and forehead from how hard he pulled. Well, I didn&#39;t care about him. He could fail if he wanted to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I returned my gaze to Jaris, I felt an ache in my heart. He seemed to be holding just fine. But for how long? They still had forty-five minutes to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fifty minutes into the trial and someone else gave up.But it was neither Jaris nor Zarek. It was the third Alpha.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The hall became noisy again as people grumbled about it. But I didn&#39;t look away from the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was just Jaris and Zarek left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What if they both failed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I already knew the answer to that. A fresh trial would have to be organized; a more difficult one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept checking the time. Just a few more minutes...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, Jaris, hold on. Hold on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zarek moved. The gasps that rippled through the hal were nothing like I&#39;d heard before. Well, the competition was between the two now, so everyone&#39;s curiosity was piqued.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We all thought he was about to give up, considering how his legs were shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head back. We couldn&#39;t hear him, but we were sure he was grunting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked like he was so close to giving up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the time. Fifteen more minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock kept ticking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ten more minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A fresh gasp rippled through the hall when Zarek made another move as if his knees were about to give up. For a moment, I actually became scared for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why doesn&#39;t he just give up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, something dawned on me. My belly got filled with butterflies at the realization that in all of this, Jaris remained unmoving. He was the only one who hadn&#39;t shown any sign of exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart quickened at the thought. How was he so strong?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Few more minutes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bell went off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cheers erupted from every corner of the hall as we all looked at our two winners on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the people celebrated, the chains were pulled off of them with people rushing over with towels and water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clapped so hard and only stopped to wipe the tears that were making their way down my cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe it. Jaris won! In a grand way!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He made it to the final round, and with this, there was a high chance of him becoming the Alpha King! The King of every other Alpha!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gods, I was so happy for him!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, they emerged on stage and were given their lanyards.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Jaris approached his seat, I was so tempted to run up to him and give him a tight hug. In that moment, I felt proud being his. Well, not really &#39;his,&#39;but at least I was his mate and everyone saw me that way. He was mine in the eyes of the people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Congratulations, Alpha Jaris. That was spectacular!&#34; I beamed as he took his seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cocked his brow at me. &#34;You look so happy, I&#39;m starting to think you&#39;re the one who will be crowned King.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I leaned back and howled with laughter until my abdomen hurt. Jaris could be annoying most of the time, but he could be really cute and funny when he wanted to be. I liked this part of him.</p>
