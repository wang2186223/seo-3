                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was onto me before the scream could fully form, his hand pressing heavily on my mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I fought with all I had-my legs, my entire body. I thrashed against him, still trying to scream and wriggle out of his hold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was too strong. He wouldn&#39;t let me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not here to hurt you, but if you keep struggling, you&#39;ll make me do it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>. I stopped, majorly because my body was already growing tired from struggling with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;l take mny hand off now. But you can&#39;t scream, Lyric. You wouldn&#39;t want to know what would happen if you do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| swallowed tersely around the lump that had long formed in my throat. How the hell did he get into Darkspire and into this diner?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slowly, he pulled his hand away, but I was too scared to attempt streaming again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My body quivered as I shrank backward, wanting to get away from him. Expect the sink was right behind me, and he was just in front of me. There was nowhere for me to go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, let me go.&#34; The sight of him was already bringing back memories I&#39;d been trying so hard to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that I was complying, he looked more relaxed. He crossed his arms as he leaned against the wal behind him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wow,&#34; his eyes went from my head to toe. &#34;You look stunning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted to the door. I wished someone would show up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been on my mind, Lyric.&#34; He lifted his hand to my hair. I thought he was about to hit me, so l</p>
                
                
                
                <p>flinched. But he only wrapped some strands of hair around his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;For two weeks. I&#39;ve not been able to stop thinking about you, and it&#39;s been crazy. You know,&#34; he lowNered his hand from my hair, crisscrossing them again. &#34;When I abducted you, I only wanted to hurt you. So, tell me why I&#39;ve been unable to stop thinking about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was too scared to even understand what he was saying. I could hear him talking, but his words were barely registering, my mind too focused on getting the hell.out of here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought his hand to my lips, and this time, I pushed it off without thinking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop touching me!&#34; My rib cage was a rollercoaster, climbing high and plunging deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought his hand again, so calmly like I hadn&#39;t just slapped it away. I tried to do the same thing, but his other hand grabbed mine, a silent warning passing through his eyes, telling me not to oppose him any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he was sure I wouldn&#39;t fight him anymore, he released my hand. &#34;Red looks good on you.&#34; He pressed my bottom lip between his thumb and index finger. &#34;Did Jaris ask you to wear it for him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked at him, perplexed.How did he know?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled when he noticed my confusion. &#34;So, he did ask you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ran his thumb across the seam of my lips. &#34;Red lips are his favorite. He fell in love with them when Etta,his first girlfriend always wore it on. It was her favorite.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My brows knitted in confusion, struggling with the dread in my stomach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When she died, he had his next girlfriends always put on red.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Etta was dead? So... Jaris loved red lips because it reminded him of a dead girl?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden dropped his hand from my lips. &#34;Did I mention he was actually the one that killed her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The monster laughed at my shock. &#34;Looks like you&#39;ve been in the dark about a lot of things, Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. He was trying to mess with my head, and I&#39;d be a fool to let him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re not safe with someone like Jaris, you know? Especially not now, after my little gift to him tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My confusion only got worse. &#34;Wh-What&#39;re you talking about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smirked. &#34;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes darted to the door again. &#34;Please, let me go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand came to my hair again, caressing my edges. &#34;Do you have an answer yet? As to why I keep thinking about you? Every night before I go to sleep, every morning when I wake up. And even when I&#39;m supposed to be working during the day. Your&#39;face comes into view, distracting me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed his hand away despite how scared I was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stop touching me. I don&#39;t want you here. Please, let me go!&#34; I whimpered, my panic level rising.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so scared that the next minute, his claws might be descending on me. I couldn&#39;t aford to go through the same pain he put me through three weeks ago. I hated him and would do anything to watch him suffer.But for now, I wanted to be away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric,&#34; he called my name softly, his hand coming to my jaw. Why wouldn&#39;t he just stop touching me for crying out loud?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such beauty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He finally took some steps back, &#34;We&#39;ll see each other again. Pretty soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with crushing relief as he walked out the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I turned around and gripped the sink to stop myself from falling. I still tried so hard to hold back the tears.I couldn&#39;t cry because of him. No, I couldn&#39;t let him win.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaving the restroom and returning to my space with Jaris, my body was shaking uncontrollably.I rubbed my hands against my arm, still having this fear of the monster being around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris stopped eating as soon as he saw me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey,you okay?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t say a word and clumsily took my seat. The fear was so deep-rooted in me, it was killing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric!&#34; Jaris called more urgently.&#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I guess it was that obvious that I looked shaken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;J-1 saw him.&#34; I looked around the diner, like he could be hanging around or something.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris didn&#39;t ask who I was referring to. He didn&#39;t need to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sprang to his feet immediately, reaching for his phone and running toward the back of the diner.</p>
