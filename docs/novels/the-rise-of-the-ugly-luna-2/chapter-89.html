                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Things were not fine. The aftermath of the situation was exactly why l&#39;d been scared of revealing the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the previous day after the samples were taken,Jaris hadn&#39;t been home. What bothered me the most was the fact that the twins were very sad and worried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They didn&#39;t exactly know what the problem was, but they knew their father was mad about something and hadn&#39;t been home because of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty, do you think daddy will come home today?&#34;Xyla asked, lifting her head from her drawing book to look at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I stuttered for words. &#34;He&#39;s not taking our calls. And we were supposed to show him some pictures,&#34; she made a pout.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon nodded, showing his agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart clenched painfully. Jaris hadn&#39;t been taking their calls? Was that necessary?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This-This was exactly what I feared. The whole thing affecting the kids. I was scared Jaris would stop loving these kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s jau very busy. Daddy will be home, okay?&#34; I ruffled their hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Xylon took up his writing tab, and after a few seconds, showed me what he wrote on it. &#34;Can you take us to him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you know where he is?&#34; Xyla asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mouth opened and closed for sometime, unable to come up with a response.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I uh...I don&#39;t really know if-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, aunty. We&#39;re worried about him.&#34; &#34;I&#39;m sorry, honey, but I don&#39;t know where he is.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kids exchanged glances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We think we might do,&#34; Xyla whispered. &#34;Daddy has a private vacation home. We think that&#39;s where he goes to when he&#39;s mad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;B-But we don&#39;t know where it is,&#34;. Xylon spoke with difficulty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against my will, I found myself asking around for Jaris&#39; vacation home. I was actually scared of what his reaction might be if I showed up with his kids, but I think he was wrong for ignoring them. They didn&#39;t have a hand in any of these. He shouldn&#39;t let them suffer for the mistakes of their mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to contact Kael to get the truth. He was reluctant, of course. Then I reminded him of when I helped him with Jace and made him understand he owed me a favour. Turned our the guy was more reasonable than I thought.Although he did warn me never to mention to Jaris that I got the info from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wore a simple pair of jeans and a black top. Just before I left the room, I slipped the scan out of my drawer to look at it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A longing smile painted my lips as I traced the edges with my fingers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My babies. Our babies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perhaps, if they were alive, things would be different for Jaris. Maybe he wouldn&#39;t feel much like a loser.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tucked the picture back into my drawer before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta wasn&#39;t home-she hadn&#39;t been since morning and nobody knew where she was. So, I couldn&#39;t tell her I was taking the kids to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hopefully,the nanny would when she asks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was about two hours drive to get to the location Kael had given me.The place was so quiet and private, with numerous flowers and trees decorating the pathway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When we reached the gate, the securities fortunately let us in after recognizing the kids and me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I drove through for a couple of minutes before I reached the main house. The mansion,actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took out a moment to admire the beauty of the place. It was beyond stunning! Who would&#39;ve known that Jaris had something like that just wasting around as a vacation home?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exited the car with the kids, my eyes still darting around the place. There were four cars in thelot,cars that weren&#39;t in Darkspire. So, obviously,aside the numerous cars in Darkspire, he had extra ones just waiting here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the corner of the compound was a huge waterfall,the a coming out of the mouth of a built-up wolf.It was magnificent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mansion looked like a vacation home indeed, because it looked so peaceful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding the kids&#39; hands, I walked to the front door and knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman in an apron opened up almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good evening, ma&#39;am.&#34; She dipped her head. Her eyes beamed when she saw the kids. &#34;Xyla! Xylon!How&#39;re you,dearests?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re fine Ms. Reyes,&#34; Xyla answered while Xylon nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is Alpha Jaris in?&#34; I brought the woman&#39;s attention back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh. Yes, he-does he know you&#39;re coming?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she asked, I noticed a movement behind her.Then,Jaris appeared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stood behind the woman, his impressive height towering over her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d do anything to see the expression on my face.I&#39;d bet I looked like a child drooling at her favorite snack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Alpha was wearing simple black pants with a black turtleneck top. His hands were casually slipped into his pockets, and if it wasn&#39;t the most simple,yet charming sight I&#39;d seen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to shut them out-the memories-but failed woefully. They hit me like a storm, filling my every senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt his lips on mine, his hands all over my body, his sweet scent, his moans.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cleared my throat and dragged my eyes to the floor.What was wrong with me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Daddy!&#34; Xyla and Xylon chorused as they ran to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman had stepped out of the way, giving them access to the grumpy-looking Alpha. To my relief, he welcomed them with a bright look.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thank goodness. I&#39;d been scared he&#39;d push them off or something. &#34;Hey. How&#39;re you doing?&#34; He dropped to a crouch,tousling their hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;We&#39;re fine, daddy. We were worried about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He smiled and straightened up. &#34;Why don&#39;t you go with Mrs. Reyes? She&#39;ll give you some milk in the kitchen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he looked at me, his eyes were hard. &#34;With me,Lyric.&#34;</p>
