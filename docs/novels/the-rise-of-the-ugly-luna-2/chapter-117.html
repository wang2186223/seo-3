                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The aftermath of meeting with Penelope turned out to be torturous. I was restless and couldn&#39;t even eat when I got back to Darkspire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept shuffling between holding the scan and touching the necklace. I needed something to keep me close to them. It was pure torture having this mental knowledge of losing them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sometime, when I concluded | needed a distraction to avoid losing my mind, I took the pills.Might not be my smartest move; I know I promised never to take them again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I couldn&#39;t help it. I needed something to help me feel better. And only my dreams could help me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right after I took it, my dream did come.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris made me love me in the way I liked and always enjoyed it. I screamed so hard as I came, and for a moment, I wished this dream could last forever.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And my week just kept getting worse. In the morning, I woke up to an email from TCH,telling me I had been summoned by the board by ten a.m.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what it meant. They were about to penalize me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My hands wouldn&#39;t stop shaking the minute I saw the email. All my efforts at TCH, my passion for saving lives...it was all about to go down the drain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was crying when the kids came to visit. As soon as l realized they were the ones knocking, I dried my face completely before getting the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their happy mood put me out of my sad one partially.And I was even more glad when I discovered they were there to ask for my opinion on which jewel they were to use on their birthday.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ugh. Talk about their birthday. My gifts for them were already being shipped and I couldn&#39;t wait for them to see them.The party was in a week&#39;s time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When I was done making a decision for them, they ran off to get ready for school.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for me, I got ready to go to TCH.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was having a hard time keeping my composure on as I got ready in front of the mnirror. Real fear gripped me. It was 09:05 when I took my bag and left the room</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To my surprise, Jaris was out there, just approaching my door. Or, at least I thought he was approaching my door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good morning, Alpha Jaris.&#34; I dipped my head as he stopped in front of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His masculine cologne hit me in an instant. Cedar Noir and Dark Truffle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric. You ready?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I furrowed my brows. Ready for what?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I um... I&#39;m going to TCH. I was summoned this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I know. That&#39;s why I asked if you were ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh. &#34;Y-Yeah,I am.&#34; Ready and utterly terrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good. Let&#39;s go, then.&#34; He started walking ahead of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wait,what? What was he doing?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You coming with me?&#34; I hadn&#39;t moved from where I stood. &#34;Looks like it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the much distance he&#39;d created between us,I had to force my legs to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But why? I mean, you don&#39;t have to.&#34; The words came out a little breathy since I was struggling to meet up with his pace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I know. But I want to.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His answers were so clipped, making me feel like I was bothering him. But I couldn&#39;t shake off the warmth that spread through my belly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What had gotten into the stone-hearted Alpha? Why would he want to accompany me to TCH?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you,&#34; I mentioned while sliding next to him in the backseat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was busy on his laptop but glanced at me and nodded. No words. He just returned his gaze to his laptop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride to TCH was torturously long. I was both curious to know what my judgement would be and also scared of facing the board.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Either way, I had a feeling today would not be a good day for me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched my purse tight as myself, Jaris and Kael made our way into her ground floor of TCH. It was impossible not to notice the glares people threw my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I could even hear the words they said in their minds:&#34;Killer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careless doctor.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s not fit to be here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I imagined them saying even worse. But I didn&#39;t deserve them. There was no way I&#39;d been so careless with my application.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The walk to the elevator felt like forever, and when the three of us were finally in, I released a very deep breath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;ll be fine, Lyric. You keep going this way and you might pass out before they even penalize you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stone-hearted grumpy Jaris. He was comforting me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Goodness,the surreality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I exhaled deeply before nodding at him. &#34;Thank you.&#34; A couple minutes more and we both entered the board room. Kael remained at the door while Jaris and I proceeded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The large room, filledwith a long table and plenty of chairs, was already filled. I saw the grumpy faces of men I hadn&#39;t seen before. Men who were, no doubt,top superiors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They stood up and bowed as soon as they saw Jaris.It wasn&#39;t until he took a seat that they did the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Jaris wasn&#39;t supposed to be here. This was a business of the organization,and non-staff weren&#39;t allowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I guessed it didn&#39;t matter when you were someone like Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting kicked off. I avoided looking at the faces of the doctors I knew as I hated seeing the disappointment in them. Most of them had faith in me.They believed I was good, but now, it looked like l failed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions were thrown at me, all of which I tried my best to answer without shaking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It went on for a long time, and next was the President reading the book of rules to me. That was where it got worse for me. Where I knew my doom was close. &#34;As much as you&#39;ve been an amazing doctor, Dr.Lyric,this particular case cannot be simply overlooked,&#34; The President started his penalty speech. &#34;Four of our patients are dead due to your carelessness. Aside the pain that comes with losing them, this is also a bad name to the hospital. Believe me, TCH wouldn&#39;t have its name and respect if such cases occurred frequently.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, Lyric. Don&#39;t cry. Don&#39;t cry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I could feel the stupid tears building behind my eyes again. With the way the speech was going, I knew I was going to get fired.</p>
