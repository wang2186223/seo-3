                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, my goodness!&#34; Bianca gasped beside me, clearly seeing him too. &#34;How is he here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My mind scrambled for words that wouldn&#39;t form. I felt completely numb, the reality that I&#39;d been away from him hitting me so hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time I wasseeing him in six months.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until his eyes ran into mine that I could breathe again. There was no instant reaction on his face;as if he couldn&#39;t understand or believe he was seeing me. When it finally dawned on him, his facecrunched up in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;The card, ma&#39;am,&#34; Mr. Ming held the card to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I blinked away and took the card from him.My mind was a mess I forgot to say thank you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Jaris doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I glanced at him. The surprise was gone from his face, replaced only by irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kael,Nerion and two other men were behind him, yet I hardly noticed them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a lot of distance between us from where he stood, yet he seemed so close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Uh...we should probably go, ma&#39;am,&#34; Bianca whispered. Likethere was any other way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sucking a breath in, I forced my legs to move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the elevator, I managed another glance at him before the doors would close up. He was talking to some men in suits.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I couldn&#39;t believe it. Would Jaris and I be staying in the same hotel? I didn&#39;t step out of my suite until morning when I had to go for my meeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was torn between wanting to meet with Jaris and praying I didn&#39;t run into him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t meet him on my way to the conference room. How was I even sure he spent the night here? He might&#39;ve left after seeing me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The meeting was long but successful. Myself and the board came to a pleasant conclusion that was beneficial to both parties. Mr. Ming assured me that the necessary documents would be ready by the following day. All I&#39;d have to do is sign and I&#39;d be on my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt sad knowing I&#39;d have to leave this place and get back to my hell with Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the way, if you wouldn&#39;t mind, Ms. Lyric, there&#39;s a little party taking place at the rooftop later tonight,&#34;Mr. Ming offered just as I was about to leave. &#34;You know, it&#39;s something classy and all. There would be a lot of dignitaries in attendance. It&#39;d be a nice opportunity to meet more business-minded people.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It made sense. But that was majorly for someone who gave a shit about the company. I hated that I was doing this job for Caden. I wished his companies weren&#39;t progressing like they were.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But... I could really use the party to clear my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sure. Thank you, Mr. Ming.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We shook hands before I left with Bianca.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca made some reasonable comments about the meeting as we headed for the elevator.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We clicked the button and while we waited for the doors to open, I went through my phone, checking for new emails or texts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t bother lifting my head when the door opened and just simply walked in. Bianca entered hesitantly,and by the time I understood why, it was too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind me was Jaris,on a phone call. I thought of rushing out but even that was too late as the door went closed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the love of the Moon!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I took a deep breath, shut my eyes and tried to make my mind believe he wasn&#39;t behind me right now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But that was too hard to do, especially when I heard his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah, I&#39;ll have to call you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I mentally saw him ending the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Your Highness,&#34; Bianca turned slightly to him as she dipped her head. She couldn&#39;t hide her nervousness like me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris didn&#39;t acknowledge her, which only discouraged me from paying homage. I didn&#39;t even have the confidence to talk to him. I felt so trapped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t realize I hadn&#39;t pressed my floor button yet. How could anything make sense when someone like Jaris was behind me?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was running through his mind-I wondered. Did he hate the fact that I was here? Would he get mad if l at least,greeted him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The elevator&#39;s ascent seemed to take forever. Finally, it reached his floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bianca and I parted ways for him to get through. There was a tiny part of me that wished he&#39;d somehow brush my shoulder. But that didn&#39;t happen. He was careful enough to act like I wasn&#39;t there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t expect him to say anything, but I was wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Next time, you use the next elevator,&#34; he said the words as hewalked out, his back to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I held my breath as the words struck the wrong nerve. The most painful part was, not once did he look at me. I only saw his back as he walked away while the elevator doors closed up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you alright, ma&#39;am?&#34; Bianca asked, her voice soft with concern. &#34;Yeah.Why wouldn&#39;t I be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pressed my floor button and breathed properly as it descended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought my nightmare was over. Or at least, I thought I left it back in the country.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But for the second time today, I was wrong. Because when Bianca and I reached our suite, we found my nightmare waiting at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh,gods.What in the name of Selene was Caden doing here?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore his perfect smile-the one he always wore when he was about to be manipulative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like you&#39;re done,&#34; he shoved off the wall, his hands tucked in his jacket pockets. &#34;Trust the meeting went well?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;d stopped walking. Bianca too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wh-What&#39;re you doing here?&#34; I shook my head, like this was a memory I could disperse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What does it look like? I camne here to surprise you.&#34; He glanced at my feet. &#34;You should come over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart raced painfully. Blinking rapidly, I pushed myself forward, Bianca doing the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, sir,&#34; she bowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bianca. You&#39;ve been doing a great job. How&#39;re you today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Very fine. Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched with detest as he acted like a proper gentleman. Bianca had no idea he was a monster behind closed doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden returned his gaze to me. &#34;You don&#39;t seem too happy to see me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s-It&#39;s not that. I just wasn&#39;t expecting you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hm.&#34; He smiled. &#34;Can I get my hug, then?&#34; What the hell? Asking me for a hug in front of Bianca?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people out there believed Caden and I had a good relationship. If I were to reject his offer now in front of Bianca, it&#39;d seem off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His smile spread as I approached him. He definitely knew what he was doing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I gave him the shortest hug I could before we all proceeded into the suite.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why did I have a feeling Caden&#39;s arrival had something to do with Jaris being here? He&#39;s never accompanied me on any of my trips before.Why would he show up all of a sudden?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The suite contained two rooms. Bianca proceeded to her room while Caden followed me to mine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Okay. Where was he going to spend the night? Because he definitely wasn&#39;t sleeping with me here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I quietly walked to the table where I began taking off my jewelries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caden was behind me, keeping me scared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you seen him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the one question that confirmed my suspicion. It had to do with Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Ming? Yes. We just finished from the meeting&#34; I pretended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He laughed, though the laughter ended as quickly as it started.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t play smart with me, Lyric. You know who I&#39;m talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Except I don&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed toward me, grabbed my shoulders and roughly turned me around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t fucking upset me. Have you seen him!?&#34; His eyes flashed with burning rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I didn&#39;t know he was here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He held my gaze for a long time before letting me go. &#34;Good. Now be sure to keep it that way.&#34; I glared at his back as he walked over to the closet. How the hell did he know Jaris was here? Was there a spy in Jaris&#39; pack?</p>
