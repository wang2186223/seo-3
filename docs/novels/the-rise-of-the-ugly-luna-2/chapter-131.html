                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d think this was a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I knew what she was up to when she stood behind me. I knew she wanted to give me a massage-something that was beyond weird.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to stop her, except my hands didn&#39;t work with my brain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The second her hands touched me, I was enchanted,trapped in a time and place I didn&#39;t want to escape from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands on me were divine, bringing me sensations I didn&#39;t think were possible from mere hands. How the hell was she able to do it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, despite how strange the situation was, despite the fact that I should&#39;ve stopped her, I sat there and let her. And enjoyed it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d think she was doing this because she liked me. But I knew what she was there for. I knew the mark she was looking for. And I knew she&#39;d gotten her answer the moment she lowered the shirt from my neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I kept my eyelids sealed, giving her the freedom to discover her answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no mark there. No color. And I sensed her disappointment the moment she saw it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rolled the shirt up while I pretended not to notice she had dragged it down in the first place. It was a close one. Let&#39;s just say it was a good thing I woke up late today of all days. While I was dressing up, it was Kael that had noticed and pointed it out to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried washing it off but couldn&#39;t. I knew instantly that it was Lyric trying to be smart with me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I had to make use of acid to wash it off. Yeah, fucking acid. It was painful as hell and peeled my skin. It was actually the reason I wore the turtleneck today.Hopefully, the burn would&#39;ve healed up already with my Alpha blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I think it had. Otherwise, she&#39;d have asked me about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt an ache when her hands dropped from my skin,indicating she was done. She walked around to stand in front of the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So... that&#39;s it?&#34; | raised an eyebrow in her direction.&#34;You came all the way here for the first time to give me a massage? I mean, don&#39;t you find that strange?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes looked so disappointed. She couldn&#39;t even meet my gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What? Had she been hoping to see the mark on me?To know it was real and not a dream?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, you didn&#39;t try to stop me,&#34; she crossed her hands and shrugged as she said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I chuckled, twirling in my seat. &#34;How&#39;s my sister?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, she looked at me, surprise in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So,you do care about her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think I don&#39;t?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t know. You&#39;ve been really cold toward her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Cold?&#34; I huffed. &#34;Do I need to remind you who it was that stabbed me with a poisonous blade?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twisted her lips, clearly sensing I was right.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Maddy is a disrespectful little piece of shit. But it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care about her. Now, tell me, do you think she&#39;s getting any better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Another shrug. &#34;I think she&#39;s pretty cool when she wants to be.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I nodded. At least, that was progress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you want a drink?&#34; | didn&#39;t know what else was left for us to do now that she was done with her discovery. &#34;N-No. I&#39;m about leaving, actually.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I said nothing but kept my eyes on her. I noticed that always had a way of unnerving her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Goodbye, then.&#34; She turned toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You know, Lyric, if you really want to help, there are better things you could do other than the massage.&#34;My words halted her at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned around to face me, seeming a little nervous. &#34;And...what could that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I flicked the pen in my hand. &#34;You should remember.I made mention of it some time ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t seem to, her brows furrowing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to help her. &#34;It has to do with my sex organ.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Lyric blush out of embarrassment was a sight I could watch on repeat. I always enjoyed how her green eyes had this gleamn like there were stars in them, how her lips parted like they were made that way, and how her neck and cheeks reddened instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d seen a lot of people blush, but there was always something different about Lyric&#39;s. And each time, it created a ripple of something profound within me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-&#34; She stuttered for words but in the end, no words formed.She was completely speechless.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Again, I helped her. &#34;You know, you were supposed to provide me with some treatment before we grew distant. I want to believe the treatment is still available.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It isn&#39;t,&#34; she rushed the words out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something she was desperately hiding.I had a feeling it had to do with intimacy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I needed this. Perhaps, if I could enjoy intimacy with other women, I wouldn&#39;t be stuck with her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, won&#39;t you give it a try, at least?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could reply, my phone vibrated in my pocket,distracting us.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I thought of ignoring it, but when I saw it was Aris,one of my Pack&#39;s security men, I took it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lyric took a deep breath as she looked away,obviously relieved that I was distracted by something. Well, she was joking if she thought I was done with this conversation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; I rasped as soon as Itook the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Sorry for disturbing, Alpha Jaris. But we found some of them. Feeders.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In less than forty minutes, I was at the location Aris sent me, together with Kael and Nerion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There were by the roadside, although the area was deserted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the floor were six dead people. I recognized two of them to be members of my Pack. The other four,I didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me they were Feeders. &#34; thought you said they were alive,&#34; I gritted the words at Aris who was standing beside the bodies with eight other of his men. My men, actually.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That one was,&#34; he pointed at one of the bodies.&#34;had no idea they had a pill under their tongue. He swallowed it and choked while you were on your way.There was nothing I could do to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He killed himself to protect &#39;him&#39;?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, Alpha. I couldn&#39;t even get any answers from him before he died.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I brushed my fingers into my hair, my frustration mounting. Where the fuck was he?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since the attack on Lyric, security had been doubled.Now, I had men scouting the area from time to time to ensure none of my people fell victims again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the second time my men were killing the Feeders. But that was the problem-they always ended up dead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Feeders were deadly. One bite on you and that was it. They&#39;d suck you off before you even get the time to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As a result, it was difficult to take them down without killing them. I honestly didn&#39;t know what to do anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Where was my asshole of a brother? I knew this was all his doing. Fuck, he was definitely the one who murdered the Alpha King. It&#39;d explain why the person in the footage looked familiar and how he knew all the ins and outs of the House.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I didn&#39;t get it. Why would he kill King Thaddeus?Why had he been in the shadows all this time? What was he playing at?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whatever this was, I didn&#39;t like it. I felt this creeping sensation behind my neck that told me something unpleasant was coming.</p>
