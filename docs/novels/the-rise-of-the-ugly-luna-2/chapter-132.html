                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, the day we&#39;ve all been waiting for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was at my busiest, checking the staff to make sure they were doing all they were supposed to.Checking the decorations going on in the field to ensure every design was just in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was quite hectic, but hell, I loved it!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was my first time getting involved in a kid&#39;s party,and there was a certain joy it brought me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran to the room to check how the kids were doing.The room was busy with people moving about,grabbing things, fixing things. Xylon was already getting dressed while Xyla was still getting her hair styled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;By the Moon, you aren&#39;t done with her?&#34; I let out a gasp directed at the stylis</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m almost done. Just three more minutes,&#34; the woman dipped her head as her fingers moved faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Aunty, how do I look?!&#34; Xyla trilled with delight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rushed to place my hands on her shoulders.darling,you look magnificent!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Magfi-Mani...&#34; I laughed as she tried to pronounce the big word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And me?&#34; The sound of Xylon&#39;s voice ignited a cozy warmth within my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I went to him, dropped to a crouch and cupped his soft cheeks. &#34;You are the most handsome man on the planet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He lowered his eyes and giggled. For the love of the moon, I could listen to Xylon&#39;s giggles all day and still wouldn&#39;t be satisfied. I always enjoyed seeing h10W the tip of his nose turned slightly pink. I stood by and watched as the stylist dressed him up.When he finished, he picked up Xylon&#39;s box of jewelry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He selected a square-shaped magnetic earring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you think the other one will be best?&#34; I pointed at the round shape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stylist looked at it and nodded. &#34;I think you&#39;re-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What makes you think you can make decisions for my kids?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone paused when we heard the voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart jumped into my throat as I turned to the door and found Marta making her way in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She seemed dressed for the party-wearing a long purple dress that swept the floor behind her.Her hair was sleek and fell smoothly on her back. Her makeup was dark and just perfect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,Marta Monroe looked fucking gorgeous tonight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She should be. She was the mother of the celebrants.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I asked a question,&#34; her voice was clipped. &#34;What&#39;re you even doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I looked around, glancing at the workers who were trying and failing to mind their business. Then, I gave her a questioning look of &#39;what&#39;re you doing?&#39;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Please, Marta. Not today. Not here.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flicked her gaze down to my feet, then up to my face and scoffed. &#34;Look at you, being all busy while everyone else is getting ready. Someone could easily mistake you for the mother of the kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Well, I was just trying to help,&#34; I tried to keep the bitterness out of my voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She looked past me, at Xylon and the stylist. &#34;Go with the square shape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wanted to roll my eyes. Why was she being so dramatic?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She must know the circle earring was better,but anything to go against me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well, I didn&#39;t say anything to her. Today was a special day and I wasn&#39;t about to let her ruin it for me or the kids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But, mummy, don&#39;t you think aunty Lyric is right? |also think the other one would be better on Xylon,&#34;Xyla said from her seat, staring at us through the mirror.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look Marta gave her could have annihilated her if looks could kill. She seemed to hold back her retort because of the people around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mummy always knows best, Xyla.&#34; As she said this,she kept her eyes on me, a malicious glint in them.&#34;You should always listen to me, your mum.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I rolled my eyes and scoffed. The girl was utterly shameless. She didn&#39;t even care that there were people in the room with us that could spread rumours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Relax, Marta. Nobody&#39;s dragging your mummy title with you,&#34; I said, getting ready to leave. &#34;It&#39;s normal for people to actually like others. And me still being undressed while others were getting ready should actually worry you instead of making you jealous.I mean, the whole time, you were busy taking care of your looks while someone else was looking after your kids.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her jaw was set in a frown, and an airy feeling settled softly in my heart. Well, if she wanted to be dramatic in front of strangers, I wouldn&#39;t be the one they refer to as the quiet one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked out of the room, refusing to let Marta&#39;s words hurt any further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching my room, I finally showered and got ready.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I already called in a hair stylist and a makeup artist.Simultaneously, they worked on my appearance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time I was done and staring at my reflection in the mirror, I was wholly fascinated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You look so gorgeous, ma&#39;am,&#34; the hairstylist beamed and even clapped his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It drew a chuckle from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The event was already starting. I could hear the music coming from the field.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I settled the stylist and makeup artist and was about to leave myself when a painful thought crossed my mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Executioner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was still yet to hear from Jace. Since the previous day, I&#39;d been trying to occupy my mind with other things so I don&#39;t think of the impending doom coming my way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even now, I shut my eyes and shook the thought off.Today was a special day. I could worry about my problems tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I made my way out of the room and came face to face with Luna Isolde at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I muttered an expression under my breath, shocked from just randomly bumping into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Greetings, Luna.&#34; I dipped my head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was dressed like a Queen that she was,everything about her appearance regal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luna Isolde was mostly quiet around here. If she wasn&#39;t out shopping with friends, she&#39;d be on a vacation or on some sort of trip. The woman didn&#39;t have anything else that bothered her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what was she doing in my room today?</p>
