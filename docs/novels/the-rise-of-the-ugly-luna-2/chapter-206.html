                <p>MARTA</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mirth was gone from her face. She looked vicious now as she stepped toward me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re doing? You probably forced yourself on Jaris and quickly took in for him. All for what? To secure your spot beside him? Well, guess who&#39;s still Queen,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>| laughed in her face. &#34;Oh, poor Marta.&#34; I tsked.&#34;Stupid Marta. Always thinking everything&#39;s a competition. What Jaris and I share is special and something I&#39;ll never call a competition. Sadly, it&#39;s also something you&#39;ll never be able to understand as you&#39;ve hardly ever been in love.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck me, furrowing my brows.&#34;Have you ever been in love,Marta?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The further crumbling of her mask said it all. &#34;Good gods,&#34; I muttered, faking pity. &#34;You&#39;ve never actually been loved by someone. Your whole life,you&#39;ve only wanted a man who has never really wanted you. A man who only made you Grand Luna &#39;cause he chose his kids. And despite being grand Luna, you&#39;re still insecure because you know you&#39;ll never own his heart. You, Marta Monroe, sadly, will live the rest of her life wanting a man she&#39;ll never have.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I watched her hands ball into fists, and they only brought a bright smile to my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She took a threatening step toward me, so close our feet were touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Careful now, people are watching,&#34; I chuckled. &#34;It&#39;s not a good sight, you know? Watching their queen get into a fight. Please, don&#39;t embarrass yourself any further.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I walked past her, brushing her shoulder in the process. I didn&#39;t need anyone to tell me my words were going to sting for a really long time. The day got busier for me. A lot of sick people made their way to me, asking to be healed. I was surprised when my powers worked as back then, I hadn&#39;t been able to use it on Caden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I healed a lot of them, so happy I didn&#39;t have to hide or make it a secret.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The outcome of the whole event became more than l expected. More people kept coming, and so did my praises ring on everyone&#39;s lips. They kept calling me a savior, an answered prayer and how they regretted not going against this law long before now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Safe to say it was the happiest day of my life. The day my kind got accepted in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>＊＊＊＊十</p>
                
                
                
                <p>JARIS</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was amazing when a situation went from bad to good in the blink of an eye. Just yesterday, I wasn&#39;t sure if my plan would work to keep Lyric safe,but here we were, everything completely fine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nobody told me being the Alpha King came with this much workload. I&#39;d been receiving letters upon letters, files to be reviewed and complaints to go over. Although, Lucas told me the workload was only this much because the position of the Alpha King had been vacant for long, causing the work to pile up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I decided to go through the recent batch of letters I&#39;d received for the day before going on a break. It was going fine until I came across one that unsettled me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#39;You really think Siphons are safe?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because Lyric is your mate?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why don&#39;t you wait around and see how dangerous she becomes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We&#39;ll gladly show you.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a concerned Member.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I checked the back but couldn&#39;t see any details of the sender. I dialed Kael&#39;s line, requesting him in my office. It didn&#39;t take long before he arrived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I need to know who sent this,&#34; I told him atsr giving him the letter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Displeasure shadowed his face when he read the content. &#34;Who the fuck is this creep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I pushed the rest of the letters aside, concluding l was done for the day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Um...by the way,&#34; Kael removed an envelope from his back pocket. &#34;I got the pictures you asked for.The staff from the hotel.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Great.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good job,&#34; I took the envelope from him and started toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You did well, King,&#34; Kael&#39;s words stopped me at the door. &#34;Standing up for Lyric like that... Never thought I&#39;d see the day when my friend would so helplessly be in love.&#34; I lowered my head in a chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Friend. I liked the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Myself, Kael and Nerion have always had it on the back of our minds that we were friends, but it wasn&#39;t often we used the word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But I liked hearing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I left the room, going to the field where I knew Lyric would be.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As expected, she was surrounded by a lot of people.There were some sick ones by the side and the ones she&#39;d obviously healed on another side. Their families were present, adding to the overall rowdiness of the place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hell, no. She can&#39;t keep up with this. They&#39;d drain her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The people bowed their heads and parted as I walked forward. Lyric, who was too busy siphoning a woman didn&#39;t even notice me until I put a hand around her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She released a deep breath, staring up at me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on,&#34; I took her hand. &#34;That&#39;s enough. Let&#39;s go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wanted to argue, but I didn&#39;t give her the chance as I forced her to her feet and started walking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;There are still a lot of them I need to attend to!&#34; She whined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Exactly. A lot of them. You&#39;ll burn out if you keep at this rate. You don&#39;t put yourself through this stress when you know you&#39;re carrying my child&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That seemed to shut her up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We reached the room where she fell on the bed like she&#39;d been doing very strenuous work for days.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat next to her, placed her legs on mine and started massaging her feet. She seemed surprised but finally relaxed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>We talked about each other&#39;s day and how perfect everything was going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She suddenly sat up. &#34;So... I think I could finally work on your....&#34; she cleared her throat, her eyes lowering slightly to my groin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I got the message and burst out laughing. &#34;Lyric Harper, are you still shy around me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What? Hell no!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Then, say it.&#34; My tone turned a bit serious,challenging her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks turned pink at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Lyric-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come on, you know what I&#39;m talking about. If you don&#39;t want my help, just say it.&#34; She laid back on the bed,pouting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was impossible keeping the smile off my face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Of course I want your help.&#34; She rolled her eyes.&#34;So, looks like you&#39;re finally bold enough to touch my cock?&#34; &#34;Jaris!&#34; She startled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, stop acting like a virgin. I&#39;ve fucked you enough times to know better.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes rounded as her lips dropped open in shock.She looked like she wanted to say so many things at once but didn&#39;t know which to start fromn. In the end,she just shook her head and fell back on the bed.</p>
