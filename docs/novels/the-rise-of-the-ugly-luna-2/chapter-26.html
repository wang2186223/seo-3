                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No.Not that.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could take anything from me. Not that necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The scanned image was the first valuable thing I had. This was the second. I couldn&#39;t afford to be away from it for one second.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I tried to take it back from him, but he pulled his hand away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, give it back.&#34; I couldn&#39;t control how shaky my voice was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stared at it, like he held some sort of admiration for it. He rolled his thumb along the locket, and in that moment, I yearned for oblivion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I think this will do,&#34; he nodded. &#34;Goodnight,Lyric.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No. You&#39;ve got to be kidding me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, you have it to give it back. You can&#39;t take it from me.&#34; I ran after him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt cold tears on my cheeks. Oh, damn it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He kept walking until he reached the parkinglot. Kael and Nerion were already there, the backseat hanging open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris got in, completely ignoring my pleas. Where the hell was he going?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door was shut and Kael and Nerion got into the front door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hand it back!&#34; I was angry now, slamming my hand against the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The asshole had the guts to stare at me through the window, letting me see how superior he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car started and drove off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was losing my mind. I couldn&#39;t let him get away with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a waiting cab nearby and without thinking, I got in. &#34;Follow them!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The cabby seemed hesitant but went after them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I cried in the backseat. That locket contained ashes from my babies&#39; clothes. After I lost them, I&#39;d burnt the little clothes I bought for them and put some of the ashes in the locket so I could have it with me all the time.It was my own way of feeling their presence as I had not even been able to get their bodies to bury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no idea-he was holding a locket containing remnants of his babies&#39; belongings. Of course,he didn&#39;t care.And if they&#39;d been alive, I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d have let him come near them. A man like him didn&#39;t deserve to be around children.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My cab man followed him until he drove into a suite. But before I could pay the man and rush out of the cab,he was already going through the revolving doors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I ran after him but was stopped by the security at the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Do you have a reservation, ma&#39;am? If yes, we&#39;d like to see your details.&#34; The first one said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Geez, Jaris was getting farther away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I don&#39;t have a reservation I just need to see someone.&#34; My eyes were on Jaris as I answered hurriedly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay. But first, we&#39;ll need to confirm from the person that you&#39;re to be let in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Huh? Jaris would never agree to let me in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Fine. I want to make a reservation!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but we&#39;re fully booked for the night. If you&#39;d like it, we have other amazing branches we could-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t give a hoot about your hotel. I just need to see someone, and he&#39;s getting away!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jaris was already getting into the elevator. My heart crumbled as he pinned me with his gaze, letting me know he won.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m really sorry. These policies are set in place to ensure the safety of our guests. And you know the city&#39;s quite busy today.Considering the King&#39;s funeral...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man continued talking, but his voice was soon blocked out by the roar in my ears</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I clutched the sides of my dress as I stared at the elevator which had long gone up. Jaris was gone.With one thing that meant the world to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was so broken, I couldn&#39;t leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I found a spot to sit within the vicinity, and it was a good thing none of the securities tried to get me to leave.Because I didn&#39;t plan on leaving. I was going to stay here and wait for Jaris to give back my necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having it taken from me suddenly brought back the pain I&#39;d never truly healed from.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My babies. I didn&#39;t even get to hold them in my arms. Maybe, my life would&#39;ve taken a different turn if l hadn&#39;t lost them. If the cruel hands of death didn&#39;t take them from me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After my time with Jaris five years ago, I discovered I was pregnant. But since I didn&#39;t know who he was back then, and I&#39;d been abandoned by him and everyone else around me, I had to handle the pregnancy myself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I met a woman-Penelope-who was very kind, took me in and helped me. But unfortunately, my babies died at birth. I never even got to see them. I&#39;d been in an accident and passed out, so an operation had to be done on me to get them out. And when I regained consciousness, I was told they didn&#39;t survive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only odd thing was the fact that I didn&#39;t get to see Penelope either. According to the nurse I&#39;d seen when I woke up, she told me Penelope had an emergency and had to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I&#39;d been looking for Penelope since then but to no avai. I only wanted to know where my babies were buried.I wanted to be able to spend time with them, sometimes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It&#39;s possible she had buried them that night since I was unconscious, but I wanted to know where.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sat there, in front of the waterfall for hours, my tears not stopping. I was there until late into the night, even when the atmosphere had gotten quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t have a single strength in me anymore. I felt so weak without the locket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At a point, one of the securities came up to me. But it was out of concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t have a place to stay, I could offer some help. Our storage room is locked right now, but I&#39;m with the keys....”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t need a place to stay,&#34; Imuttered weakly without looking at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t mind staying here until morning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, the more I stayed out here in the cold, hungry and exhausted, my rage toward him amplified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I heard the departing steps of the security, but not long after, new ones approached. Could they leave me alone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why&#39;s it so important?&#34; I gasped and turned at the sound of his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was there, wearing simpler night outfits but looking every bit of the annoying man that he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had my necklace in his hand, giving it a puzzled look. &#34;You&#39;re willing to spend the night here, just to get this back.&#34; He held it up. &#34;What makes it so special?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I sniffled, wiping my tears as I stood up. I avoided his gaze. By the moon, I was so mad at him I wished I could give him a punch. But that would only be me writing my death sentence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence stretched between us for a while. He must&#39;ve seen that I had no intention of speaking to him, and by some miracle, he handed the necklace back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Never disobey me, Lyric. For as long as you&#39;re with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My answer was a hard glare, my eyes still rimming with unshed tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I picked up my purse and walked past him, heading to the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I felt relieved. So so relieved. But I was still wounded that he could be this cruel to do this to me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Getting to the road, I looked out for cabs. There were still a few cars driving around. I should be able to see one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bidding time, I stared at the necklace in my hand, a sad smile touching my lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was the last blissful moment I had for the night as a car, seemingly intentionally, ran into me, bringing me to the ground.</p>
