                <p>LYRIC</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;ve been out for a long time,&#34; he tilted his head to the side. &#34;I want to believe your memory is still intact?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An intense, biting acidity flooded my mouth, making me wince with its harshness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He didn&#39;t recognize me. Back then, when his eyes opened, he&#39;d only seen the ugly girl.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered at my situation. I was sure those men behind him were Feeders. But what was he doing with them? And why did they give him so much respect like he was their leader or something?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Over here, Lyric,&#34; he spoke again. He and Jaris had almost the same voice. The silver eyes were the same-even Maddy had it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;When I ask a question, you&#39;re meant to answer.&#34; He took his hand to my throat, and I winced when he cut me with his claw to prove his point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please,&#34; I whimpered, attempting to pull my neck away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to give me answers.&#34; His claw was out of my neck already, but his hand was still close enough to make me fear he would cut me again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What did he want me to say?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Y-Yes.I remember.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand dropped to his side, his dark gaze watching me like a hawk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re quite beautiful,&#34; he murmured. &#34;Could it be the reason Jaris made you his mate?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My heart continued thumping against my ribcage.I wasn&#39;t one to be easily intimidated, yet before this very man, I was petrified.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything about him screamed danger.Madness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was the kind of man anyone would want to avoid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know,&#34; his hand was back to my throat again, making me flinch. He trailed his elongated claw against the hollows of my neck, teasing me with a cut that never came. &#34;If I cut deep enough, you will die.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved the claw downward, going to my chest. To my alter shock, he ripped my shirt open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No!&#34; I screamed. &#34;What&#39;re you.... what&#39;re you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he didn&#39;t seem the least bothered about my reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My chest was exposed, revealing the black bra l had on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I shivered when his index claw came between my breasts. &#34;That&#39;s the secret of my claws. A cut like this...&#34; he broke my skin with his claw, eliciting a sharp cry from me as this was more painful than the one from my neck.&#34;...will not kill you. It&#39;d only hurt for a long time.But let&#39;s say I go deeper.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, don&#39;t! Please!&#34; I panicked, fearing he&#39;d puncture my heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped, his lips lifting in a cruel smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I went deeper than this, your heart would stop beating in no time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I was visibly shaking. His hand was still between my breasts, his index finger beneath my skin which was bleeding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Can you imagine how devastating that would be for you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered in relief when he withdrew his claw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What do you want from me?&#34; | sniffled. &#34;Please, I haven&#39;t done anything.&#34; He chuckled-a dark sound that made me want to run into hiding.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You haven&#39;t done anything, dear Lyric.&#34; He straightened up, snapping his fingers at the boys behind him. &#34;I just needed someone important to my brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As if the boys behind him knew what he wanted,one of them moved to grab a chair in the corner of the room. He brought it to Jaris&#39; brother who took a seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I-I&#39;m not important. The only person that might be important to him is Marta.&#34; I knew that was a lie.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Marta might have kids for him, but I knew she wasn&#39;t that important to Jaris.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nah,&#34; the man before me clicked his tongue. &#34;That hoe isn&#39;t important. Trust me, he&#39;d have made her his mate if she was.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked the same age as Jaris-Young, handsome and cold. But I heard he was the eldest. Although,the age difference was less than three years. &#34;Just in case you didn&#39;t know, I&#39;m Caden.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Of course, I knew. His name and that of his brother had been popular in our world while growling up.I just didn&#39;t know what they looked like.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, seeing them was a privilege.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you know,&#34; he pulled his chair closer to mine.So close, our knees were touching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I wriggled in my seat. I didn&#39;t like how exposed I was before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My brother had me imprisoned for eight years.&#34; He tsked. &#34;Eight years, Lyric. You tell me, is that fair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Judging from what he&#39;d done to me so far, I couldn&#39;t feel sorry for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His fist against my face came fast. My head fell back as l yelped from the punch, blackness enveloping me temporarily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oh, gods. Oh, gods. I was going to die.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I told you to give me answers.&#34; His voice was normal, like he hadn&#39;t just punched the living daylight out of me.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes!&#34; I cried before opening my teary eyes at him.&#34;Yes, I think it was fair.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t until the last word wvas out that I realized my foolishness. Damn it. In such cases, I should be on his side. Antagonizing him was only going to provoke him further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m so-&#34; the words didn&#39;t get to leave my lips before his fist connected with my left eye.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>My head rang with a distorting sound, my mind going blank for a minute.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please...&#34; I sobbed when I could find my voice again,though it was shaky. &#34;Please, stop.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the first time I was ever getting abused, and the feeling was worse than hell.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Open your eyes, Lyric.&#34; It was a chilling command.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I didn&#39;t waste time. I forced my eyes open, the left one feeling painful. I knew it was only a matter of time before a bruise formed under it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears slipped down as I forced them to stay open on the monster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You think it was fair?&#34; The way he spoke, it was so unbothered as though it was out of mere curiosity.&#34;You think it was fair that I was deprived of eight years of my life? That my younger brother is recognized as King while everyone thinks I&#39;m dead?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34; I whimpered, fearing he might hit me again out of pure rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands rested above his knees as he leaned forward, his face so close to mine. &#34;I&#39;m the eldest,Lyric. Your mate is in my place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I whimpered when his hand came to my thighs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please. Don&#39;t... Just let me go.&#34; I knew my request was laughable, but I didn&#39;t know what else to say at this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His claws were out on all fingers. searing pain slithered from my/ right leg when four of his claws scratched me right there, ripping through my jeans and drawing blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I threw my head back and cried, attempting to pull my leg from his hold, but it was useless when my feet were bound to the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jaris has everything I want,&#34; he cut a fresh part of my body. &#34;A feared name,&#34; he cut under my ribs. &#34;A beautiful mate,&#34; under my jaw. &#34;Kids.&#34; He hissed as he scratched me on the hips. &#34;Family!&#34;</p>
