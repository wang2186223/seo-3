                <p>Still looking a little bewildered, Verena asked with earnest sincerity, &#34;Dr. Owen, I remain unsure. Could you tell me plainly what I should do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther offered a gentle smile and answered with patience, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, my advice is to tend both body and spirit at the same time. Right now, the key issue isn&#39;t to restore every memory at once, but rather to lift your mother&#39;s mood first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his hands moved to emphasize his words.&#34;The physical concerns cannot be set aside, of course.But if emotional distress is soothed, then recovery will be half the battle won.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, reflecting a moment, and then met Verena&#39;s gaze. &#34;You should try to create more chances for her to interact with you, her daughter.From her records and from what you&#39;ve just said,there&#39;s something vital. Your mother remembers you only as a small baby. That is not a curse but a window of opportunity.You may relive those early years with her,almost as though walking the same road once more.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hope flickered in Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;So, you mean letting her get to know me gradually, little by little?&#34; Exactly. You have the right idea.&#34; Luther&#39;s smile deepened with appreciation. &#34;Begin with the simple threads of daily life. Play lighthearted games-puzzles,perhaps, or a board game. Walk with her in the park and talk along the way. And, as you share these moments, weave stories of your own journey-of school days, of youth, of college, and the present. As she pictures her daughter growing step by step,her heart will find ease,and her healing will be swifter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening closely, Verena rose to her feet and offered a small bow, her voice full of gratitude. &#34;Thank you,Dr. Owen. I&#39;ll try it. I&#39;ll do my utmost to help my mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther stood as well, extending his hand with a smile.&#34;I believe you can. And should you face any obstacle or need support, do not hesitate to reach me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena clasped his hand, her lips curved in a smile steeped in thankfulness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After parting ways with Luther, she stepped out of the café and walked to the car waiting by the roadside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver opened the door, and she slipped into the back seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The engine started with a low roar, and soon the car was gliding down the street. Her gaze wandered to the window. The scenery slipped by like a slideshow, swift and fleeting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Crowds hurried, cars streamed endlessly, yet she felt no urge to admire the city&#39;s pulse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes remained fixed in the distance, quiet and faraway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two burdens pressed heavily against her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One bore the name of Isaac, the other,her mother.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both needed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unconsciously,her hand came to rest on her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling the swelling curve beneath her palm, she lowered her head, a tender smile gracing her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the smile faltered soon after, stiffening as the reality weighed down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s recovery, her mother&#39;s condition, and the child she carried-all demanded the best of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That mixture of joy and pressure tugged her heart in two directions at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing a deep breath, Verena straightened her back.Resolve rekindled in her eyes, a flame refusing to die out. At least, she told herself, Isaac&#39;s matter already had a path forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night descended upon Seraphina Villas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moon was veiled behind drifting clouds, stars scattered like faint pinpricks of silver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the study, Isaac sat at the broad mahogany desk,his posture upright, mind buried in work.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows were faintly drawn, his face stern in its silence. Under the lamplight, his lashes traced a soft shadow across his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door creaked open just a little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still busy?&#34; A voice, gentle and melodious, slipped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s hands stilled. He lifted his eyes toward the sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There,Verena stood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since her pregnancy, she had favored loose gowns that flowed with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now she wore a creamy-white silk nightgown,its hem brushing her knees, her rounded belly softly outlined,her legs smooth and graceful beneath.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though her face bore no cosmetics, her skin shone with a natural glow, and a few loose strands framed her bun, lending her an effortless charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s sternness dissolved at once, a faint smile tugging at his lips. &#34;Just a little longer. Are you sleepy?I could watch you fall asleep and then come back to finish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, he guided his wheelchair closer to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in a gentle smile. She shook her head and walked inside. &#34;Not yet. I saw how hard you were working and thought I might sit with you, keep you company, and ease your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving behind him, she placed her hands on his shoulders and began kneading with practiced care,her touch firm yet tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Little by little, the tension left Isaac&#39;s body.Weariness faded from his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head slightly, teasing, &#34;I had no idea you were so skilled at this, darling. Where did you learn it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful smile appeared at Verena&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned forward, strands of hair tumbling down,brushing his cheek with a feather&#39;s touch. Drawing closer, she let her warm breath skim his ear as she whispered, mischievous and mysterious, &#34;From a man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, the smile on his face stiffening. A flicker of unease darkened his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted, and he started to turn, but her hands pressed lightly on his shoulders, holding him still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Which man?&#34; His voice carried urgency, though he tried to mask it with calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tension amused Verena, endearing in its way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She straightened and gave his shoulders a playful squeeze. &#34;My grandma often had backaches,so lonce learned a few tricks from a massage therapist. He was a seasoned master. Why? Are you jealous?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a slow breath as the truth settled.He realized he had been toyed with. Feigning annoyance,he chided, &#34;You do enjoy making sport of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laughed softly, patting his shoulder,her voice light and coaxing. &#34;Well, I only wanted to lift your spirits since you&#39;ve been working so hard.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shook his head, half resigned, half indulgent, yet the smile lingering on his lips betrayed his affection.</p>
