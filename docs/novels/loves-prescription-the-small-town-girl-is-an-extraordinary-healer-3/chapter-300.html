                <p>&#34;By the way.&#34; Verena tilted her head, a gentle smile resting on her lips as she softly remarked, &#34;Rhonda warmed some milk. I already had a glass, and it was quite good. Let me bring you one.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was never fond of such drinks. He lightly caught her hand, stopping her. &#34;Thank you, but I&#39;ll pass.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Verena acted as if his words had drifted past her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her hand free and turned, stepping out of the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her vanish at the doorway, Isaac shook his head.Still, a faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes glowing with affection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther&#39;s words lingered in Verena&#39;s mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She knew Isaac cared deeply for her, and to help him heal,she needed to create moments that stirred his instincts without his noticing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon she returned, the milk warm, steam curling upward as she walked back toward the study. At the doorway, she let out a sudden exclamation.&#34;Oh no!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone rang with carefully measured alarm-enough to carry clearly into the study, but not so sharp as to sound false.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac sat typing, immersed in documents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena&#39;s startled cry reached him,he snapped his head up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before reason could intervene, instinct spoke louder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His palms pressed down on the wheelchair&#39;s arms,and long-weakened legs sprang into motion with surprising force.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Like a tightly wound spring let loose, he rose from the chair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But though he had stood before, his legs, long strangers to weight,failed him at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After only a few faltering steps, his knees buckled, and he crashed forward heavily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dull thud echoed coldly through the silent room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gritting against panic, Isaac raised his head, eyes wide with helplessness as he cried out, &#34;Verena! What&#39;s wrong?&#34; Fear laced his voice, each word trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But no reply came, and his heart gave a violent shudder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He clenched his jaw, struggling against the floor with his arms,desperate to rise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His legs, however,felt like stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anxious and consumed only by Verena&#39;s safety, he cast aside all thought of his own state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, answer me! Are you hurt?&#34; His brows knitted tightly as he shouted again, &#34;Rhonda! Rhonda!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the doorway, Verena had been listening to every sound,her heart hammering with both eagerness and dread.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she heard the crash, her chest clenched,all pretense forgotten, her only prayer that Isaac remained unharmed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rushed inside without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There he was-lying awkwardly on the floor, his usual composure gone, clothes disordered, beads of sweat on his brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac!&#34; Verena gasped, darting forward to his side,reaching down to lift him. Her arms wrapped firmly around his, pouring every ounce of strength into guiding him to the sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before she could straighten, Isaac suddenly clutched her arms with unexpected force, making her freeze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes searched her up and down, frantic. &#34;Verena,are you hurt? Show me the wound!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight of his near-desperate worry struck Verena with both warmth and guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She laid her hand gently over his, steadying him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then her other hand moved softly to her rounded belly, caressing it as a calm smile spread across her lips. &#34;Isaac, I&#39;m fine. Don&#39;t be so tense. The baby just kicked suddenly, and I was startled. I&#39;m sorry to worry you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes dropped at once to her belly,surprise flashing before the storm in his gaze began to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He exhaled unevenly, still frowning but with a gentler tone. &#34;So it was only the baby? No pain, no other discomfort?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Saying so,he too reached out, placing his palm over hers. Verena nodded, her smile softening further.&#34;Nothing more. The baby&#39;s strong now-maybe just eager to greet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Isaac&#39;s taut nerves finally began to loosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a long breath, drew Verena into his arms,and rested his chin upon her shoulder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment he was silent; then, hoarsely, he confessed, &#34;It tears at me-not being able to reach you the moment you&#39;re in distress.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His embrace tightened, as though he feared she might slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned into him, sadness wwashing over her at his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She circled her arms around him,patting his back with a gentleness one might offer a wounded child.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, hush now. You&#39;ve done more than enough.You stood for me, didn&#39;t you? That shows your legs are waking again-all because you care. How could I possibly blame you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Isaac bowed his head, his voice muffled against her shoulder. &#34;But I failed to reach you in time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted his face, guiding his eyes to hers. &#34;That&#39;s enough of this discouraging talk.&#34; Her brows drew in mock sternness, though her tone held comfort.&#34;Answer me one question, will you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her clear eyes held him as she leaned closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, caught off guard, forgot his sorrow for a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze rose to hers, still shadowed but softened.&#34;What is it?&#34; he asked gently, his voice raw yet touched by her nearness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in playful mischief. She blinked,drawing out her words. &#34;First tell me-are you wvilling to answer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertips brushed his cheek, warm and delicate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her teasing spirit, Isaac felt the weight on his chest lift, little by little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint, resigned smile, he answered, &#34;I&#39;m willing.If it&#39;s you asking, I&#39;ll always be willing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his hands covered hers on his cheeks,soaking in her warmth. His eyes brimmed with quiet devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s smile deepened at his reply, her heart glowing all the brighter.</p>
