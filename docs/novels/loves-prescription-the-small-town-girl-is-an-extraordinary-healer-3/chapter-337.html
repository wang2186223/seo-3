                <p>Molly shrank back at the sudden outburst.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shot back, her words sharp as arrows, &#34;What effort? The effort to deceive? Hard work that feeds on lies and bends the law is nothing but empty talk.Even if I stop this project, the only casualty will be the Sampson Group&#39;s investment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed, her voice chilled.&#34;The employees &#39;wages will still be honored. Not a single penny of what they deserve will vanish. But their toil must never serve as a mask for your personal profit!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With those words, Verena pressed a protective hand to her rounded belly and strode swiftly out of the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Zeke, summon everyone tied to this project. An emergency meeting in the conference room-immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her commanding tone rolled through the corridor like a drumbeat,leaving no room for delay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s face shifted, and without a second&#39;s hesitation,she rushed after Verena. However doubtful the employees were of Verena, she remained Luis&#39; sister, and Zeke was sent here by Luis as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Zeke announced, &#34;Mrs. Bennett has called for an urgent meeting,&#34; a shiver of apprehension rippled through the team.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though suspicion hung in the air, none dared to stall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Within five minutes, the conference room brimmed with people.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Murmurs buzzed like restless bees, confusion etched on every face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One whispered, &#34;Could something have gone wrong with the project?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another frowned and muttered, &#34;Who knows? She&#39;s stirring quite a storm so soon after stepping in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While debating, their eyes flicked now and then toward the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Is everyone here?&#34; Verena entered, walked straight to the head of the table,placed both hands firmly on its surface, leaned forward, and swept a razor-sharp gaze across the room. On her right, Molly sat stiff,jaw tight,fingers clenched until her knuckles paled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the nods confirmed attendance, Verena straightened, her tone solemn. &#34;Then I&#39;ll get straight to the point. As the one currently responsible for the company,I hereby announce-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused deliberately, locking eyes with their puzzled stares, before declaring, &#34;The new drug project for epidemic flu violates the pharmaceutical bureau&#39;s regulations and is steeped in unlawful conduct. Therefore, I have decided this project will cease at once!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words dropped like a stone into a still pond, and silence swallowed the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Two.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Three.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then chaos exploded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Kirk family had long been secretly developing their power within Sampson Group, so Molly also held sway in Benedict Pharmaceuticals.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Verena&#39;s announcement, her followers could no  longer hold back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flushed, middle-aged man leapt up, voice booming.&#34;Mrs. Bennett, we&#39;ve poured so much investment into this! Just when the fruits are ready to be reaped, you want to cut the tree down?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner, a young man added quickly,&#34;Exactly!If this project succeeds, every one of us could earn a generous bonus. Shutting it down now is like robbing us of our bread and butter!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His glance slid to Molly, as though awaiting her signal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly reclined slightly, eyes locked on Verena, a faint smirk tugging at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So what if Verena dared tohalt the project?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The company&#39;s resolutions weren&#39;t hers alone to dictate; the senior executives held the final vote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With smug ease, Molly let her gaze sweep the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena clearly didn&#39;t realize that most here had long been in Molly&#39;s camp, bound by years of shared profit and loyalty. They were not about to abandon her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She sat back, eager to watch Verena stumble in this snare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A bespectacled man rose, pushing his glasses up with  pointed emphasis, and spoke with mocking disdain.&#34;Accusing this project of illegality is no small matter.Such charges require hard evidence, not mere words.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression did not waver as she scanned the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They resembled startled birds, shouting over each other,their faces flushed with greed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To them, the company&#39;s reputation and future meant little; all they saw was the glitter of potential bonus.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Verena saw the truth laid bare:most here were Molly&#39;s lackeys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And beyond Molly stood Sherwood-his silence and indulgence spoke volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let Molly run wild, likely eyeing the company&#39;s throne for himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Well,she would never allow it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Straightening, Verena radiated a power that silenced the noise. Her voice rang with iron. &#34;If you insist on carrying this project forward, then I, as Evelyn, vow this-whether or not rivals expose its flaws,I will ensure the public learns it is a sham.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, her gaze slicing the air like a blade,sending chills down the spines of all who met her  eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Moreover, I will reveal every irregularity in the research process. Then the world will see you for what you are. And what awaits you will not be a mere loss of profit or reputation-but the heavy hand of the law.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The room froze again, her words hanging heavy in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds ticked before reality dawned, leaving faces pale and eyes wide as if struck by lightning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes-Verena was none other than the famed medical expert Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her name carried weight across the medical world,and every syllable of hers bore authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she spoke, the public would believe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The project would crumble under the weight of truth,leaving only ruin, disgrace, and endless condemnation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worse still-prison bars loomed in their minds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, fear slithered into many hearts, their earlier boldness melting into unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly watched, seething, as her once-boastful allies shrank back like deflated balloons. Fury surged hot within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly could no longer sit still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once, she had stood unrivaled in the company.Now,before this unexpected &#34;disruptor,&#34; she had to grit her teeth. Her pride was choking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to stay seated, Molly sprang up and strode toward Verena, her words biting. &#34;Mrs. Bennett,are you trying to drag Sampson Group&#39;s reputation through the mud?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,calm as still water, tilted her head slightly and met her glare without flinching. &#34;As the head of Benedict Pharmaceuticals, the power to shape its reputation lies with me-for good or for ill.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was steady, every word carrying the weight of authority. &#34;In the field of medicine,I stand with an advantage none of you can dispute.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes swept across Molly, then the room, before concluding, &#34;Now then, let the voting begin.&#34;</p>
