                <p>The sound of the officers talking reached Danica as she moved along the path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She&#39;s just a young lady. They really didn&#39;t hold back on her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s the truth. If we hadn&#39;t been circling the area on patrol, she could have been abandoned out there in the wilderness with no chance of survival.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Being dumped in the wilderness might almost have been kinder. When more than ten cars surround one and ram into it again and again, the body is crushed to the point that not a single organ is left unharmed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Such a pity... It&#39;s a miracle she managed to stay alive.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their voices grew fainter as they walked away, and Danica slowed until her steps nearly faltered. Each word they spoke pressed against her chest, making her heart squeeze with pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The picture she carried of Katelyn&#39;s danger suddenly sharpened, and it was far more terrifying than she had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if Katelyn sometimes behaved erratically, she would never go so far as to invent a story about her life being in danger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica made it all the way home without breaking out of her daze, and even standing inside her own doorway did nothing to lift the heavy weight inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Far away, in a private villa outside the country, a man dressed in black leaned back in a large office chair, his computer glowing with the image of an ongoing conference call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his subordinate finished giving the report, he narrowed his eyes, and a sinister light flickered in them.&#34;So,she&#39;s still breathing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment the subordinate hesitated, and then answered in a tight voice, &#34;Yes, sir. That&#39;s correct.&#34; The man cursed quietly, his tone low and venomous, &#34;Useless idiots. What do I even keep you around for?&#34;In a rush, the subordinate defended himself. &#34;Sir, this country, Akoitha, doesn&#39;t operate the way Clokron does. You can&#39;t carry out these things so openly there. When the police arrivedI on the scene,retreat was the only option we had.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lighting a cigarette, the man took a long drag, and then released the smoke in a slow ring that drifted through the room. &#34;Where is she now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She was taken to a hospital,&#34; the subordinate responded quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;A hospital?&#34; The man arched one brow, a dark grin spreading across his face. &#34;Good. Let her breathe her last there, and we won&#39;t even have to get rid of her body ourselves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a respectful tone, the subordinate answered, &#34;Yes, sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man&#39;s voice grew colder. &#34;Make sure of it. And if you fail, don&#39;t bother returning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, the subordinate wiped the sweat from his forehead and replied quickly,&#34;understand,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Shoildon Primary Hospital, inside a top-floor VIP suite, silence filled the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse entered for the routine check of Katelyn&#39;s vitals. Spotting her asleep, she decided not to wake her and slipped out quietly once everything looked stable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The door clicked shut behind her, and moments later, the window eased open from the outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed head to toe in fitted black clothing, with their face hidden behind a mask, a shadowy figure vaulted inside with fluid, silent movements.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moving closer to the bed where Katelyn slept, the intruder slowly lifted an arm, a gleaming dagger sliding down from within the sleeve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The point of the weapon lined up perfectly with the vulnerable skin of Katelyn&#39;s neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside her dream, Katelyn suddenly felt the sting of something sharp driving toward her head, the sensation shocking her awake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes shot open to the sight of a cold blade hovering inches away, and terror ripped through her as she cried out,&#34;Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound made the intruder narrow their eyes before slashing the dagger toward her without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn tumbled off the bed in panic, hurling whatever objects she could grab in the intruder&#39;s direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every throw missed as the figure dodged with ease and advanced again, blade flashing as it swung a second time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Help! Somebody help me!&#34; Katelyn bolted toward the door, but just as her hand reached for the handle,a grip clamped down on her right arm and the dagger sliced across it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Ah!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Blood poured from her right arm in a steady stream. The sting of the cut was nothing compared to the terror clawing at her mind, and her legs buckled until she collapsed onto the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The intruder moved closer at a slow, deliberate pace, raising the dagger for another strike, when a whistle suddenly pierced the air and heavy footsteps thundered in the hallway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound, the intruder pulled, back the dagger, dashed toward the window, and vanished into the night without leaving a trace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Fuller, are you hurt?&#34; An officer shoved the door open, lifted Katelyn from the floor, and set her back on the bed while a nurse rushed in to dress the bleeding wound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged officer turned toward the open window, his brow furrowing.&#34;Who could move with such speed and skill?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another officer answered grimly, &#34;Climbing and escaping at this height would take the training of a professional killer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s gaze rested on the officers, her body trembling as the fear refused to leave her.Who was determined enough to want her dead? Every attempt so far made it clear they would not give up until she was gone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True fear gripped Katelyn this time. She seized the arm of the officer who had asked her questions earlier and begged, her voice breaking, &#34;Officer Collins, please protect me. These people are after my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo Collins gave a firm nod. &#34;Stay calm. We&#39;ll guard you and make sure they fail.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After coming back from the hospital, Danica kept replaying the words of both Verena and Katelyn in her mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Katelyn&#39;s account seemed more convincing on the surface, Danica still quietly leaned toward believing Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Katelyn had suffered an ordeal that left her pitiful in Danica&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One afternoon, Danica prepared several nourishing dishes and planned to deliver them to Katelyn at the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While she finished packing the food, Bobby descended the staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bobby,&#34; Danica called out as he came down. &#34;Katelyn is injured and staying in the hospital. Why don&#39;t you come with me to see her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby looked reluctant. &#34;But I already promised my friends I&#39;d meet them for billiards.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica tugged sharply at his ear. &#34;You can spend time with your friends whenever you want. Right now,Katelyn is injured, and she&#39;s been your friend since childhood. You ought to visit her, because in her heart she still treats you like a younger brother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shielded his ear and murmured in protest, &#34;She always followed Isaac around like a shadow. I never really spent time with her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica clicked her tongue in annoyance. &#34;Tsk! What was that you just said?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Worried she might reach for his other ear, Bobby gave in with reluctance. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll go.&#34; When they reached the hospital, Danica pushed the ward door open and was startled to find the same officer,Waldo,already seated inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s face showed confusion. &#34;Why is a police officer here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica moved closer and asked, &#34;Officer Collins, could you tell me what happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo gestured toward the window. &#34;Not long ago, someone climbed in with the intent to assassinate Miss Fuller. We managed to arrive in time to stop the worst, but she still ended up wounded.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As those words sank in, Danica&#39;s eyes turned to Katelyn. Her arm was wrapped in a bandage, yet fresh blood had already soaked through, and her complexion looked drained and fragile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn broke down with heavier sobs. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, do you still think I&#39;m lying? She truly wants me dead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby stayed frozen, not knowing what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica knitted her brows together but kept her silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She already realized that Katelyn hadn&#39;t fabricated this, because tricking the police would have been impossible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she could not bring herself to openly say that Verena might really be responsible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo looked through his notes before he asked Katelyn once more, &#34;Miss Fuller, are you certain Verena Willis is the only person who comes to mind as the suspect?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears ran down Katelyn&#39;s face as she nodded hard. &#34;No one else could have done this. She knows my hands are everything to me as a doctor. Now my arm has been cut, and I can&#39;t even say when it will heal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her crying worsened, and she buried her face in her hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shouted angrily, jabbing a finger at her, &#34;That&#39;s nonsense. Someone may be targeting you, but it has nothing to do with my sister-in-law. Verena is gentle and kind, and she would never stoop to that. Are you just accusing her because you dislike her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Bobby!&#34; Danica snapped as she yanked him to the side. &#34;You&#39;re getting more out of control with every</p>
                
                
                
                <p>passing day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waldo fixed him with a hard stare and spoke with firm authority. &#34;We&#39;re treating this as a proper investigation. Anyone with past ties to the victim can be seen as a suspect, so l expect your cooperation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At Seraphina Villas, Rhonda picked up a phone call, and her complexion drained of color at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her panic, she dashed upstairs, pounding on the study door without her usual restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena opened it, she looked surprised. &#34;Rhonda, what&#39;s wrong? Why are you so worked up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathless, Rhonda delivered the news. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, the police just called. They want you to come down to the station for questioning.&#34;</p>
