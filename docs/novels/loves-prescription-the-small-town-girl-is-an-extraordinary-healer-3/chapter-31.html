                <p>When the photographer came back, he asked Isaac and Verena to shift into a different pose.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He decided on a pose that felt straightforward and did not require much interaction between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Let&#39;s try to get the feeling right this time,&#34; he said aloud. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I want you to sit on Mr. Bennett&#39;s lap and loop your arms around his neck.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of &#34;lap,&#34; Isaac&#39;s brow tightened. His legs might hold steady enough, yet the weakness in them meant that even the smallest slip could send her tumbling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on to his discomfort, Verena chose not to bring up his legs and instead teased lightly, &#34;Relax, I&#39;m not that heavy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes lingered on her, and a quiet warmth stirred inside.She clearly understood his concern had nothing to do with her weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words were about to leave his lips when the photographer cut in, saying, &#34;Mr. Bennett, if you think she might slip, hold her back and steady her head with</p>
                
                
                
                <p>your hands.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could even register the instructions, Verena had perched sideways on his lap, her toes brushing against the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Isaac had no sensation in his legs, he never noticed that Verena was hardly placing her weight on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She slipped her slender arms around his neck, and her skin felt both cool and soft against him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The brush of her skin sent a sudden tension through him, and his hands moved instinctively to steady her back. His legs gave him nothing, but his chest could not ignore the warmth pressing against it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Balancing with the help of her legs, Verena leaned close enough that her upper body pressed against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he lowered his eyes, he caught the sweep of her lashes, the sharp line of her nose, and the bold color painted across herlips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So close to her now, lsaac breathed in a gentle fragrance, a sweetness that seemed to drift through the very air around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s it, wonderful!&#34; said the photographer as he kept giving instructions. &#34;Now lean in a bit closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his words, Verena tugged Isaac&#39;s head lower toward her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, Isaac found himself staring directly into her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not content yet, the photographer pushed them further, saying, &#34;Closer. Closer than that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On this attempt, Isaac leaned in without waiting,and before Verena could guide him, he was already close.A smile spread across her face, delighted by his initiative.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s expression struck the photographer as flawless, and he nearly clicked the shutter right then.Yet when his eyes shifted to lsaac, he spotted the stiffness in Isaac&#39;s posture.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photographer clicked his tongue thoughtfully and said, &#34;Let&#39;s try something else. Touch noses for me,show a little more closeness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a small nod and lifted her chin, brushing the tip of her nose against Isaac&#39;s.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena leaned closer, the photographer snapped the shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her shift made Isaac&#39;s lashes tremble, and the hand resting at her back gripped more firmly without him</p>
                
                
                
                <p>realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint wince crossed Verena&#39;s face as the pressure brushed against a bruise from earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly eased his hold and met her eyes with regret. &#34;I&#39;m sorry. Did I hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a calm shake of her head, unbothered. &#34;It&#39;s nothing. Let&#39;s keep going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her position steady, Verena stayed still while Isaac&#39;s thoughts drifted. &#34;Did I hurt you...&#34; The words echoed in his mind as if he had spoken them to someone once before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching his faraway look, Verena angled her head and, to her own surprise, pressed her lips against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her warm lips touched his cool ones, a fierce spark rushed through Isaac&#39;s thoughts like a sudden current.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Isaac forgot how to think or move,and only the steady throb in his neck reminded him that Verena had kissed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the scene unfold, the photographer&#39;s face lit with satisfaction, and he snapped the shot at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;These turned out better than l imagined.&#34; He stepped back,eyes gleaming with satisfaction as he studied the shots one by one.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of the photographer&#39;s praise, Verena eased back a little from lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While pulling back, she caught sight of something amusing. Isaac&#39;s ears burned red with shyness, yet his expression showed no trace of anger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The look on his face tempted Verena, and she decided to tease him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Following her playful impulse, she leaned in close,smiling as she whispered gently into his ear, &#34;You were the one who got distracted, so I had to think of something. Otherwise, the photographer would grow impatient. And hey, we&#39;re getting married soon, so this shouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal, right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came in a softened tone, and she tilted her head,looking straight into Isaac&#39;s eyes with a spark of mischief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A visible swallow moved along lsaac&#39;s throat as her gaze held him, and he quickly lowered his eyes. His voice, rougher than he noticed, came out as he murmured, &#34;Sure... it&#39;s fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena accepted his answer with a nod, let her teasing drop,and smiled while lifting herself from his lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After holding that posture for so long, her legs had gone numb, and her soles tingled sharply as though pierced by countless tiny needles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac saw the way she shifted her legs and caught the strain on her face, yet he chose not to ask about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that moment passed, the rest of the shoot moved along with unexpected ease, free from the serious look the photographer had stressed earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the session ended, the clock had slipped past ten in the evening. Isaac brought Verena home before telling the driver to continue on to the Bennett Mansion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, lsaac took the contract from his assistant&#39;s hand, but not a word on the page would stay in his mind. Instead, the memory of Verena&#39;s kiss kept replaying, the delicate warmth still lingering on his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught in that memory, Isaac&#39;s fingers drifted up and brushed his lips without him realizing it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant repeated Isaac&#39;s name more than once,but no answer came back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through the rearview mirror, the assistant noticed Isaac&#39;s fingers resting against his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a louder tone, he called out, &#34;Mr. Bennett,are your gums hurting?&#34; Startled out of his thoughts by the sudden volume,Isaac pulled his hand back and gripped the contract,saying, &#34;No, I.. only noticed a problem with the contract.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; The word &#34;problem&#34; sent a jolt of tension through the assistant. As he turned to look, his mouth hung open in disbelief. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you... the contract is upside down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac glanced down and saw the words printed upside down, he quickly adjusted the pages,as though snapping out of a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the shock on his assistant&#39;s face, Isaac cleared his throat and mumbled with unease, &#34;Today ...the photo shoot wore me out a little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assistant could hardly believe it. Wore him out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never before had he heard lsaac, the tireless workaholic, confess to exhaustion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though surprised, he gave a nod, silently recognizing the effort Isaac had made.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After they finished taking the pre-wedding photos,Verena started getting busy with other things.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During her time overseas, she began taking patients suited for traditional treatments. Along with the newcomers, she still kept in touch with her longtime patients for regular follow-ups</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On this particular day, Barrie was scheduled for his follow-up visit.</p>

When you attend,you must build connections with them. Do you understand?&#34;</p>
