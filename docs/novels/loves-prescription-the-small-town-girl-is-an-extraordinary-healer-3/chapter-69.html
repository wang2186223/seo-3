                <p>Good heavens! Could it truly be Dr. Willis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought struck Bobby like a bolt out of the blue,leaving him utterly dumbfounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He enlarged the photo again and again, scrutinizing every detail with disbelief. Though the picture was taken from behind, he was convinced that the woman Kaia mentioned-Verena-was none other than Dr.Willis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no point wasting time guessing.He would uncover the truth once he went to the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without wasting a moment, Bobby called Kaia, his excitement barely held in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the table, Kaia&#39;s phone lit up. When she noticed his name on the screen, the corners of her lips curled into a satisfied smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She answered leisurely, pressing the phone to her ear, her voice sweet and composed.&#34;Hello?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could say anything further, Bobby&#39;s anxious tone rushed in. &#34;Kaia, which bar is she at?Send me the address this instant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia complied without hesitation, forwarding the location to him. &#34;Done. Check the message.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby gave the address a quick glance, hurriedly changed clothes, grabbed his keys, and rushed downstairs. His voice was edged with urgency as he gave instructions. &#34;You&#39;re still at the bar, right? Do whatever it takes to keep Verena there. Don&#39;t let her slip away. I&#39;m on my way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tremor in his voice revealed how unsettled he truly was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia, however, felt a surge of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, Bobby was desperate to catch Verena in the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If Bobby confronted her, Verena&#39;s proud and unyielding nature would ensure an inevitable quarrel. And should someone &#34;accidentally&#34; record the spectacle in that bustling bar, word would spread like wildfire. Alec and Laura would not only be crushed by Verena&#39;s disgraceful behavior but also feel deeply humiliated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that moment, Kaia would shine as the only daughter worth relying upon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for the Bennett family, no matter how much lsaac might shield Verena, if both Danica and Bobby turned against her, then-even if shemanaged to marry into the Bennett household-her life would be nothing but walking on thorns.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In every sense, it was a plan that killed two birds with one stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glittered with a triumphant gleam,her smirk impossible to conceal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added softly to Bobby, &#34;Of course. I&#39;m not just helping you. She&#39;s still my sister, and I don&#39;t wish to watch her stumble down such a foolish path.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby dismissed her pretentious words without comment and hung up, tossing his keys to the driver.&#34;Aurora Bar. Quickly!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The driver caught the keys and bowed his head respectfully. &#34;Yes, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, they were on the road, the car speeding through the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s abrupt hang-up did not bother Kaia in the slightest. She was already savoring the image of Verena&#39;s downfall, and the mere thought was intoxicating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the back seat of the car, Bobby kept staring at the photos Kaia had sent, each passing glance strengthening his conviction-Verena was Dr.Willis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nervous sweat dampened his palms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to contain his emotions, he dialed Slater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a few rings, the call connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An irritated voice greeted him. &#34;Really, Bobby? Do you ever check the time before calling?&#34; Anyone woken from a dream would sound irritable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet Bobby paid no attention to Slater&#39;s annoyance,blurting out his excitement. &#34;Listen, Slater! You won&#39;t believe this. I&#39;ve stumbled on something extraordinary. Verena might actually be Dr. Willis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Slater thought Bobby was merely ranting and was ready to snap back, but the next words left him stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What nonsense are you spouting at this hour? Are you sure you&#39;re alright?&#34; Slater chuckled in disbelief.&#34;I was at the Willis residence just days ago and eliminated that possibility with my own eyes. And now you expect me to believe Verena is Dr. Willis?What is this, some kind of early/ April Fool&#39;s prank?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby, anticipating his skepticism, swiftly forwarded the three photos.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;m not joking. I&#39;m on my way to the bar right now.These were just taken. Look carefully at the woman-this is no mere coincidence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater opened one of the pictures absentmindedly- aordinary and froze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, silence reigned, until Bobby,thinking the call had dropped, called his name.Suddenly, a startled curse burst from Slater&#39;s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Good heavens! That silhouette, that profile-it does resemble Dr. Willis.&#34; Slater zoomed in repeatedly,nearly convinced it was her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, someone with Dr. Willis&#39; elegance and striking figure was far too rare for mere chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby arched a brow. &#34;See? I told you l wasn&#39;t spinning tales.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater leapt out of bed. &#34;Where are you now? Wait for me-I&#39;m coming to0.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby glanced out the window. &#34;I&#39;m just passing your street. I&#39;ll pick you up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater hurriedly threw on some clothes. &#34;Fine. I&#39;ll be waiting downstairs.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call ended, Bobby clutched his phone tightly, his chest swelling with a storm of emotions. If Verena truly was Dr. Willis,then all this time he had been speaking ill of her... Oh no!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the bar, Kaia brushed off the advances of a few men and declined her friends&#39; invitation to dance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remained seated, her gaze locked on the two figures by the counter, as if afraid they might vanish should she glance away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she sipped her drink, her eyes lingered on Verena with a mocking glint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Verena still leaned against the counter, unresponsive, while Gavin wore a troubled look. It was clear that none of his comforting words had reached her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He scratched his head and finally offered, &#34;Verena,believe me. With the way lsaac feels about you,he can&#39;t possibly cast you aside for good. You just need to raise the stakes, and he&#39;ll surely return to you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, drunk and weary, lifted her heavy head, her voice raspy. &#34;Raise the stakes? I can&#39;t bring myself to pressure him. And I&#39;ve already raised them enough by claiming I would be with other men if he let go,yet he still forced himself to ask me to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gavin clicked his tongue and leaned closer, lowering his voice. &#34;You still don&#39;t understand. Men may act tough, but when it truly matters, they discover their limits. Words alone won&#39;t break him-you need action. Give me your phone, I&#39;ll help you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Verena could object, Gavin had already taken her phone, unlocking it with her fingerprint. He opened the camera, leaned in close, and with a sharp click, captured a picture of himself beside her-her face and his half-body illuminated by the colorful lights of the bar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The photo radiated an intimacy that words alone could not conjure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena snatched her phone back, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. &#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Helping you raise the stakes, of course,&#34; Gavin replied, his tone brimming with strategy. &#34;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll send: type &#39;I&#39;m drunk. Are you certain youdon&#39;t want to come pick me up?&#39;-and attach this photo.&#34;</p>
