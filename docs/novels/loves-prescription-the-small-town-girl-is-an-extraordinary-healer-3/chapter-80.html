                <p>Bobby leaned over and grabbed the phone he had tossed aside earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His thumbs began flying across the keyboard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sat at the hotel room desk, wrapping up her work when her phone vibrated once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance at the screen showed a message from Bobby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dr. Willis, are you free tomorrow morning? I need to talk to you about something important. Can I come by?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered across Verena&#39;s face. The truth was, she and Bobby weren&#39;t close enough for private meetings yet.If anyone else had sent that message, she might have told them to text her or just call. Still,Bobby wasn&#39;t just anyone-he was lsaac&#39;s younger brother. Spending time with him felt a little like previewing her future family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved into a small smile as she responded, &#34;Sure, let&#39;s have breakfast together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single reply had Bobby grinning from ear to ear, his excitement practically spilling over. Without hesitation, he snapped a screenshot of the chat and forwarded it to Slater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Look at this! Did you see that? My future sister-in-law literally said she&#39;s taking me out for breakfast!&#34;Bobby wrote.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater responded immediately, &#34;What the hell, man? Tell me the truth-what did you do to Dr. Willis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Bobby fired off a cute nodding emoji to Verena, and then ignored Slater completely,enjoying how worked up his friend would get.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, he hopped off the bed and pulled open his closet, already thinking about what to wear.Meeting his future sister-in-law deserved nothing less than a strong first impression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning arrived. With his schedule lighter than usual, Isaac asked the driver to take him straight to Verena&#39;s hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only a couple of days had passed since they&#39;d seen each other at the bar, but for him, it already felt far longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they neared the hotel, Isaac had the car stop at the restaurant nearby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He remembered Verena once mentioned that this place served a great breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling himself inside, Isaac was quickly greeted by a waiter who guided him to a quiet corner and placed a menu in his hands.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes skimmed the list of dishes, but before he could order, a voice drifted through the partition. &#34;Dr.Willis, I&#39;m not late,am l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other sidecame Verena&#39;s gentle reply. &#34;No, I just arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s fingers curled against the menu. Bobby... with Verena? Why were they meeting?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown creased his forehead as confusion settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his silence, the waiter leaned in and suggested politely,our signature breakfast might interest you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping out of his thoughts, Isaac closed the menu and lowered his voice. &#34;I&#39;m sorry, something urgent came up. I&#39;ll have to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unfazed, the waiter kept his professional smile. &#34;Of course. We&#39;ll be happy to serve you next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Isaac moved his wheelchair toward the exit, he glanced sideways. Through the semi-transparent partition, he caught sight of Bobby and Verena seated across from one another.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on Bobby, dressed in a sharp suit with neatly styled hair-a look he rarely bothered with unless the event demanded it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Isaac&#39;s face stayed composed, his eyes stayed fixed on the pair. They were completely absorbed in conversation, never once noticing him watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>lsaac&#39;s hands pressed harder against the wheels before he pulled his eyes away and rolled out of therestaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he was back inside the car, the driver glanced at him through the rearview miror. &#34;Mr. Bennett, shouldwe go straight to Miss Willis&#39; hotel now?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lifting his gaze only slightly, lsaac gave him a faint look before turning toward the window. &#34;No. Take mehome.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met briefly, and the driver shivered, though the car&#39;s heater was running strong.He quickly nodded.&#34;Understood, Mr. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, the car pulled away from the curb and left the restaurant behind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut into her breakfast, noticing the young man across from her stealing quick glances</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby nearly got caught and ducked his head at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A laugh slipped from Verena as she asked, &#34;Why are you sneaking looks at me like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She added playfully, &#34;Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s because l skipped makeup today and look awful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby shook his head with force. &#34;Not at al! My perfect sis... um... Dr. Wilis, you&#39;re honestly the mostbeautiful woman l&#39;ve ever met- swear l&#39;m telling the truth!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words &#34;perfect sister-in-law&#34; nearly spilled before he bit down and stopped himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated for a moment, and then let a small smile form. &#34;| believe you.&#34; For a few seconds, Bobby couldn&#39;t take his eyes off her. Her quiet warmth left him feeling guilty</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, his thoughts spiraled. This was the same woman he had gone out of his way to reject, yet she was sokind, so patient-and she had even saved him. Stil, he had slandered her to her future husband and mother-in-law. What kind of monster did that make him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>at most In his mind, a shadowy figure seemed to hover above, tallying up every one of his mistakes. Groaning, Bobby dragged his hands through his hair as his face turned bright red right there at the table.</p>
