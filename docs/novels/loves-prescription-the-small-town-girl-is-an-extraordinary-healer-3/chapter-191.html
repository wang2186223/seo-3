                <p>At the Fuller residence...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the television, the media was busy broadcasting the shocking revelation of Verena&#39;s hidden identity as Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sound was muted, leavingonly the flickering images dancing silently across the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn sat rigidly on the sofa, jaw clenched,eyes locked on the screen as though she could burn holes through the images.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The news of Verena being Evelyn had already spread like wildfire,becoming the talk on every lip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn was certain now-her disguise as Evelyn must have been unmasked before Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again,so what? Until she left Akoitha for good, Kaia was still a pawn she could move.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching at that thought, Katelyn reached for the phone on the table and dialed a number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia, her face hidden in trembling hands, was weeping when the sudden ring of her phone cut through her cries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she saw the caller ID, her tears boiled into fury. Gritting her teeth, she hissed out the name with bitterness, &#34;Katelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec and Laura were both at homne. Kaia couldn&#39;t risk a soul overhearing her dealings with Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering the receiver, she slipped away into the back garden, choosing a shadowed corner before answering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia, I need you to do me one last favor.&#34; Katelyn&#39;s voice spilled through before Kaia could even breathe a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That tone-sharp, commanding-dragged Kaia back to all the times she had been fooled into obedience.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anger erupted, and she roaed, &#34;Katelyn Fuller! I haven&#39;t even hunted you down yet, and you dare call me first? Tell me, was I nothing but a tool from the start? You&#39;re no Evelyn! You tricked me-used me!And now you expect help? I swear to you, that&#39;s impossible!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The only reason she had ever stood by Katelyn was her belief that Katelyn was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had it not been for that lie, Kaia would never have touched her shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet in the end, she had been duped into harming the very person she once held in admiration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Kaia&#39;s fury, Katelyn&#39;s lips twisted into a deranged smile. A laugh tore out-shrill and cutting,enough to send ice through Kaia&#39;s veins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s brow furrowed deeply. &#34;Are you insane?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suppressing her laughter, Katelyn answered coldly,&#34;Yes, I used you. I&#39;m not Evelyn. Verena is Evelyn. But tell me-does it change anything?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice slowed, laced with temptation. &#34;Kaia, have you forgotten the humiliation she dealt you? Do you not recall whose hands pushed you out of your own home? She was merciless toward you. Will you still pity her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Against her will, Kaia&#39;s mind began to replay those bitter memories as Katelyn&#39;s words coiled in her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katelyn&#39;s gaze never left Verena&#39;s image glowing on the television.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed on, &#34;Listen carefully, Kaia. Help me just this once, and you help yourself. I promise you,Verena will vanish from this world without a trace.True, I may not be your idol, but we both share the same enemy-shouldn&#39;t we stand as one against her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Vanish from this world without a trace?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s grip tightened on the phone, her focus  wavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped to a whisper. &#34;She won&#39;t trust me anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Katelyn&#39;s eyes glittered with a sly smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia,the fool, had taken the bait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s lips curved as she answered slowly, &#34;She won&#39;t trust you, but she loves Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia stiffened.&#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s voice turned to steel. &#34;Tomorrow, I&#39;ll keep Isaac occupied. You only need to tell Verena you saw him being forced into a car-and that I was in the same car. Then you lead her to the abandoned factory on the outskirts.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s heart sank with the realization. &#34;You&#39;re planning to kidnap her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn sidestepped the question, her tone low and cold. &#34;Kaia, trust me. Once she&#39;s gone, you&#39;ll stand as the sole daughter of the Willis family. Soon, the disgrace she branded on you will vanish like smoke in the wind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Kaia fell into silence, the pause stretching like an eternity. Katelyn gave a faint smile.&#34;Don&#39;t be anxious. I&#39;m not forcing your hand. Think it through, and then give me your answer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The steady beeps rang in Kaia&#39;s ear, yet she stood frozen, eyes distant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Questions churned in her chest like a storm. What path should she take?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t she already stumbled far enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Would following Katelyn again not be a step deeper into.a trap?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was kidnapping. It was murder. CouId anyone walk away from that unscathed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And above all-Verena was Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could she truly raise a hand against Evelyn?</p>
