                <p>Verena made her way to a local café later that afternoon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She spotted Wendell already sitting at the reserved table, his posture stiff and his fingers locked together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an understanding smile, she approached and slid into the chair opposite him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re early, Professor Branson,&#34; Verena remarked as she settled in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s nerves were obvious as soon as he saw her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He managed a shaky grin. &#34;I actually just arrived a moment ago.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the tension that filled the space between them, Verena jumped straight to the point.&#34;Katelyn Fuller reached out to you, didn&#39;t she?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she said it left no room for doubt-it wasn&#39;t a question, but a fact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned by how quickly she&#39;d put it together, Wendell hesitated, and then exhaled slowly. &#34;No one ever gets anything past you,do they?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her arms resting gently on the table, Verena continued, &#34;So, what did Katelyn do to convince you to help her lie?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Under the table, Wendell&#39;s hands clenched tighter. &#34;She invited me under the pretense of a friendly meeting, but when I got there, I realized it was a setup. She spoke about a patient she was desperate to treat,but said the family needed convincing first. She wanted me to vouch for her by saying she was Evelyn.I know you too well to let anyone impersonate you, soI refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words trailed off as he glanced at Verena, and then dropped his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But then..&#34; His voice cracked with a weary sigh. &#34;She threatened my family. She mentioned my grandson,my son, and my daughter-in-law. Evelyn, I never wanted to lie, but I couldn&#39;t put them at risk. So I caved.She brought me to the family, and I said what she wanted me to say.&#34; Embarrassment crepot up Wendell&#39;s face as he spoke, his cheeks reddening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A calm assurance floated across the table from Verena. &#34;You don&#39;t need to worry about any of it,&#34; she said gently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That response caught Wendell off guard, leaving him confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He searched her face for any sign of anger, but found only steady, clear eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned in and continued, &#34;Professor Branson, I&#39;Il make sure nothing happens to your family. You,your grandson, your son, and your daughter-in-law are all safe with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell was stunned by what he heard and needed a moment before he responded. &#34;Evelyn, aren&#39;t you upset with me for pretending you were someone else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, Verena shook her head. &#34;The patient Katelyn is desperate to treat is actually my husband.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That bit of news made Wendell&#39;s eyes go wide. &#34;That&#39;s... I can hardly believe it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded again. &#34;What&#39;s done is done, Professor. You shouldn&#39;t feel responsible or carry any guilt.I promise, your family will be looked after.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more composed and forgiving Verena seemed, the heavier Wendell&#39;s shame became. He tried to speak,but couldn&#39;t find the right words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere in the café, a man wearing a black jacket watched their table, a phone pressed to his ear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Speaking in a low voice, he reported, &#34;Miss Fuller, Wendel is with Verena right now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s quiet chuckle traveled down the line. &#34;Understood. Don&#39;t lose track of them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once that call ended, she immediately dialed another number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica answered after a moment. &#34;Hello, Katelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle voice, Katelyn asked, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, have you already talked to Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That question reignited Danica&#39;s earlier frustration from her conversation with Verena. Her reply came out flat and annoyed. &#34;I visited her this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn didn&#39;t let the tension faze her. &#34;When you saw her, did you let her know that Professor Branson confirmed I&#39;m Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming Katelyn doubted how clearly she&#39;d explained things, Danica snapped, &#34;I told her everything she needed to hear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hint of a sly smile flickered across Katelyn&#39;s face. She put on a slightly anxious tone. &#34;That explains a lot.While I was out having coffee today, I spotted Verena too. I was about to go over and say hello, but...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her words hang in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica couldn&#39;t help herself. &#34;What happened next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn picked up the story right away. &#34;I saw her sitting with Professor Branson. They looked pretty deep in conversation. Mrs. Bennett, she heard about him from you just this morning and now she&#39;s talking with him.What if she&#39;s trying to keep me away from lsaac by convincing Professor Branson to say I&#39;m not really Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica cut her off, firm in her conviction. &#34;That&#39;s not possible. Verena wouldn&#39;t do something like that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica standing up for Verena brought a flicker of jealousy to Katelyn&#39;s eyes, though she kept her tone sweet. &#34;You never know what people are capable of. Verena worked hard to become part of your family, and she&#39;s got a lot to lose. Honestly, I&#39;d feel threatened in her shoes too. Wanting to protect her place is only natural. Still, it&#39;s not right to play dirty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica weighed those words in silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even if she felt frustrated with Verena, she wasn&#39;t quick to jump to conclusions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mind drifted back to what Rhonda had said during her earlier visit. Danica let the thought sit before she finally replied, &#34;I don&#39;t pretend to know Verena inside and out, but every time l&#39;ve dealt with her, she&#39;s struck me as someone with integrity.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn noticed that Danica&#39;s words, though calm, seemed to lean in Verena&#39;s favor, which left her feeling uneasy. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, are you sure about this...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could finish, Danica chimed in, &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be watching Verena closely. No matter what disagreements come up or how much pushback I get, I&#39;ll make certain isaac receives your care. I&#39;m prepared to keep after him until he agrees to the surgery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That unwavering determination finally eased Katelyn&#39;s mind. She arched her brows and gave a genuine smile. &#34;That&#39;s exactly what I wanted to hear, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later that night, after Verena finished Isaac&#39;s treatment, the two of them took turns showering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was still work left on Isaac&#39;s plate, so he stayed at his desk until almost midnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when he closed his laptop and left the study did he realize the bedroom was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of panic passed through him as he paused at the doorway. Just as he considered calling her name,a cooI night breeze drifted in from the wide balcony, sending the sheer curtains floating through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking up, Isaac spotted Verena at the railing, her back turned toward him, eyes on the sky.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a soft champagne nightgown that almost disappeared against the pale curtains-no wonder he missed her at first glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought made Isaac laugh quietly at himself. His instinctive worry at not finding her had completely thrown him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying his nerves, he took another look at her graceful outline. &#34;Couldn&#39;t sleep?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That gentle question made Verena glance over her shoulder, a playful smile lighting up her face. &#34;I&#39;m waiting for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was teasing, and as the wind swept through, her hair fluttered around her shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The unexpected sweetness left Isaac speechless for a mnoment, but he couldn&#39;t stop himself from smiling back. He rolled his chair to her side, feeling a quiet warmth settle between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slipped onto his lap, and Isaac instinctively drew her closer,his arms tightening around her waist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her palms cradied his face as she put on an exaggerated pout. &#34;Working all day at the office and then bringing it home too? Such a pitiful man.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Isaac could respond, she leaned in with a playful sigh. &#34;But it&#39;s fine, because this pitiful man belongs to me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her teasing tone and mischievous sweetness made Isaac&#39;s chest rumble with a quiet laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t move,&#34; Verena remarked gently, tilting his head up. &#34;I&#39;m giving you a massage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingers pressed against his temples, easing the tight knots of fatigue until the tension started to melt away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon, though, her hands began exploring further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her delicate fingers glided along his brow, and she murmured softly, &#34;Isaac, your eyebrows are so full, and the shape of your brow bone is so striking.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her fingertips drifted down to the bridge of his nose. &#34;And this nose-straight, sharp, like it was carved on purpose.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small laugh escaped her as her attention slid lower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But your lips,&#34; she whispered with a dreamy look, tracing them lightly. &#34;Those are my favorite. Soft, warm,and far too tempting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried like a gentle song, playful yet tender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac studied her closely, captivated by the faint blush on her cheeks, the hazy shimmer in her eyes, and the natural flush of her lips. There was even the faintest trace of wine on her breath, leaving her somewhere between sober and tipsy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand caught her wrist with quiet firmness. &#34;Did you drink?&#34; Holding up two fingers, Verena grinned. &#34;Just two glasses.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac tilted his head, his voice low. &#34;Something troubling you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave him a sly smile. &#34;Who says it has to be trouble? Maybe I was drinking because I was happy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He accepted her answer with a soft nod. &#34;Then tell me, what was it that made you so happy?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curved in a mischievous grin. &#34;That&#39;s for me to know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she leaned forward and captured his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no resisting her charm-Isaac never stood a chance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Completely undone, he cupped her face in both hands and deepened the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Above them, the night sky glittered with countless stars, while the evening wind stirred the trees with a gentle rustle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the balcony of the villa, their embrace painted a picture that could have been lifted straight from a dream.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hungry for more, Isaac clung to her like a boy unwilling to let go of his favorite toy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, out of nowhere, Verena pressed both hands against his shoulders and broke away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he tried to close the distance again, she pushed a little firmer, holding him back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He breathed heavily, his voice coming out rough. &#34;What&#39;s wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes softened, though her tone carried weight. &#34;Isaac, I need your word on something. Don&#39;t ask why,just promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though confusion lingered, he didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;You have my word.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her expression grew serious. &#34;Whatever your mother tells you, don&#39;t agree to let someone else take over your treatment. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want you to get better faster-I just can&#39;t put faith in someone willing to do anything to get their way.&#34; Isaac&#39;s sharp mind connected the dots at once. &#34;Did Katelyn cross a line with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated, choosing not to give him a direct answer. &#34;She went to Professor Wendell Branson and forced him to back her up, claiming she&#39;s Evelyn Rowe. Your mother believed her. She came to me asking that I step aside so Katelyn could treat you, but I refused.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze turned grim. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Danica tries to pressure you into it herself. You&#39;ll need to be ready.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together in frustration. &#34;Katelyn is out of her mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s tone sharpened. &#34;And there&#39;s more. Katelyn threatened Professor Branson, so make sure his family,especially his grandson, is protected.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave a firm nod. &#34;This mess started because of me. I&#39;ll see to their safety personally.&#34;</p>
