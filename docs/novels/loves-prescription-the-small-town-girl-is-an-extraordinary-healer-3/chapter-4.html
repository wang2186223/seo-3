                <p>As she walked, Laura whispered to Verena, &#34;No one needs to know you never made it past secondary school.Just tell them you graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. That&#39;s the story. Got it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had no desire to bother her with a reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Upon reaching the reserved room, Laura fixed her hair and straightened her clothes while Verena raised her hand and knocked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Danica heard someone knocking at the door, she knew the eldest daughter of the Willis family had arrived. This was the marriage arrangement she had personally set in motion. Now, as Isaac was about to meet Verena, emotions twisted inside her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was a time when Isaac had been her greatest pride. If that accident had never happened, he would be standing next to the most accomplished woman, not someone without much education.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Conflicting thoughts tugged at Danica. She couldn&#39;t bear the idea of others looking down on her son,yet she disliked the Willis family for trading their daughter&#39;s future for money.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come in,&#34; Danica instructed, her voice leaving no room for hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Verena turned the handle and stepped into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The eyes of both Danica and Isaac immediately settled on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s outfit was plain-a loose sweatshirt with comfortable pants.Her hair was tied back, though a few strands brushed against her forehead. Minimal makeup left her features untouched, but her beauty was impossible to overlook. Among Shoildon&#39;s most polished ladies, she would still draw attention. She carried herself with a calm assurance that made her presence hard to ignore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a brief second, Danica just stared, surprise and admiration flashing in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brow furrowed instead. &#34;So... you&#39;re from the Willis family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s words came out with a hint of uncertainty, and Laura edged her way inside from behind Verena.Wearing an eager smile, she responded, &#34;Good evening, Danica. That&#39;s me. Laura.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura guided Verena forward with a bright smile. &#34;This is my daughter, Verena Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s look of surprise was impossible to miss, and Laura felt a wave of satisfaction. Verena carried Alec&#39;s features, and that face was something worth showing off. It comforted Laura to know her eldest daughter still had qualities that made her proud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, is it?&#34; asked Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She studied the young woman&#39;s striking beauty and the confidence she carried. Nothing about her matched Bobby&#39;s claim that she was&#34;110t exactly attractive.&#34; If this was considered.unattractive, then Shoildon would have no beautiful women left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of satisfaction passed through Danica&#39;s.eyes. She was relieved to find the woman didn&#39;t match Bobby&#39;s unflattering description.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She still wanted a daughter-in-law who was easy to control and wouldn&#39;t go around exposing Isaac&#39;s issues in bed, but she also hoped the girl wouldn&#39;t be plain-looking. Appearances mattered, and whoever married into the family had to look the part.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reading the satisfaction in Danica&#39;s expression, Laura felt a quiet surge of pride. Verena was her own flesh and blood, and when it came to looks, se easily outshone Shoildon&#39;s most polished ladies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes. Danica, this is Verena,&#34; Laura repeated warmly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Please, have a seat...&#34; Danica&#39;s voice softened slightly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While the two mothers traded polite remarks, Verena&#39;s attention shifted to Isaac seated across from her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wore a simple black shirt and sat in a wheelchair with a light blanket draped over his legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching her eyes on his legs, Isaac&#39;s fingers tightened over his knees, but his expression stayed steady and distant, as if her glance carried no weight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When their gazes locked, Verena showed no sign of discomfort. Instead, she gave him a poised smile. Even in a wheelchair, he was exactly as she remembered. He was cool, unyielding, and commanding in presence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they looked at each other, Danica motioned for Laura and Verena to take their seats.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura praised Verena like she was describing a rare gem, stressing her merits in case Danica harbored any doubts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica felt entirely satisfied with what she saw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t help but find something unpleasant about the way Laura kept pushing her daughter forward. It felt less like introducing a future bride and more like showing off something for sale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The reality was that lsaac&#39;s legs were already in a poor condition, and even though the Bennett family remained wealthy and influential, he wasn&#39;t the best choice for a husband.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By lowering Verena&#39;s position so much, Laura gave the impression she didn&#39;t care if her daughter ended up looked down upon or mistreated, as long as the marriage into the Bennett family happened. To Danica, such a mother was hard to respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Verena and Isaac saying barely a word between them, it fell on Danica and Laura to keep the conversation going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After several minutes of small talk, Danica finally asked Verena, &#34;Miss Willis, your mother told me you hold a master&#39;s degree from Acorith College of Medicine. Is that right?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This detail mattered to Danica. Having a doctor in the family would make caring for lsaac far more manageable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the question left Danica&#39;s lips, Laura grew tense. She feared Verena would stubbornly deny it,so she gave her daughter a discreet nudge under the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura thought no one would notice, yet both Danica and Isaac caught the movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint line formed between Danica&#39;s brows, while Isaac&#39;s cold, impassive gaze remained unchanged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena raised her head, set her utensils down with steady hands, and gently dabbed her mouth with a napkin before answering, &#34;No.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s face lost some of its warmth, and Laura&#39;s expression shifted sharply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inwardly, Laura fumed. Damn it, Verena was still as rigid as ever. Why couldn&#39;t she think on her feet? Did she have to embarrass her like this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her anger nearly boiled over, but she forced herself to hold it in andprepare a way to salvage the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could speak, Verena added, &#34;I graduated from Pine Hill University.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes widened, and her face went through several changes. Pine Hill University was one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, and the revelation left her momentarily stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, on the other hand, stayed steady, her expression showing no hint of disturbance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s frustration nearly boiled over. She had always known Verena had grown up in a less refined place,but she hadn&#39;t expected her to be so bold in making up stories.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Claiming a degree from Acorith College of Medicine was already stretching the truth, yet now she dared to say she had graduated from Pine Hill University? Did Verena really think the people here would believe such a thing? Her lie had no shred of credibility.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s surprise showed in her eyes. She looked from Verena to Laura&#39;s stiff, uneasy face, and in that moment, something clicked. The realization brought a deeper crease to her brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac kept his gaze on Verena, and she responded with another gentle smile. It was warm, inviting, and carried the freshness of early spring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That single smile lightened Isaac&#39;s mood in a way he couldn&#39;t explain. He quickly turned away, his brows knitting together as a strange wave of self-consciousness washed over him-not because she was outstanding, but because her kindness made him feel small in an ufamiliar way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Attending Pine Hill University is certainly impressive. You must be very talented,&#34; Danica said, her tone cold and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Graduates from Pine Hill University stood among the most gifted people in the world, and calling them merely talented hardly did them justice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura realized Danica had already caught on to the lie, but she forced herself to press forward. &#34;Ha-ha, yes,it&#39;s very impressive. I must have gotten things mixed up... confusing it with the school Kaia will be attending.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The exchange left the dining table steeped in uncomfortable silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without any more hesitation, Danica said, &#34;I&#39;m very pleased with Verena, and I&#39;m sure lsaac is as well.Regarding the marriage agreement...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mom,&#34; Isaac chimed in, stopping her before she could finish.</p>
