                <p>Isaac&#39;s words settled in the air, and Jacob offered a small nod. After a moment&#39;s hesitation, he spoke up.&#34;Mr.Bennett, when this gets out, Sherwood&#39;s going to lose his mind. If he panics, he might get reckless.Should we be preparing for what he might do next?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac dismissed the concern with a wave of his hand,his voice steady. &#34;Let him stew. Sherwood&#39;s already backed into a corner. The more he freaks out, the more he&#39;ll slip up. All we have to do is sit tight and watch him unravel. As soon as the news hits, he&#39;ll bend over backward to keep Howe from saying a word.That desperation will show his real face soon enough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thoughtful look crossed Jacob&#39;s face before he nodded again. &#34;That makes sense,Mr. Bennett. I&#39;ll handle the arrangements right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Jacob spun on his heel and hurried out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Efficiency was one of Jacob&#39;s strengths. Word of Howe&#39;s so-called plan quickly reached Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>True to Isaac&#39;s prediction, the news threw Sherwood into a frenzy. Already rattled by Howe&#39;s sudden disappearance,Sherwood felt as if the ground had been ripped out from under him. He was painfully aware that if Howe talked to the police, the Sampson family would destroy him, and his reputation would be left in ruins.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The realization left Sherwood teetering between panic and rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pacing his office, he locked his hands behind his back,each step striking the floor with a forceful thud.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes, dark with frustration, burned with spite as he muttered to himself, &#34;Howe Adams,you backstabber.After everything l&#39;ve done for you, this is how you repay me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood suddenly stopped in his tracks and punched in a number on his phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the call connected, he asked, &#34;Did you track him down yet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His subordinate&#39;s voice trembled through the receiver.&#34;Mr. Kirk, Howe&#39;s slipped through every net we&#39;ve thrown out. We&#39;ve searched everywhere-there&#39;s no sign of him. We&#39;re going to need more time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Time?&#34; Sherwood&#39;s voice exploded, his fist crashing onto the desk. The force sent documents flying and coffee sloshing dangerously close to the edge. &#34;I don&#39;t care what it costs,&#34; he barked,the words sharp as knives. &#34;I want Howe found, no matter what it takes.Bring him to me-alive or dead. And hear me-if he opens his mouth, not one of you will walk away unscathed!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The subordinate stammered a promise, barely managing to squeak out a reply under Sherwood&#39;s blistering rage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood yanked his tie loose, trying to breathe past his anger. &#34;Put your best people on the police station.I want eyes everywhere. If anything changes, you let me know first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nervous affirmation crackled through the line before he ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the outskirts of Ochrerayd, a dull house sat shrouded in gloom, the air inside heavy with tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe slumped on the sofa, fatigue etched into every line of his face. His hair stuck up in wild tufts, and deep shadows ringed his eyes-a testament to too many restless nights.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gabby peered anxiously through the curtains before turning to him. &#34;It&#39;s been five days, love. We&#39;re completely in the dark out here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Howe rose and crossed the room to her, offering a reassuring hand. &#34;We&#39;re walking a razor&#39;s edge, Gabby.Isaac&#39;s the only one who can keep us safe now.Sherwood won&#39;t stop hunting us, but as long as we stick to Isaac&#39;s plan, we have a chance.&#34;</p>
