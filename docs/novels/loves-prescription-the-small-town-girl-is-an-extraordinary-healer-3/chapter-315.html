            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>As Sherwood watched Verena step down from the stage,his eyes lit up with delight. Straightening his suit,he wore a gentle, welcoming smile and hurried forward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis caught sight of him and offered a polite greeting.&#34;Mr.Kirk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood gave a light nod in return, though his gaze remained fixed on Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The past year, he had been convalescing in his hometown,far removed from the noise of the outside world. News had scarcely reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thus, he never imagined that Verena was none other than Evelyn-the miracle healer spoken of with awe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Approaching Verena, his expression held the warmth of an elder admiring the younger generation,his face glowing with approval. &#34;I heard your speech on stage,Verena. For someone so young, you carry such resolve. You&#39;ve truly brought honor to the Sampson family-an eye-opener indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then turned to Luis with a smile. &#34;Luis, your sister is  remarkable. She shines in medicine, and with her talent, she will also carve her place in business soon.For her,the sky is the limit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To seal his praise, Sherwood raised a thumbs-up,admiration shining through with a touch of imperceptible flattery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a faint nod, quietly agreeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes softened as they rested on Verena, carying both affection and care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed,Verena is outstanding,&#34; Luis said. &#34;But she has endured more than her share of hardship. Now that she is finally home, all I wish for is her peace. Nothing else matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the concern in his gaze, and warmth surged in her heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gently pressed his arm, wordlessly assuring him that she was fine, and that he didn&#39;t need to worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Sherwood, however, she felt an unease. His gaze seemed to hold more than the kindly affection of an elder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something else flickered beneath, though she could not name it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pushing the thought aside, Verena managed a modest  smile, her manner poised between courtesy and restraint. &#34;You are too generous. I haven&#39;t even touched the world of business yet-that&#39;s for the future. Medicine, though, has always been my calling and my strongest ground.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this, Sherwood leaned in slightly,his tone earnest.&#34;Verena, I must speak plainly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a weary breath, his features etched with fatigue. &#34;I&#39;ve been back in my hometown for over a year because I was diagnosed with cancer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; brows drew together at the revelation. Until now,he had only known Sherwood was unwell, not that it was cancer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sherwood pressed on, his sigh heavy. &#34;It&#39;s a reversible form, but extremely difficult. I have sought out famed doctors to no avail. Only Evelyn-the miracle healer -could save me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at Verena, lowering his gaze briefly before continuing, &#34;For a year, I pulled every string I could,searching high and low for Evelyn, but without success.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his eyes lifted again, bright with sudden hope.&#34;Only today have I discovered that you are the very Evelyn I sought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing a hand on her shoulder, he spoke with quiet  urgency. &#34;Verena, would you be willing to treat my illness?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though his demeanor still struck her as slightly odd,the compassion of a healer outweighed her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Besides, Luis had told her more than once that,during her years of absence, Sherwood had extended great help to the Sampson family, carrying them through difficult storms.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That kindness was not something she could forget.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause of reflection, Verena smiled warmly and gave a solemn nod. &#34;Mr. Kirk,healing the sick is my duty. Once you return home, send me your medical records. I&#39;ll study them carefully and devise a treatment plan that suits you best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words,relief washed over Sherwood.He gently patted her shoulder, gratitude written all over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Verena,&#34; he said earnestly. &#34;You&#39;re nothing less than my lifesaver.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze then shifted to Isaac, wo until now had kept silent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the CEO of Bennett Group, Isaac&#39;s influence in Shoildon&#39;s business circles was formidable. To have him as an ally was no small advantage. Yet the Kirk family, too, carried weight. Sherwood knew he had to tread carefully-showing neither servility nor arrogance-while seizing the chance to strengthen ties.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With practiced poise, he smiled warmly. &#34;Mr. Bennett,it is an honor to finally meet you. I&#39;ve long admired your accomplishments in business. Even an old man like me cannot help but be impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes narrowed slightly, brimming with approval.&#34;Truly, the younger generation outshines the older.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He then patted Isaac&#39;s shoulder with deliberate ease,striking a tone of dignity mixed with cordiality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, though never one to chase unnecessary bonds,recognized the goodwill Sherwood had shown to the Sampson family, and the fact that Verena was part of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason alone, he returned the courtesy with a polite smile. &#34;Mr. Kirk, thank you for the kind words.You&#39;re close to Verena&#39;s family. Please, just call me Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice carried neither warmth nor distance-measured, respectful, yet keeping a boundary clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Sherwood, sharp as ever, had already noticed how often Isaac mentioned Verena. From that alone, he  discerned where Isaac&#39;s heart lay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To win Isaac over, going through Verena was the best way. At the thought, his smile broádened as his gaze softened upon her. &#34;Verena, it is a joy to see you safely returned, and with such a devoted husband.Iam truly glad for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, his tone tinged with apology. &#34;I&#39;ve been away for treatment so long that I&#39;ve neglected to visit your parents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As he spoke, his expression shifted, struck by a sudden thought. His eyes flicked between Luis and Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Brightening with enthusiasm, he proposed, &#34;Why don&#39;t we take this chance, now that both families are here,to share a lively meal together?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis considered briefly before nodding. &#34;You are right.It has been far too long since our home felt this lively.My parents will be overjoyed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so, the plan for a family dinner was set.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the party drew to a close and the guests began to drift away, three SUVs soon pulled up outside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their headlights cut through the night as they departed together, bound for Sampson Villa.</p>
