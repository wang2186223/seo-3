                <p>A moment later, the call connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the other end came a deep, steady voice. &#34;What do you need me to look into?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel, a private detective Verena had relied on for years, was one of the few people she trusted without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They spoke with the ease of old comrades-direct, efficient, and without wasted words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her voice, Verena said, &#34;I need you to investigate someone. His name is Carl Aguilar. A year ago,he was discharged from my hospital in Clokron. I&#39;ve had no contact with him since, but I must know his background and his whereabouts after that. I saved him during the riots, and we barely interacted, so l know little about his life. That may make things harder for you, but please gather as much as you can. Don&#39;t worry -your efforts will be compensated the same, no matter the result.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Samuel gave a low chuckle, half in jest.&#34;After all these years, I&#39;ve weathered storms and handled hundreds of cases like this. If | weren&#39;t capable, I wouldn&#39;t still be standing in this business. Rest easy-it&#39;s in good hands.&#34; Verena replied, &#34;Alright. I&#39;Il be waiting for your good news.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her words ended, she stepped through the revolving doors of the restaurant-and halted.Someone was standing directly in her path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her gaze.&#34;Dr. Moss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon, dressed casually, greeted her with a twinkle in his eye..</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adjusting his glasses, he spoke warmly. &#34;Evelyn, what a surprise. I didn&#39;t expect it to truly be you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena ended the call and slipped her phone back into her coat pocket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wasn&#39;t sure whether Simon had overheard her earlier words. Maybe not, since she had spoken softly and finished before crossing the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out of courtesy, Verena gave a polite nod and a faint smile. &#34;Are you here for breakfast too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though simple, the curve of her lips carried a brightness that outshone mere politeness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s eyes flashed briefly with a hunger he struggled to conceal. He longed to draw her close.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching his jaw, he forced that desire into silence, masking it with a gentle smile. &#34;Yes. I&#39;ve heard this place serves an excellent breakfast. Would you join me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excitement shimmered in his eyes, his lips curving into a hopeful arc.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unaware of the emotion flickering behind his gaze, Verena shook her head. &#34;I&#39;ve already eaten, but enjoy your meal, Dr.Moss.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned to go, but Simon quickly called out, &#34;Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, curiosity in her expression.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping forward while keeping a respectful distance, Simon smiled warmly.11|wanted to ask about Mr.0Bennett&#39;s condition. He hasn&#39;t come for therapy these past days. Is there another plan, or does he not trust my abilities?&#34; Simon already knew Isaac&#39;s vigilance against him was the real reason.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He only sought an excuse to prolong his talk with Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, Verena answered smoothly, &#34;You were chosen by me personally, so your abilities are unquestionable. It&#39;s just that my husband&#39;s condition cannot be rushed. A period of rest at home may be better for his recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at her phone, she added apologetically, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but I have to go now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon leaned forward eagerly.&#34;Let me give you a ride.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She shook her head gently.&#34;NO,,thank you...&#34; But before she could finish, a voice cut in from the side. &#34;Hey, my dear Verena...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena turned. &#34;Ivan, what are you doing out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring her question, Ivan first sized up Simon. &#34;And who might this be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena made the introductions. &#34;This is Dr. Simon Moss, a new psychologist at our hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she turned toward Simon. &#34;This is my friend, Ivan Calderon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s gaze lingered a fraction too long on Ivan, jealousy sparking before he smoothed it away with his practiced gentleness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inclined his head with a polite smile. &#34;Nice to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan, outwardly charming yet cautious with strangers, responded with a cool nod and a faint smile-acknowledging the courtesy, nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he looked back to Verena, answering the question she&#39;d asked earlier. &#34;You wondered why/I came out here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He grinned, shaking his head in playful exasperation.&#34;YOu forgot your handbag. Lucky for you,l&#39;ve got sharp eyes.&#34;	 He handed her the bag, which she accepted with a smile. &#34;Right-you do have eagle eyes indeed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan puffed up at once, resting an elbow lightly on her shoulder as he boasted,f course.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their laughter spilled out easily, filling the air with warmth and harmony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon stood silently aside, watching, the sound of their laughter cutting deep into his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes blazed with jealousy, fists clenching so tightly his knuckles whitened. He struggled to control the surge of frustration within him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So unfair!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why could Ivan share her laughter? Why could Isaac have her? Verena had drawn back only from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That radiant smile-he believed it should be his alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s expression darkened, his gaze toward Ivan sharpening like a blade.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In his heart, Verena belonged to him, and no one else. Yet Ivan&#39;s presence had torn that fragile illusion apart,feeding his possessiveness and his envy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding his teeth, Simon fought the urge to seize her away then and there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew the moment was wrong. He could not let Verena glimpse the madness burning in him. Still, a silent vow seared his thoughts-lvan would pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena playfully pushed Ivan&#39;s hand off her shoulder. He feigned a pitiful look, but out of the corner of his eye caught a flicker on Simon&#39;s face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan hesitated. The look was gone in an instant, yet he was certain he hadn&#39;t imagined it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After their playful exchange,Verena straightened, composed again. &#34;Alright. I have things to do. I&#39;ll be off now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>00</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded to Simon in parting and turned to leave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena walked away, Simon departed in theopposite direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two parted paths, while Ivan remained where he was, his gaze tracking Simon&#39;s retreating figure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was something strangely familiar about him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan lowered his head, brows furrowed, searching his memory, but nothing surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain he had never met Simon before. And yet, that,feeling of familiarity lingered, stubborn as a shadow.</p>
