                <p>Verena leaned in, her elbows settling on the desk as she laced her fingers together. Her steady gaze radiated a sense of unwavering professionalism.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I want to really get a feel for how things are running across the company,&#34; said Verena. &#34;Let&#39;s start with each department. Fill me in on what everyone&#39;s responsible for and how the teams are structured.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced at Molly and continued, &#34;I&#39;m also curious about how everyone&#39;s doing at work, not just the day -to-day, but the atmosphere too. Teamwork and morale matter a lot for our growth.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes sharpened as she added, &#34;I&#39;d like a breakdown of where most of our customers are coming from-both the industries and the regions.That&#39;s going to be key for planning out our next moves in the market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned back, her tone becoming gentler.&#34;I know that&#39;s a lot to cover, so there&#39;s no rush to give me everything now. Just take your time and put together a thorough report. When it&#39;s ready, send it over so I can review all the details carefully.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly managed a polite smile and answered in a low  voice, &#34;Understood.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena spun her pen between her fingers, her gaze thoughtful. &#34;One more thing-what are the top projects we&#39;re working on right now? How are they progressing? Have we run into any big problems lately?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly hesitated at first, but honesty won out as she replied, &#34;Because of the spike in flu cases this season,we&#39;ve created a new treatment. It&#39;s almost ready for release-just a few last steps before it hits the shelves.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena offered a quiet nod. &#34;The flu making the rounds this year isn&#39;t like the old ones. People are dealing with more than just coughs and fevers-muscle aches have become a real problem. This new formula should help with that specifically.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her head, her eyes focused. &#34;So, what do the latest clinical trials show? Does the new medication actually relieve these symptoms? Have we encountered any setbacks or complications in development?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Distracted thoughts flickered across Molly&#39;s face, but when she looked up and met Verena&#39;s eyes, she forced herself to stay focused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She gave a nod before saying,&#34;The early results from the clinical trials turned out better than expected. The data strongly support the drug&#39;s safety and how well it  works. Production is already lined up, and both the packaging and marketing efforts are moving along without a hitch. As soon as we get through the last stage of approval, we&#39;ll be ready to roll it out into the market.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, sneaking a look at Verena, who seemned deep in thought, her brow slightly creased in concentration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of doubt crossed her mind, but Molly quickly composed herself. &#34;You can count on this. The whole team has poured their energy into bringing this medication to life. From the earliest stages of research right through to clinical testing, we&#39;ve given every detail our full attention. I promise, there won&#39;t be any mistakes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena regarded her in silence for a heartbeat, and then allowed a gentle smile to form. &#34;Thank you, Miss Kirk. I see how hard everyone&#39;s been working. I trust your judgment, and I&#39;m excited to see the launch go smoothly. That&#39;s all for now. Please continue with your day.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Molly as she got up, maintaining a steady, confident smile. &#34;You have my word. I&#39;ll be on top of everything, every step of the way.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, she slipped out of the office. When the door clicked shut, the smile faded from Verena&#39;s face,replaced by a thoughtful stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned back, letting the leather chair turn toward the sprawling cityscape outside the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Towering buildings lined the busy streets, cars moving in endless streams far below.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint frown touched her brow as she drifted deep into her own thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her background in medicine, Verena understood just how many hurdles stood between a promising compound and a finished product. Every new drug traveled a difficult path-from experiments in the lab,through rounds of testing on patients, all the way to the daunting stage of market approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no illusion that any of this would be easy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Earlier, Verena had fired off three sharp questions, one after the other. Molly&#39;s answers to the first two were sharp and on point, each word careful and deliberate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when the conversation shifted to the setbacks and complications in development, Molly&#39;s response grew vague,her words skirting around the heart of the issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was Molly dismissing those challenges as trivial? Or was she keeping something out of sight,maybe even &#34;You got it, Mrs. Bennett,&#34; said Zeke, his tone crisp and steady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As evening painted the city in neon colors, Verena sat in the back of the car, her face set in deep concentration. The world outside the window was just a blur as her thoughts spun.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A moment later, Zeke&#39;s figure appeared on the sidewalk. He rapped his knuckles softly against the glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jolted from her reverie, Verena lowered the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, Zeke passed her a slim folder.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena accepted the file, her eyes scanning the street for signs of prying eyes before she spoke quietly.&#34;Was anyone watching?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If word got out and the drug team had anything to hide, they would waste no time erasing the evidence.Chasing answers would become a nightmare.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeke reassured her, saying, &#34;No need to worry,Mrs.Bennett. I picked it up when the place was empty.Nobody saw a thing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeke didn&#39;t take the situation lightly. He knew exactly  how fragile Verena&#39;s standing in the company had become,and that awareness made him tread carefully with every step he took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a quiet nod and said, &#34;I appreciate what you&#39;ve done, Zeke.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the car drifted through the city,streaks of neon spilled over Verena, painting her features in shifting colors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She flipped open the folder and pulled out a small,sealed bag-inside, the new pills sat untouched and gleaming.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting the bag down, she turned to the stack of documents, leafing through page after page while the faint sound of paper echoed inside the car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With every new line she read, her brow furrowed a little more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first glance, the drug&#39;s formula looked by-the-book, yet something about the ingredient ratios struck her as odd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just reading through the report wasn&#39;t enough to put her suspicions to rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena exhaled quietly, placing the papers aside as her eyes drifted to the unopened packet. Clearly, she would have to dig much deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Sampson Villa,lights glowed brightly into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Luis away handling business, Verena lingered after dinner, sharing quiet conversation with her parents in the living room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she slipped back into her room, the clock was already creeping toward ten.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steam still clung to her skin after a quick shower, and she toweled her hair dry before settling at her desk.The sealed bag lay waiting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She poured one pill into her palm, rolling it between her fingers, curiosity sharpening her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Raising it to her nose, she drew in a faint whiff of medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She snapped the pill in half-an even,crisp break that left a fine powder clinging to her fingertips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning the pieces over in her hand, she examined the shade, the consistency, and the grain of the crushed medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A frown began to form, her confusion clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For all the fuss over this new formula, it felt oddly  familiar. Everything about it, down to the scent and texture, reminded her of nothing more than ordinary cold medicine.</p>
