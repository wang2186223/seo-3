                <p>Not once in the past would Kaia have even considered offering Verena an apology just because Alec asked her to.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Times had changed, though; now she would have gone to Verena on her own, with or without her father&#39;s request.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relying on Alec for support, Kaia rose to her feet, wiped away her tears, and managed a shaky nod. &#34;Dad, I know how much damage l&#39;ve done. The guilt is all mine. Whether Verena forgives me or not, I&#39;ll go to her and apologize from the heart. I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A new maturity caught Alec&#39;s eye as he studied Kaia-her time away had changed her, and relief flooded him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hand landed gently on her shoulder. &#34;You shouldn&#39;t be standing out here. Go on in and change. Luka will be home soon, and we&#39;ll finally share a meal as a family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the house, Kaia climbed the stairs to change. Luka&#39;s arrival in the living room happened just as she came back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The school event had just ended for Luka when a call from Kylee let him know Kaia had come home, so he&#39;d rushed out, grabbed a taxi, and hurried back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pure happiness lit up his face when he spotted his sister. &#34;You&#39;re home, Kaia! I&#39;ve missed you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick hug passed between them. Luka pulled back, frowning in confusion. &#34;Kaia, I tried calling your friends, but nobody had any idea where you were. What happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hesitation crept in before Kaia answered, repeating the same story she had told their parents earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka listened, concern written across his face, while Laura&#39;s eyes glistened with fresh tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up on the heaviness in the room, Alec lowered his newspaper and tried to bring comfort. &#34;What matters is that Kaia&#39;s safe. Let&#39;s have dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Later, Kaia retreated to her bedroom for a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she was alone, she retrieved her hidden phone and typed out a quick message to Katelyn.&#34;Everything went as planned. I&#39;ll talk to Verena tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s reply arrived almost instantly. &#34;Nice job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A smile played on Kaia&#39;s lips at the praise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following day, while Verena was in the middle of her workout in the home gym, Rhonda came by to let her know that Kaia had come to visit her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena arched her brow in surprise. &#34;Kaia? I thought Luka mentioned she&#39;d gone missing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quick tap switched off the treadmill, and Verena accepted the towel Rhonda handed her, dabbing at the sweat on her neck.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instructions came without hesitation. &#34;Let her know l&#39;m occupied. She&#39;ll have to wait.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda offered a respectful nod and made her way out of the gym.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Downstairs, she approached Kaia, who lounged on the sofa. &#34;Mrs. Bennett is busy at the moment, Miss Willis. She&#39;ll see you shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Waiting didn&#39;t rattle Kaia in the least; she had expected to be put off. Instead, she smiled with easy politeness. &#34;That&#39;s perfectly fine. I&#39;ll just wait here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Eventually, Verena wrapped up her workout, enjoyed a long, unhurried shower, and at last strolled into the living room, arms folded, voice breezy. &#34;Hope you weren&#39;t too bored waiting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena drew near, Kaia bounced up and slipped her arm through Verena&#39;s, her voice sugar-sweet and eyes bright. &#34;Come on, Verena, I&#39;m your little sister! Waiting for you is never a bother. Don&#39;t be so formal with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That syrupy tone made Verena inwardly cringe. She studied Kaia for a beat before quietly pulling away. &#34;Let&#39;s not drag this out. Why did you come?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia either didn&#39;t notice the chill or pretended not to. With a cheerful flourish, she started opening up the neatly stacked gift boxes on the table. &#34;Take a look at these, Verena. See anything you like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>First, she displayed a khaki coat, holding it up for inspection. &#34;I always see you in lighter colors. This one should suit you, don&#39;t you think?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching gears, she set down the coat and picked up a sleek black knit sweater. &#34;This would be perfect for spring-stylish and cozy. With your gorgeous features and that figure, you&#39;ll pull it off so elegantly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful energy lit up Kaia&#39;s face as she introduced each item, her smile the picture of innocent enthusiasm -a bubbly, girl-next-door vibe that would&#39;ve fooled almost anyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone unfamiliar with Kaia&#39;s true self might have believed the act.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hidden motives, Verena reminded herself, often wore the mask of kindness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Never for a second did she think Kaia had come just to deliver presents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone who knew the old Kaia would have expected a dramatic outburst by now after the long wait.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her act sweet and gentle felt completely out of character.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp,unimpressed glance from Verena cut through the air. &#34;Kaia, let&#39;s not pretend. I don&#39;t have time for your little charades. We&#39;re hardly close.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of hurt froze Kaia&#39;s smile before she forced a strained grin. &#34;You&#39;ve made it clear you don&#39;t like me,Verena, but I still need to say this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears threatened as she bit her lip, meeting Verena&#39;s gaze. &#34;I owe you an apology for everything. I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Mockery crept into Verena&#39;s voice, a soft chuckle escaping her. &#34;Did you really just apologize? You, of all people?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A small, nervous nod followed as Kaia twisted her hands together. &#34;I mean every word. I&#39;ve had time to think about all the ways I wronged you. We&#39;re sisters. Blood should matter most, but I kept hurting you. Sometimes I just want to slap myself for it...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With an indifferent shrug, Verena raised her eyebrows. &#34;Well, nothing&#39;s stopping you. If that&#39;s what you want,go ahead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion flickered across Kaia&#39;s face. &#34;What are you saying?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An almost teasing glint lit Verena&#39;s eyes. &#34;You said you want to slap yourself. So do it. I&#39;m not holding you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words cut deep, and Kaia&#39;s confidence wavered as Verena&#39;s gaze bored into her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how humble she tried to seem, Verena offered nothing but cold indifference-even now, after Kaia dragged herself here to apologize.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swallowing her pride felt unbearable, and if not for Evelyn&#39;s plan, she would have never tolerated such humiliation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beneath her calm, resentment simmered, but Kaia kept her composure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She understood she couldn&#39;t afford to disappoint Evelyn, especially when this was their one opportunity to bring Verena down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When it came to their bigger plar, letting go of her pride felt like a price she was willing to pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wiping away tears, Kaia managed a trembling nod. &#34;If that&#39;s what it takes for you to forgive me, Verena, I&#39;ll keep going until you believe me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharp slap echoed as she brought her hand down across her cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She didn&#39;t stop there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another resounding smack left her skin bright red, the sound harsh in the silent room, each blow sending new tears down her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No reaction came from Verena, who simply stood by, arms folded and gaze steady, refusing to give in to Kaia&#39;s display. Crying rarely moved Verena, especially not when she suspected the motives behind the person who tried to harm her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what Kaia&#39;s endgame was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Change didn&#39;t happen overnight, and Verena was far from convinced that Kaia&#39;s remorse was genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her time away-who had she spoken to, and what advice had she been given?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena never trusted the idea of chance.With Katelyn showing up to stir trouble and Kaia suddenly shifting her behavior, she was certain the timing wasn&#39;t accidental.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If the two of them were working together, Verena wanted to uncover exactly what they were plotting.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than sit back and wait for Kaia to make the first move, she chose to keep watch and see what kind of tricks Kaia might pull.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It also gave her a way to test if Kaia had truly matured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena said, &#34;That&#39;s enough. Stop right there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia froze at her words, her eyes darting toward Verena with unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave her a gentle smile. &#34;You&#39;re right. We&#39;re sistes, and family ties will always matter most. You&#39;ve apologized, and as your sister, I&#39;d be wrong not to forgive you.&#34;</p>
