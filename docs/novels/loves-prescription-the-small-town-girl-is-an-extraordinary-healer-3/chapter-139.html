                <p>With Isaac slowly assuming control of Bennett Group, Danica discovered her days carried less strain and far more ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On a rare quiet morning, she lounged on the sofa, absentmindedly playing with the cat as the television flickered in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A servantstepped forward and announced, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, Miss Fuller has arrived to see you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Danica blinked in mild surprise. &#34;Katelyn? She&#39;s really here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The servant nodded. &#34;Yes, ma&#39;am. Her car is waiting out front.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s hand froze mid-stroke, and a faint crease appeared between her brows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The purpose was easy enough to guess-Katelyn had already made it plain she wished to take charge of Isaac&#39;streatment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica hadn&#39;t dismissed the offer; she&#39;d told Isaac about it the same day, only for him to refuse outright with unshakable certainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To her surprise, days passed and yet Katelyn still pressed on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman&#39;s persistence was nothing short of stubborn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessness settled over her, for it was clear Isaac had no desire whatsoever to let Katelyn take control of his care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, the long-standing bond between the Fullers and Bennetts meant she had no choice but to receive Katelyn politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Letting out a quiet sigh, Danica switched off the television, passed the cat into the servant&#39;s arms, and said,&#34;Take it back to the cat house, and then show Miss Fuller inside.&#34; Cradling the cat carefully, the servant bowed. &#34;Yes, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once the cat was taken care of, the servant stepped outside to welcome Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the car, Katelyn noticed the servant drawing near. She removed her sunglasses, and then shifted toward Wendell.&#34;Professor Branson, you&#39;re clever. Keep your grandson in mind, and I trust I don&#39;t have to spell out what you should or shouldn&#39;t say in there, do l?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ride over had left Wendell restless. Never before had he been asked to lie to a patient&#39;s family, and the weight on his conscience was crushing. He clung to the hope that Katelyn truly meant to heal rather than harm,because if not, the guilt would break him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her reminder, Wendell&#39;s fists tightened on his knees, his voice cutting sharp. &#34;I&#39;ve heard you already.Don&#39;t repeat yourself. And you-remember that your aim is to save lives, not destroy them. Because if you stray from that, Miss Fuller, I&#39;ll stop you, even if it costs me everything.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Focused solely on her objective, Katelyn brushed aside Wendell&#39;s display of principle as though it were meaningless noise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping closer to the car, the servant bowed politely. &#34;Miss Fuller, you may come inside now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the driver swung the rear door open, Katelyn emerged gracefully, with Wendell trailing behind her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of the elderly man beside her, the servant hesitated briefly in confusion but kept silent,guiding them toward the gate.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once inside the living room, Katelyn spotted Danica and hurried forward, taking her hand warmly. &#34;Mrs.Bennett, it&#39;s so good to see you. I&#39;ve missed you and couldn&#39;t resist coming by again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hiding the resignation that tugged at her, Danica returned the smile. &#34;How did you know l&#39;d be home today,Katelyn? What if you came and I wasn&#39;t here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a cheerful lift of her lips, Katelyn answered, &#34;I didn&#39;t know at all-I simply took a chance. Luckily, you were here, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sweetness in her voice carried so naturally that Danica felt her mood lift in spite of herself. Curious, Danica asked, &#34;And how have your parents been these days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looping her arm through Danica&#39;s as they sat on the sofa, Katelyn said, &#34;They&#39;re both doing well.Just the other day, my mom mentioned she wanted to see you again-it&#39;s been too long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft chuckle, Danica remarked, &#34;You&#39;ve had such a sharp tongue and quick wit since you were little.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they chatted, Danica&#39;s eyes drifted past Katelyn and landed on the older man standing quietly in the background.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica studied his features carefully, a spark of recognition tugging at her memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Narrowing her eyes, she searched her mind, trying to place where she had seen him before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching Danica&#39;s attention on Wendell, Katelyn allowed a faint, knowing smile to touch her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since it was clear Danica already recognized Wendell, Katelyn chose not to offer an introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rising slowly to her feet, Danica spoke with a touch of hesitation. &#34;Am I right in thinking... you are Professor Wendell Branson?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joining in the moment, Katelyn smiled. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, your memory is sharp as ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprised to hear his name spoken, Wendell frowned slightly. &#34;You know me, Mrs. Bennett?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing his identity confirmed, Danica&#39;s face brightened. &#34;I often keep up with medical news, Professor Branson. You&#39;ve spent your life in service to medicine,teaching at Acorith College of Medicine-Shoildon&#39;s finest-and you&#39;ve earned a reputation as a truly esteemed educator. You&#39;re the kind of scholar anyone would admire.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As her praise flowed, shame pressed heavily on Wendell. The phrase &#34;anyone would admire&#34; struck him as painfully ironic, for he felt unfit for her respect while he prepared to deceive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wendell&#39;s fists clenched, and for a fleeting moment he nearly blurted out that Katelyn could not be trusted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reason soon stifled the impulse, and recalling Katelyn&#39;s cold warning,he swallowed his guilt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing a polite smile, Wendell answered, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I appreciate your kind words, but truly,I&#39;ve only done what any doctor should. Nothing so grand.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking his words for modesty, Danica replied with warmth, &#34;Professor Branson, do sit down.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Obediently, Wendell crossed the room and lowered himself onto the sofa across from Katelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gesturing toward a servant, Danica instructed, &#34;Dorcie, bring us some coffee.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her request was made, she turned back to Wendell with a pleasant smile. &#34;Professor Branson, did you have something particular you wanted to discuss with me today?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Actually, I-&#34; Wendell blurted out, but Katelyn cut across him. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to say.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Danica shifted her gaze toward Katelyn. Though she had an inkling of what was coming, she still asked, &#34;And what would that be?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn answered smoothly, &#34;It concerns our last conversation-about Isaac&#39;s treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once again, the subject circled back to the same issue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a resigned look, Danica exhaled softly. &#34;Katelyn, the last time you spoke to me, I went straight to Isaac and told him. He was firm-he doesn&#39;t want you treating him. Talking to me won&#39;t change anything.If you truly want this, you&#39;ll need to convince Isaac himself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Expecting that answer,Katelyn nodded and said, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, l&#39;ve already spoken directly to lsaac.He refused me too. After that, I went to his wife. We sat down and went over Isaac&#39;s condition in detail, talking about which treatment might serve him best.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone dimmed as disappointment colored her words. &#34;Buut the entire time, she seemed fixated on the fact that Isaac and I were childhood friends. She cared more about my history with Isaac than about his health. In the end, she rejected my plan to treat him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Katelyn clasped Danica&#39;s hand firmly. &#34;But you&#39;re not like her, Mrs. Bennett. You&#39;re his mother -you care most about his well-being. Couldn&#39;t you find a way to persuade Isaac, even compel him, to let me treat him?&#34; When her plea was finished, Katelyn fell silent, waiting patiently for Danica&#39;s answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding perfectly what Katelyn was pushing toward, Danica sat in silence for a moment before breathing out a faint sigh.</p>
