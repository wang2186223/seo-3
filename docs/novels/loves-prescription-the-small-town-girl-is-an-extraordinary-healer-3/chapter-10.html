                <p>Bobby had no patience for people who hid behind self-righteousness to mask their manipulation. If Isaac&#39;s future happiness hadn&#39;t been on the line, he wouldn&#39;t have wasted a breath on someone as foolish as Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the sake of his goal, he swallowed his distaste and didn&#39;t call her out. Instead, he played along and tried to convince her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He typed out a long message. &#34;Do you really think marrying lsaac is the best thing that could happen to your sister? She grew up far from the city&#39;s pace, never went to college, never stepped into elite circles. In a family like mine, she&#39;d be out of her depth before the first dinner party. When the conversation turns to business or high society, she&#39;ll have nothing to say. And don&#39;t forget-Isaac may be in a wheelchair,but his mind is as sharp as ever. He&#39;s still the same strategist who dominated the business world. They&#39;re not equals, and being with him won&#39;t give Verena a shred of happiness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia didn&#39;t give a thought to Verena&#39;s well-being. Her only objective was to break the engagement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wished she could meet Bobby now and discuss the plans to stop this marriage. Still, she knew she had to mask her eagerness, play the part of the reluctant participant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his message went unanswered, Bobby recognized the ploy instantly. Kaia was dangling hesitation to draw him in. He pressed anyway, guiding her toward joining forces. &#34;She claims a degree from a prestigious university, but it&#39;s a lie. People will talk. And if word gets around that the Willis family stooped to disgraceful tricks just to push her into the Bennett family, you won&#39;t just damage her reputation-you&#39;ll drag your whole family&#39;s name through the mud in Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The barb landed exactly where Bobby intended. He&#39;d offered Kaia a neat escape from her fake benevolence, and, just as he expected, her reply came back almost instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s true. Verena&#39;s far too timid-marrying into the Bennett family would only see her pushed around.And because of her bold lies, the Willis name would be tied to rumors of using shady tactics. Worse still,your Bennett family would end up being the laughingstock.&#34; Bobby scanned her message, his lips curling in silent disdain. Fool. Who in their right mind would dare mock the Bennett family? Only moments ago she&#39;d been insisting Verena would be lucky to marry into their ranks,and now she was parroting his words without hesitation. Her sudden agreement told him everything-Kaia was willing to join forces with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another message came through before he could finish the thought. &#34;Although I know this isn&#39;t right,for Verena&#39;s sake and for the Willis family&#39;s dignity, I&#39;ll work with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A humorless chuckle escaped Bobby. Kaia had a knack for wrapping her schemes in silk, making herself look noble while pretending her hands were clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If it weren&#39;t for his determination to keep Verena away from Isaac, he wouldn&#39;t waste a single word on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are kind-hearted to a fault,&#34; Bobby replied, the sarcasm tucked neatly behind a smooth tone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s cheeks warmed when she read it. Was that a compliment? Many had praised her before, but never someone of Bobby&#39;s rank. She&#39;d heard he was proud, even dismissive, and rarely spoke well of anyone.Could he actually be interested in her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia lingered over the message, her thoughts tumbling ahead of her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Isaac confined to a wheelchair, Bobby stood as the Bennett family&#39;s brightest heir. His tone almost hinted at interest-didn&#39;t it? If Isaac couldn&#39;t be won, then Bobby would make an excellent prize instead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling a rush of satisfaction, she responded wit a feigned modesty, &#34;I&#39;m honored you&#39;d say that. My concern is only for Verena-it&#39;s not about being kind. She&#39;s my sister, after all. If I won&#39;t think for her, who will?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby didn&#39;t even bother responding. What a ridiculous woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Switching back to business, Kaia asked, &#34;So, where and when should we meet?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still undecided, Bobby sent a short reply, saying, &#34;I&#39;ll let you know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Kaia answered, punctuating it with a cutesy emoji.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a glance at it, Bobby tossed the phone onto the table and headed straight for lsaac&#39;s study. A firm rap of his knuckles sounded against the heavy door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac sat behind his desk, eyes scanning a stack of documents. At the knock, he didn&#39;t even glance up.&#34;Come in,&#34; he said, his tone flat and detached.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The latch clicked, and the door swung open almost immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby strode in without hesitation, his voice brimming with urgency. &#34;Isaac, did Verena tell you she graduated from Pine Hill University? Don&#39;t buy it-she&#39;s justa-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get out,&#34; Isaac interjected, his voice like ice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He knew exactly where Bobby was going with this and had no interest in hearing the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sharp dismissal threw Bobby off balance, but he tried to push through. &#34;Isaac-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One glance from Isaac stopped him cold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The slight furrow of Isaac&#39;s brows and the glint in his eyes carried a silent, unmistakable warning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby had feared that look since they were kids. When Isaac got serious, backing down wasn&#39;t just smart-it was instinct.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby swallowed his frustration and walked out without another word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered on the door long after it shut, his expression unreadable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out in the hallway, Bobby replayed the exchange in his mind-lsaac&#39;s cold indifference, Kaia&#39;s manipulations. If Kaia could be that rotten and she was Verena&#39;s sister, then Verena couldn&#39;t be much better.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A low, derisive laugh slipped from Bobby&#39;s lips. The Willis sisters-one a hypocrite, the other a fraud.Disabled or not, Isaac deserved better than either of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby was determined to stop this marriage from happening. Resolved, he chose a meeting spot, set the time, and sent Kaia a short message telling her to meet him tomorrow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Morning came, and a gleaming red sports car rolled smoothly along the main road, its driver locked on the traffic ahead.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Halfway through a turn, a muffled ringtone buzzed from the inside pocket of his jacket.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby took out his phone, checked the screen, and pressed it to his ear. &#34;Mom, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t &#39;what&#39;s going on&#39; me,&#34; Danica retorted immediately. &#34;Why aren&#39;t you at the office?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way Bobby was going to explain where he was really headed, so he kept his tone light.&#34;Taking a day off.Got something important to handle.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Important?&#34; she scoffed. &#34;The only &#39;important&#39; things you do are eat, drink, and waste time. Get yourself back to work.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby&#39;s lips twisted in a dry smile. Same old script. In her eyes, he&#39;d never been anything more than an idle boy who knew nothing but how to enjoy himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Telling Danica he was out digging for ways to sabotage the marriage alliance wasn&#39;t part of Bobby&#39;s plan,but the constant nagging scraped against his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His patience snapped. &#34;I&#39;m doing this for lsaac&#39;s future, whether you see it or not. Maybe you don&#39;t care,but I do. Verena isn&#39;t beautiful, she isn&#39;t properly educated, and she&#39;s completely unfit to be by his side.I don&#39;t know what scheme you&#39;ve got in motion, but disabled or not, Isaac is still the Bennett family&#39;s eldest son. He deserves a wife who matches him in every way, not someone far beneath him. How can you ignore what he wants-or what&#39;s best for his life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The heat in Bobby&#39;s words was met with nothing but silence on the other end.</p>
