                <p>Tobin showed up with remarkable composure, as though he&#39;d been out for a relaxing stroll instead of facing a life-or-death situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everything that had just unfolded struck Erick like a slap in the face. Only now did he grasp how thoroughly he&#39;d been duped. Tobin&#39;s earlier surrender was an act, and the story about Verena being his girlfriend was nothing but a clever ruse. Every detail had been designed to lead him astray.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mix of anger and anxiety gripped Erick. The thought of Maxton waking up and discovering his betrayal sent a wave of fear through him. If that happened,he wouldn&#39;t just lose everything; the consequences would be far worse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With this thought, his blood ran cold, and his jaw clenched tight. There was no way he could let things end like this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation crawled up Erick&#39;s spine as he racked his brain for any way to salvage the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right then, an idea suddenly sparked, and a cocky smirk curled at his lips. Lifting his gaze, he taunted, &#34;Impressive, Tobin. You even roped Evelyn into your performance. I&#39;ll admit defeat this time, but don&#39;t think you can keep me down with just this little trick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin replied, his tone sharp as a knife, &#34;You&#39;re right,I can&#39;t bring you down so easily. But you aimed for more than just me today. You went after our father,too. When he wakes up and learns what you&#39;ve done,do you honestly believe he&#39;ll let it slide?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze fixed on Erick, Tobin continued, &#34;I won&#39;t have to lift a finger. Our father will be the one to deal with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though Tobin made the consequences crystal clear, Erick showed not a hint of fear. A cool grin spread across his face as he nodded. &#34;You&#39;re absolutely right. Dad&#39;s reputation for being ruthless in business is legendary. If he ever discovers my part in this, I&#39;ll be finished.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow crossed Erick&#39;s face, and his voice took on a dangerous edge. &#34;But let me ask you, Tobin,are you really prepared for Dad to hear the truth? Remember,your youngest daughter goes to a school that answers to me, staffed with people loyal to me alone. One call from me, and she could vanish without a trace.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the surface, Tobin&#39;s expression barely shifted,but inside, he felt nothing but cold,bitter disappointment.A weary sigh escaped him. &#34;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d throw  away your own family just for the sake of power and money.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick responded with a dismissive laugh, &#34;Family means nothing compared to wealth and power! As long as I&#39;mn not the one pulling the strings, I&#39;ll always be trapped by someone else. I&#39;d much rather be the one in charge than spend my life being ordered around.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick&#39;s relentless attitude made further conversation pointless in Tobin&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you really believe I&#39;d lay a trap without having a backup plan?&#34; Tobin shook his head, a wry smile tugging at his mouth. &#34;Everything was already in place before Evelyn got here, and I was just waiting for you to take the bait. If you want to threaten me with my daughter, by all means, try it. Let&#39;s see if a single phone call is enough to make her disappear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Erick couldn&#39;t wrap his head around how Tobin had managed to act so fast. With his desperation mounting,he fumbled for his phone and tried to make a call,clinging to his last shred of hope. The call never went through; the line stayed busy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frustration built with each failed attempt. Erick dialed again, refusing to accept defeat, only to be met with the same unbroken silence. His face hardened in an instant. Jaw clenched, he snapped, &#34;I won&#39;t let you win. This isn&#39;t over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin&#39;s gaze was cold as he watched Erick unravel.Turning to his men, he spoke in a flat, commanding tone. &#34;Erick&#39;s lost his mind. Take him away and keep him under strict watch. Make sure he stays put until my father wakes up. We can&#39;t risk him doing anything reckless.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His orders were met with a chorus of obedient voices.&#34;Understood,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation,several burly bodyguards closed in and led Erick out of the hospital.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rest of Erick&#39;s followers were swiftly dealt with,restoring order to the hospital in a matter of moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once calm returned, Tobin glanced over at Verena,letting out a weary sigh. &#34;I&#39;m sorry you had to see all of that, Evelyn.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Offering a gentle, understanding smile, Verena replied,&#34;No family is perfect. Everyone faces their own battles.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reassurance struck Tobin as oddly comforting. In his mind, someone as capable as Evelyn must have come from a stable, supportive family, far removed from this kind of chaos. What he didn&#39;t realize was  that Verena had already weathered similar storms with Alec&#39;s family, and scenes like this barely fazed her anymore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After exchanging a few more words, Tobin&#39;s anxiety resurfaced. &#34;Evelyn, how is my father now? When do you think he&#39;ll wake up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena explained, &#34;The operation just ended, and your father&#39;s still under anesthesia. It&#39;s hard to say exactly when he&#39;ll become conscious, but I&#39;m confident he&#39;ll be awake by tonight.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Tobin, the tension melting from his shoulders as he sighed. &#34;That&#39;s a huge relief.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena laid out the recovery plan for Tobin. She explained, &#34;When your father wakes up, he&#39;ll have to remain on strict bed rest for no less than two months.It&#39;s important that he stays calm and avoids any unnecessary stress or activity during his recovery. I&#39;ve already briefed the nurses who helped during the surgery. They know exactly how to care for him,so you can put your mind at ease.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For half a year, Tobin had knocked on the doors of every prominent doctor he could find, each one telling him there was no hope for his father.Hearing Evelyn say that recovery was possible nearly brought him to tears. Standing tall, Tobin offered Verena a deep bow before speaking. &#34;Evelyn, I can never repay what you&#39;ve done for my father. If you hadn&#39;t come along,I&#39;d still be desperately searching for answers. If there&#39;s anything you want, say the word. As long as it&#39;s within my reach, I&#39;ll make it happen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena could sense the genuine gratitude behind Tobin&#39;s words, so different from Erick&#39;s cold ambition.Maybe it was his status as the favored oldest son, or maybe he truly cared about his father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft smile, Verena responded, &#34;Actually, there is one thing I&#39;d like you to help me with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tobin didn&#39;t hesitate for a second. &#34;Just tell me what you need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena responded calmly, &#34;What I&#39;d like is for you to put an end to those entertainment news articles linking us together.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What?&#34; That answer took Tobin by surprise. He stared at her, realizing she was completely serious.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He blinked, genuinely puzzled. &#34;That&#39;s all you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With someone in his position, removing a news story was as easy as making it appear in the first place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful glint flashed in Verena&#39;s eyes as she added,  half-teasing, &#34;Naturally, that&#39;s not the only thing I&#39;ll ever ask for. Favors like these aren&#39;t paid off so easily.But since you&#39;re determined to repay me, Mr.Fairclough, I won&#39;t hesitate to reach out if anything else comes up. For now, though, that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Katelyn&#39;s friend stumbled across the headlines before they were wiped from the web and immediately sent them her way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I don&#39;t usually keep up with news, but this was everywhere.&#34; The friend messaged. &#34;Isn&#39;t this woman the wife of the guy you&#39;re interested in? How did she get caught up with Tobin Fairclough?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was no secret among Katelyn&#39;s friends that she liked Isaac. After clashing with Verena and coming out defeated, Katelyn couldn&#39;t help but vent her frustration to her friends. She had sent them pictures of Verena and ranted about how much better she was.That was why, when her friend saw the photo in the news,she recognized Verena right away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After reading the message, Katelyn shot up in bed, a jolt of disbelief running through her.</p>
