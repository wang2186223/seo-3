                <p>Once the plan wrapped up, Katelyn led Kaia to the car and leaned close. &#34;I want you to avoid any unnecessary trouble. The driver will drop you off inthe city center. He&#39;ll hand you the cash there, and you can catch a cab the rest of the way home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without a word, the driver swept open the rear door. Kaia slid inside and offered a nod. &#34;Understood. That makes sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as the car was about to pull away,Katelyn stepped up to the open window, concern etched on her face.&#34;Kaia, don&#39;t rush into anything. I need you to be careful and think every decision through.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s lips curled into a faint smile as she met Katelyn&#39;s eyes. &#34;You can trust me. I know exactly what&#39;s at stake. I&#39;m not the same person I was before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With their exchange finished, Kaia pressed the button to close the window. The vehicle eased away from the curb, soon vanishing down the avenue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching the city&#39;s heart, the driver eased the car to a stop by the roadside. He passed the envelope of bills to Kaia, who stepped out, and then made her way across the street, flagging down a waiting taxi.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her journey ended at Willis Villa. Before she got out, Kaia paused for a moment to gather herself. She paid the driver, and then stepped into the sunlight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Out front, the maid, Kylee Cooper, stood snipping branches, but the sight of Kaia stepping from the cab stopped her cold. After a stunned heartbeat, Kylee rushed over, tears bright in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Miss Willis, you&#39;ve finally come home!&#34; Kylee&#39;s voice trembled. &#34;Since you vanished, everyone&#39;s been searching for you. Mrs. Willis hasn&#39;t slept a full night since. We&#39;ve all been so worried.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having watched Kaia grow from childhood, Kylee had carried her absence like a wound. Now relief and heartbreak mingled as she welcomed Kaia back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emotions swelled inside Kaia, and her voice caught. &#34;I missed all of you, Kylee.I really did.&#34; With trembling hands, Kylee dabbed at her tears, nodding over and over. &#34;I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am to see you safe. It&#39;s good to have you home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia cast a look toward the silent living room before lowering her voice. &#34;Kylee, where are my parents? And Luka?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;They&#39;re not home at the moment,&#34; said Kylee softly. &#34;Your parents had to go to the company, and Luka has something at school. Why don&#39;t you come in and rest while you wait for them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kylee reached out, intending to usher her inside. To her surprise, Kaia hesitated and pulled her hand free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of concern passed over Kylee&#39;s face. &#34;Is somethingthe matter, Miss Willis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s gaze dropped as she recalled Katelyn&#39;s words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A single goal carried her home. She needed Alec and Laura to forgive her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If she made it through the door like nothing happened, Laura would show her some compassion, but Alec&#39;s quick temper would almost certainly mean she&#39;d face his anger and a long lecture about her foolishness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking back on Katelyn&#39;s advice, Kaia realized she needed to look as helpless as possible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So, she stepped back, refusing to meet Kylee&#39;s eyes, and shook her head. &#34;Kylee, I don&#39;t deserve to walk inside. I messed up. I&#39;ll wait righthere uuntil my parents come home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A worried frown creased Kylee&#39;s brow as she reached for Kaia&#39;s arm. &#34;You can&#39;t stay out here, not with night coming on. You&#39;ll get sick.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, Kaia slipped from Kylee&#39;s grasp and dropped to her knees on the walkway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Kylee blurted out, &#34;Miss Willis, why are you kneeling?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears spilled over Kaia&#39;s cheeks as she begged, &#34;I won&#39;t move until my parents come back and forgive me. Please, Kylee, just let me stay here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To anyone watching, Kaia looked every bit the picture of a remorseful daughter. Her fists, hidden at her sides,were balled up tight. From the time she was little, Kaia had never known real discipline. She was always sheltered and never had to humble herself in front of the staff.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s arrival had changed everything. If she hadn&#39;t shown up, Kaia would still be living like a little princess, never needing to bow her head.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kylee&#39;s anxiety shot through the roof at the sight. &#34;Oh dear...What do I do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An idea struck her, and she quickly fished out her phone, stepping away as she dialed Alec&#39;s assistant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Wallace? It&#39;s Kylee from the villa. Kaia is here...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she heard the call, Kaia dipped her head, and a faint, almost hidden smile touched her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long after the call ended, Alec&#39;s car rolled into the driveway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the car stopped, Kylee rushed over to greet the couple. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Willis, thank goodness you&#39;re finally home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura barely waited for the car to stop before she rushed out. Spotting Kaia kneeling near the entryway,worry and frustration flashed across her face as she hurried over. She grabbed Kaia&#39;s shoulders, her voice trembling. &#34;Where have you been all this time? Do you have any idea how much we searched for you? Not a single day went by when we weren&#39;t frantic.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the words left Laura&#39;s lips than Alec&#39;s voice cut through the air from behind. &#34;So, you actually showed your face here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sharp look in Kaia&#39;s direction, Alec strode past without slowing, heading straight for the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His tone was as cold as a winter gust, and every word stung as it hung between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing he was about to disappear inside, Kaia scrambled to stand. &#34;Dad, wait, please-ouch!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her knees buckled, sending her straight back to the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The noise caught Alec&#39;s attention, and though he paused, his back remained turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glance at Kaia&#39;s bruised knees made Laura&#39;s heart clench. She called after him, her voice raw. &#34;Alec, can&#39;t you stop for one moment and listen to your daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for a reply, Laura knelt beside Kaia and slipped an arm under her shoulders. &#34;Come on, Kaia.You have to get up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Alec stood rigid, Kaia shook her head. &#34;I can&#39;t get up yet. I have to answer for what I&#39;ve done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence fell before Alec finally turned around, coming to stand before her, hands clasped behind his back. &#34;Alright. Go on. Let&#39;s hear what you have to say for yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Staying on her knees, Kaia bit her lower lip so hard her eyes shimmered with tears. Slowly, she lifted her gazeto meet theirs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled. &#34;Dad, Mom, I&#39;m truly sorry. I should never have done those things.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Kylee interjected, unable to stay quiet, &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Willis, Kaia has been out here this entire time, kneeling. No matter what I told her, she wouldn&#39;t get up. She kept saying she couldn&#39;t step inside until you both forgave her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A mother&#39;s instinct kicked in, and Laura&#39;s anger faded, replaced by a deep ache for her daughter.Seeing Kaia so broken, tears streaking down her cheeks, Laura gathered her up in a fierce embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She whispered, &#34;That&#39;s enough now. I&#39;m just glad you see your mistakes. Come, let&#39;s get you inside.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had Laura spoken than Alec cast his gaze down on Kaia,his voice laced with skepticism. &#34;Is that so? Suddenly you&#39;re ready to admit you were wrong? I figured you&#39;d been off somewhere, not giving us a single thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That biting edge in Alec&#39;s voice made it clear his anger had not faded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a gentle but determined motion, Kaia freed herself from Laura&#39;s hold and met her father&#39;s gaze. &#34;I know you&#39;re angry, Dad. Honestly, just being allowed back here is more than I hoped for. I kept thinking I&#39;d never have the chance to see you both again.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Frowning, Alec looked confused for a moment, Laura leaned forward and asked, &#34;Why did you think you wouldn&#39;t see us anymore?&#34; Taking a steadying breath, Kaia finally answered, &#34;A sudden storm came thenight I left, and I lost all sense of direction. After wandering around in circles, I finally collapsed by the roadside. My next memory was waking up in a cramped, unfamiliar space. Darkness and fear pressed in on me, and I truly believed that was it. Only when the person who took me left me unattended did I manage to slip out and escape.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carefully,Kaia watched both of her parents to see how they would react to her story.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes filled with tears, and Alec&#39;s face tightened with concern.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, her words had reached them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears began streaming down Kaia&#39;s face as she continued, &#34;I was completely lost, with nothing and no one to help me. My phone had disappeared, so I couldn&#39;t even try to reach you. I walked for hours, eating whatever scraps I could find, hoping I might stumble across something familiar. Eventually, I reached the city, but I had no money left. A girl I&#39;d never met took pity on me and gave me taxi fare so I could come home.Going through all of that made me see how foolish I&#39;d been. All my life,you protected me from any real hardship. Verena spent her childhood shouldering responsibility, taking care of Grandma out in the countryside.When Grandma died, Verena finally came here to live with us, but I was too jealous of your attention and let it make me act horribly toward her. Everything I did to her, I regret now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sobs wracked Kaia until she struggled to breathe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching Alec&#39;s trousers, she loøked up through her tears and pleaded, &#34;Dad, I swear I&#39;ll never hurt Verena again. Please, I want youto forgive me. I&#39;ll make it right, I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A downward glance from Alec showed a trace of inner conflict; his jaw tightened, yet the anger in his eyes faded, though he said nothing in return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Laura couldn&#39;t hold back her own tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To see her daughter suffer such hardship was a pain Laura had never imagined she would feel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura shoved Alec lightly and cried out through her tears, &#34;Alec, you claimed she was out there enjoying herself, yet you were the one who cut off every bit of her financial support. How could she possibly live that kind of life? Didn&#39;t you hear what happened? Kaia was kidnapped and barely made it back alive. She realizes her mistakes now; her knees are raw from kneeling, and you still refuse to forgive her? She&#39;s your own daughter by blood. Doesn&#39;t that mean anything to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavy silence hung in the air after Laura finished speaking, and Alec couldn&#39;t help but steal a glance at Kaia as her sobs echoed around them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart tightened; any father would feel moved seeing his own child so broken, especially when her remorse was so raw and honest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering himself beside her, Alec placed a firm hand on her shoulder and spoke quietly. &#34;If you truly want to make things right, you&#39;ll visit Verena tomorrow and apologize to her directly. That&#39;s the first step you need to take.&#34;</p>
