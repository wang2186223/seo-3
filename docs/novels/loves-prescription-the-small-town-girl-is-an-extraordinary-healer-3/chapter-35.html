                <p>Bobby leaned forward eagerly and blurted out, &#34;Isaac,I&#39;ve already added her on the chat app. Why don&#39;t you set up a time to meet her? I swear, with her skills, she could fix your legs for sure!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was too caught up in his own excitement to notice the faint crease forming on Isaac&#39;s brow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of Barrie&#39;s so-called recovery pulled a smirk from lsaac. Dozens of renowned doctors had failed, and yet this one was supposed to succeed?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up his book, Isaac flipped the page and said evenly, &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. I know my own condition better than anyone. No matter how capable she is, it makes no difference for me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While he spoke, an image of Verena surfaced in his thoughts.Why was it only her that stirred hope in him,only her he felt he could believe in?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a thin line before he added, &#34;I&#39;m already in treatment. You don&#39;t need to involve yourself in this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Up until now, Cayden had been the one overseeing  Isaac&#39;s treatment. So when Isaac mentioned being in treatment, Bobby immediately assumed Cayden was still handling it. He vaguely recalled Cayden once admitting that the surgery carried no more than a thirty percent chance of success.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It wasn&#39;t that Bobby distrusted Cayden&#39;s abilities, but faced with the promise of a doctor who appeared even more remarkable, his loyalties naturally shifted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After all, Dr. Willis had claimed she&#39;d successfully cured two patients with leg paralysis-and if that was true, then surely she was the better choice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing Isaac wasn&#39;t going to agree easily, Bobby decided to pour on the charm and persuasion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, I&#39;m asking you to believe me. This doctor isn&#39;t ordinary. Think back to Barrie&#39;s illness a few years ago -every specialist, here and overseas, refused to take the risk of that impossible heart transplant. But she did it,and she pulled it off flawlessly. Please, just meet her once. Maybe she really can change everything for you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac kept his eyes locked on the book,showing no sign of giving in, Bobby grew frantic and yelled,&#34;Don&#39;t you even want the chance to walk on your own again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For just a second Isaac&#39;s hand stilled on the page, but then he calmly turned it and kept reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching himself, Bobby slapped a hand over his mouth and murmured, &#34;I didn&#39;t mean it like that, Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to recover, he added, &#34;I only meant she&#39;s exceptional. If she could handle Barrie&#39;s case, she can handle yours too. Why not just give her a chance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had tolerated Bobby&#39;s endless peading,but the refusal to drop the subject left him weary,and a dull ache began to settle in his temples.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Isaac closed the book, fixed him with a cold,unblinking look, and said, &#34;Barrie&#39;s illness is different from mine, so don&#39;t compare them. Your praise for that doctor is just the view of an outsider, and it means nothing to me. I have no reason to meet her,and I won&#39;t be accepting her treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then his voice turned firm as he instructed, &#34;That&#39;s enough. It&#39;s late. Go back to your room.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby had clung to the hope that lsaac might finally say yes,but the blunt refusal knocked the wind out of him. A wave of sadness and frustration washed over him, because in his heart, everything he said had only been for lsaac&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby kept his frustration to himself. If Isaac didn&#39;t want him stepping in, then fine-he&#39;d stop wasting energy on someone who clearly didn&#39;t want the help. Let him pick whichever doctor he wanted, and if he had someone in mind to marry, then so be it. That was his business now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Resigned to it, Bobby sighed out a flat &#34;okay&#34; before dragging himself back to his room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the days that followed, Verena spent her time shuttling between the Lyons estate and the Willis Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, after two long weeks of treatment,Verena pulled out the final needle from Barrie&#39;s leg and smiled. &#34;Congratulations. From here on out, you won&#39;t need these sessions anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Barrie had a chance to respond, Slater&#39;s eyes lit up with joy. &#34;Are you serious, Dr. Willis? My grandpa truly doesn&#39;t need the treatment anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a confident nod, and Slater immediately bowed in gratitude. &#34;Thank you so much,Dr.Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She steadied him by the shoulders and smiled. &#34;His progress is thanks in part to the care you&#39;ve given him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Indeed.&#34; From the bed, Barrie clasped Slater&#39;s hand,his dim eyes filled with warmth. &#34;You&#39;ve grown thin looking after me like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Placing his firm hand over Barrie&#39;s frail one, Slater met his gaze with devotion. &#34;Grandpa, I don&#39;t feel tired at all. Nothing matters more than your health.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Verena watched the tender exchange between grandfather and grandson, her thoughts drifted to her own grandmother, Shawna. If only Shawna were still alive... Without her, Verena had no real family left in this world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tightness formed in her throat, but Verena forced the memory away with a steady blink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning back to Slater, she instructed, &#34;His condition is stable,but small problems remain that need medicine.I&#39;ll write down the prescriptions, and you can handle preparing them for him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater gave a firm nod. &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll take care of it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Devoted as ever, Slater personally took charge of preparing every dose of Barrie&#39;s medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena handed over the prescriptions and finished her instructions, she added warmly, &#34;That&#39;s everything for now. I won&#39;t be coming for the treatments anymore, but if your grandfather feels unwell, just call me. Unless something unusual keeps me away, I&#39;ll come without hesitation.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Overwhelmed with gratitude, Slater kept thanking her again and again for helping his grandfather recover. Once Verena departed, Slater carried the herbal medicine she prescribed into the kitchen and began preparing the brew himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the herbs simmered, Slater pulled out his phone and snapped a quick picture of the steaming pot</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinning with pride, he uploaded the photo with a caption:&#34;These remedies are working-Grandpa&#39;s legs are finally improving. Couldn&#39;t be happier!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Willis Villa, relaxing on the sofa, Kaia scrolled idly through her phone until Slater&#39;s update appeared, sending a rush of excitement through her.The herbs and supplements she had sent to the Lyons estate had actually taken effect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pride swelled in her chest, and a smile tugged at her lips. Even the remedies she had chosen so casually were helping Barrie heal-it almost felt like proof she had a natural talent for medicine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scrolling back to reread his post, Kaia&#39;s grin widened until she let out a laugh. Everyone knew how devoted Slater was to his grandfather, so if Barrie&#39;s recovery was tied to the herbs and supplements she gave, then surely Slater would start viewing her differently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the couch nearby, Laura shifted her gaze from the TV when she heard Kaia laughing and asked with curiosity, &#34;Kaia, what&#39;s on your phone that&#39;s got you so cheerful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her cheeks warm from excitement, Kaia eagerly passed the phone to her mother and said, &#34;Mom,you&#39;ve got to see what Slater posted.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Peering at the screen for a moment, Laura&#39;s eyes went wide in surprise. &#34;Goodness! Is that the same herbal medicine you sent over before?&#34;</p>
