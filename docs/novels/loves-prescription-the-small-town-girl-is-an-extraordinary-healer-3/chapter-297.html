                <p>When Verena lifted her gaze, she caught sight of Joseph standing a short distance away, his eyes red and swollen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips parted slightly as she whispered,almost like a prayer, &#34;Dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph froze, as if struck by lightning, before joy broke through his surprise. A rare light filled his eyes,leaving him flustered and at a loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But quickly, his face bloomed into a smile-half wonder,half delight-as he answered with eagerness,&#34;Yes,my dear.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing her father&#39;s tear-streaked eyes, Verena felt her heart twist painfully, and for a moment, tears threatened to rise again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was never one to wear her emotions openly for all to see.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her lips together, lowered her head, and gathered herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heartbeat later, she lifted her eyes once more,glancing at Luis before resting her gaze on Joseph. &#34;Dad, Luis... all these years, I&#39;ve made you live with worry and longing. From today onward, I will no longer be the cause of your sleepless nights.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph and Luis leaned forward to speak, but Verena continued firmly, &#34;I carefully studied Mom&#39;s condition in the ward just now. Judging from her symptoms, and with the medical knowledge l&#39;ve acquired, I may attempt a treatment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph stiffened at her words. Luis, quicker to recover,was the first to break the silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His face lit with astonishment and hope as he blurted out, &#34;Verena,do you mean you can treat Mom? Is that true?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved in a small, composed smile.Meeting their astonished gazes, she said calmly, &#34;Luis,I believe you&#39;ve looked into my background thoroughly.I cannot promise a miracle, but I hold at least fifty percent confidence.And now that I am here,the chance of healing her troubled spirit grows even stronger.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Joseph looked upon Verena with eyes full of recognition and pride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It seemed his daughter had grown into someone far greater than he had expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to restrain himself, Joseph&#39;s face softened into  a smile of deep satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wonderful! This is wonderful!&#34; His voice trembled with excitement he could not contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning sharply to Luis, he ordered, &#34;Luis, gather your mother&#39;s medical records from the past year and hand them over to Verena.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis gave a quick nod, already drawing out his phone as his fingers flew across the screen.&#34;Alright,I&#39;ll send them right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Since Verena stepped out of the ward, Isaac had remained at her side, quiet as a shadow.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he said nothing, Verena felt the silent shield of his presence. He was giving her the space to face her family,yet protecting her all the same.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth surged through her chest, and a tender smile tugged at her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She reached for his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Isaac turned to her, and then quickly clasped her hand tightly, his eyes softening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile deepened as she faced Joseph and spoke with steady resolve. &#34;Dad, allow me to introduce him.This is Isaac Bennett-my husband.&#34; The title struck Isaac like a sudden thunderclap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His heart skipped, and then pounded so wildly it was as though it echoed in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Almost instinctively, he straightened his posture, his gaze lowering briefly to his legs. For once, the calm and composed mask he usually wvore gave way to a rare trace of nervousness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could not help but wonder whether Verena&#39;s father might harbor prejudice against him, or question his strength and ability to stand by her side.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph, despite the years weighing on him, carried himself with elegance and grace. His eyes, though softened by age, were still sharp, expressive, and full of insight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In truth, he had already sensed the truth before Verena even mentioned Isaac. After all, when two souls are bound in love, their eyes betray the secret long before words do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s gaze lingered on Isaac, narrowing slightly as he took in the young man. Even the faint wrinkles at the corners of his eyes seemed to deepen intoa smile of satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, tall and striking in a dark suit, looked every inch the man of stature. Even seated in a wheelchair, he carried a quiet authority that demanded respect, radiating maturity and steadiness with every restrained movement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was, without question, worthy of the title given to him-the remarkable young CEO of Bennett Group,who had forged extraordinary success in so short a span of years.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph let his eyes remain on Isaac a moment longer,studying him carefully. Then, after scrutiny,his gaze softened into approval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised a hand and laid it gently on Isaac&#39;s shoulder -a gesture heavy with both trust and acceptance.&#34;Isaac, I can see in you the mark ofresponsibility.Verena has endured so much in these years, and as her parents, we feel a deep guilt for failing to shield her from life&#39;s storms.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Joseph&#39;s voice grew husky with affection as he continued, &#34;But now, she has returned to us, and she brings you by her side. That tells me this is her choice,and it is also destiny&#39;s arrangement.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused, fixing his gaze on Isaac, his eyes sharp. &#34;I hope you can give her enough love and respect, and stand as her pillar when she falters. Do not let her carry burdens alone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He added, with a quiet edge of warning, &#34;The  Sampson family will never permit our precious daughter to suffer even the smallest grievance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Receiving Joseph&#39;s heartfelt words, Isaac nodded firmly. &#34;I take your words to heart. I will treat Verena with unwavering love and care, cherish her every day,and never give you reason to doubt me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that moment, Luis returned, his phone in hand,walking quickly toward Verena. &#34;Verena, I&#39;ve already sent all the medical records to your email. If there&#39;s anything missing,just let me know anytime.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded in acknowledgment before turning back to Joseph. &#34;Dad, I&#39;d like to return to my hospital as soon as possible to study Mom&#39;s condition carefully.I also plan to consult with some doctors who have treated similar cases, hoping to create a plan most suited to her recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands rested gently on Isaac&#39;s wheelchair handles as she added, &#34;Isaac and I will take our leave now.Please,you and Luis must care for yourselves as well.We&#39;ll stay in touch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had already exchanged contact details earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Joseph&#39;s heart resisted letting her go,he knew her purpose and felt both gratitude and worry.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded, saying, &#34;Good girl. Go now, and take care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If anything arises, reach out at once.&#34; The driver delivered lsaac to his company, while Verena arranged for her own meeting with Luther,providing the address along the way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she stepped into the café, she saw Luther already seated,waiting patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hurried toward him, bowing slightly in apology.&#34;I&#39;m so sorry. The traffic held me back. I hope you weren&#39;t waiting long.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Luther looked up, his face brightening into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rose at once, pulling out a chair with courtesy,his voice gentle. &#34;No problem. I also just arrived.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they both sat down, the café was filled with the soothing strains of gentle music.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned forward slightly, her tone carrying both urgency and care as she began the conversation. &#34;Dr.Owen,how is my husband&#39;s condition now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had been consumed by one unexpected matter after another in recent days,leaving her little chance to properly learn about Isaac&#39;s latest state of mental health.</p>
