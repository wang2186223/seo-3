                <p>The moment Verena stepped into view, Alec&#39;s and Laura&#39;s expressions shifted in an instant. Both looked genuinely startled, their faces glowing with excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec shot upright so quickly that the bottle of coffee beans toppled onto the table and tumbled to the floor,but he made no move to clean up the mess. His hands fumbled across his jacket, and he straightened his shirt in an anxious rush.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ignoring the shattered coffee cup at his feet, he strode straight for the doorway. He grinned and called out,&#34;Verena, you&#39;re finally back. Of course you&#39;re welcome here! It&#39;s about time you came home.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, his thoughts twisted in every direction. The memories of what happened during her hospital&#39;s opening ceremony still left him uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t forget how furious he&#39;d felt after Verena&#39;s outburst, thinking she had gone too far and dragged his reputation through the mud in front of everyone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet even as anger bubbled up, a thread of worry ran alongside it. Verena&#39;s position in the world had changed overnight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her new title as Isaac&#39;s wife, everyone suddenly looked at the Willis family differently. The stories about her healing skills had drawn the city&#39;s most powerful families to their door, each one hoping for an introduction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>None of that would have happened without Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec understood this better than anyone. As long as Verena stood with them, the Willis family&#39;s future in high society was safe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her here now, Alec&#39;s first instinct was to believe she finally realized where she belonged. He imagined she had set aside her resentment and chosen to make peace for the family&#39;s sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter what happened, Verena was still his daughter. Who else would know her as well as he did? At the thought, a smug smile crept across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With Verena ready to bury the hatchet, it would be foolish to bring up old arguments or show any resentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That thought made his smile grow even wider.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the room, Laura flung hér scarf onto the sofa and hurried over, a bright smile lighting up her features as she exclaimed, &#34;Verena, what do you mean? Of course we want you here! This will always be your home.Your father and I couldn&#39;t be happier to see you back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind Laura&#39;s warm greeting, her mind was racing. She had never felt close to this daughter who grew up so far from home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But those old feelings didn&#39;t matter now. Laura knew full well that Verena was their family&#39;s lucky charm,and it would be foolish to riskupsetting her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that Verena had come back on her own, Laura saw a golden chance to finally repair the distance between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura could not risk being anything but sweet to Verena. If she angered her now, all the comforts and privilege she had gotten used to might vanish in a heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Alec and Laura wore wide, practiced smiles, their eyes shining with a show of warmth and devotion that bordered on theatrical.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beside them, Kylee watched carefully, eager to leave a good impression. She bent at the waist, her smile extra bright, and said, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, it&#39;s such a relief to see you back. Your parents haven&#39;t stopped hoping you&#39;d return.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words dripped with flattery, each one sounding more forced than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze swept past Alec and Laura, her expression cool and unreadable, as if she was simply observing two people she barely knew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a faint smirk that never touched her eyes, she replied,11|sthat really what you believe?&#34; born your daughter?&#34;That hint of sarcasm landed, and Alec&#39;s smile faltered before he could catch himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He recovered quickly and responded, &#34;Come on, Verena. Of course we mean it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to keep things light, almost teasing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura jumped in right after him, her hand starting to reach for Verena&#39;s but stopping halfway, uncertainty flickering across her face. &#34;That&#39;s right, sweetheart. You&#39;re our daughter. Who else do you think we&#39;d be missing if not you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone rang out loud and sharp, her smile stretched a little too tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut her off with a question of her own. &#34;Your daughter, you say? Are you so sure about that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes held steady on Alec and Laura, as if she was searching for answers only they could give.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confusion swept over both of them as they traded glances, each trying to figure out where Verena was going with this.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec was the first to gather himself, drawing a shaky breath, irritation flashing across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He fell back on his usual authority, hoping to put an end to Verena&#39;s odd questions. &#34;Verena, what&#39;s gotten into you? Why would you say something so ridiculous? Your mother gave birth to you. There&#39;s no doubt you&#39;re our daughter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even as he spoke, Alec&#39;s instincts, sharpened by years in business, told him something deeper was at play from the moment Verena opened her mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something unsettled twisted inside Alec, as if he could sense a storm brewing just out of sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about Laura&#39;s confusion felt reassuring. She eyed Verena warily, trying to guess the motive. &#34;Has someone been whispering in your ear? Is that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stone-faced, Verena faced them without blinking. Her voice cut through the room, cold and unyielding &#34;Stop worrying about what people might have said. I just need you to answer me. Was I really  The sound of her question hung in the air,sharp and heavy, rattling both Alec and Laura. Anxiety crept into their faces as they struggled to grasp what Verena truly meant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sudden rush of fear shot through Laura, her mind flooded with the blaring warning that something was terribly wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thoughts chased each other around her mind, each one darker than the last. What if Verena had only returned to cut ties forever?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Losing Verena would mean losing everything-the prestige, the attention, the doors that her presence opened. Laura could not stand the idea of watching all her comforts slip away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No way. Laura vowed that she would do whatever it took to keep that from happening.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With barely a pause, Laura nodded frantically.&#34;Of course, Verena. I carried you for nine long months. Don&#39;t ever doubt that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trying to seem gentle, she closed the gap between them, eyes shining with a tenderness that felt anything but real.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hand reached out, aiming for Verena&#39;s arm, but Verena shifted away before she could make contact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left hanging, Laura&#39;s hand wavered in the empty space. She started to pull back, but Verena&#39;s fingers shot out and wrapped tightlyaround her wrist.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The grip wasn&#39;t forceful, but eerily cold, and the chill seemed to burrow under Laura&#39;s skin, making her flinch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec&#39;s frown deepened as he watched, voice turning stern. &#34;Verena, what are you trying to do?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t flinch. She stared straight at Alec, her gaze unwavering and sharp, completely shut offfrom any trace of family warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you&#39;re so convinced, then let&#39;s put it to the test. I want answers-and science doesn&#39;t lie.&#34; Her declaration echoed through the room, calm and unshakeable.</p>
