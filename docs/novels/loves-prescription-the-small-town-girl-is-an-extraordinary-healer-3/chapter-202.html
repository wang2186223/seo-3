                <p>Verena chuckled at the phrase &#34;knight in shining armor&#34; as if it were both ridiculous and charming at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lingered in easy conversation with Miranda, their voices weaving together in lighthearted chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence in the bedroom was so complete that the faint echo from the phone&#39;s receiver stood out with striking clarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had emerged from the bathroom, still drying his hair, and caught the tail end of what was being said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the words drifted to him, his chest gave an unexpected jolt, and his heartbeat began to beat faster.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena answered Miranda, her tone made his pulse stumble in disbelief. &#34;He&#39;s my husband, Miranda. Trusting him isn&#39;t a choice-it&#39;s a certainty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rang with pride, soft yet radiant with happiness, and every bit of it reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac realized she wasn&#39;t pretending for anyone&#39;s sake.She meant every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The corners of his mouth lifted in a smile as he let that truth sink in.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Contentment rolled through him, thick and warm,wrapping him in the certainty of her faith in him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had begun to notice subtle signs that she was thinking more about him lately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it mean she was beginning to feel something deeper for him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t dare to push his luck. Having this moment, just as it was, already felt like more than enough.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two ladies&#39; conversation drifted lazily between  topics until Verena caught a flicker of movement in the glass of the windows.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There, in the reflection, Isaac sat motionless in his chair, his eyes fixed steadily on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His focus was so deep that he didn&#39;t realize she had already noticed him watching.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A playful curve touched her lips as she spoke into the phone. &#34;Alright then. We&#39;ll stop here for now. We can talk more when we&#39;re both free.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she ended the call and set the phone aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she turned, her head tilted slightly, and a teasing lilt colored her voice. &#34;Tell me, Mr. Bennett,how long were you planning to spy on me from over there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I could spend my whole life watching you,&#34; said Isaac, his dark gaze locking with hers while a smile tugged at his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not long ago, such a direct call-out from her would  have left him flustered and tongue-tied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, though, he had found his footing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could sense the shift in her, faint but unmistakable, as if she were beginning to care for him in ways she hadn&#39;t before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That fragile spark was enough for him to cling to, and he silently vowed to let her see the depth of his devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes widened slightly as she was startled by how smoothly he had turned her jab into something bold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had meant only to tease him, yet here he was,tossing back a line that made her heart skip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft laugh as she strolled over, lowering herself onto his lap as though it was the most natural thing in the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn&#39;t you say a word? You didn&#39;t even bother to ask me to come closer.&#34;  Isaac&#39;s arms instinctively circled her waist, pulling her against him. &#34;You were busy talking to your friend. I didn&#39;t want to cut in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes glimmered with mischief as she tilted her head. &#34;So you heard all of it, didn&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave a slow nod, the corners of his mouth betraying the satisfaction he didn&#39;t bother to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching that look, she arched a brow. &#34;And now you&#39;re pleased with yourself, huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips curled into a teasing smile, and the playful gleam in her eyes reminded him of a child who had just pulled off a trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Isaac bent forward and captured her mouth, his kiss making it clear how thrilled he was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm...&#34; A muffled sound escaped her throat,startled yet sweet, before his kiss swallowed the rest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Feeling Verena&#39;s clear affection for him stirred something deeper in him, a need that grew harder to control.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His breath grew ragged as he pressed closer, desire coursing hot through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ah...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment threatened to deepen, but Verena suddenly pressed against his chest and bolted toward the bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, staring after her in disbelief. Had she really just shoved him away?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had she been so repulsed that she actually felt like throwing up?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered on the closed bathroom door,unease knotting in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was she truly that uncomfortable with him?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No... that couldn&#39;t be it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brushed a hand across his mouth, remembering the sweets he had eaten earlier that evening.  Maybe the lingering taste had turned her off?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But then again, he had already brushed his teeth and even used a freshener.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no way a trace of it should have remained.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, a wave of embarrassment burned through him, tinting his ears pink.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of hesitation, he wheeled himself quietly to the bathroom and sat there debating.Finally, he raised his hand and gave the door a soft knock. &#34;Verena, are you alright in there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gripping the edge of the sink for support, Verena gagged a few times,though nothing came out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac&#39;s voice drifted through the door, she glanced over her shoulder. &#34;It&#39;s alright. My stomach just flipped for a bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She twisted the faucet on, cupped her hands beneath the stream, and rinsed her mouth with cool water. While the water slipped through her fingers, a sudden thought struck her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For someone as meticulous about her health as she was, random nausea wasn&#39;t common. Regular checkups always kept her in the clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be...pregnancy?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The idea startled her, leaving Verena staring at her reflection in disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cycle was already three days late, but three days alone wasn&#39;t proof of anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick shake of her head, she told herself she would schedule a hospital visit tomorrow to be certain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no need to mention it to lsaac yet. She didn&#39;t want to spark his excitement only to have it mean nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After taking a steadying breath, she turned off the tap and stepped out of the bathroom. The moment he saw her, lsaac&#39;s voice came out tense. &#34;Are you really okay? Should I call a doctor to check on you?&#34; She dismissed the suggestion with a wave of her hand. &#34;No, don&#39;t fuss. I just need some water, and I&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relieved but still cautious, Isaac gave a slow nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she stepped out to get a glass of water, Isaac slipped into the bathroom, grabbed a cup, and began scrubbing at his teeth all over again without a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time Verena came back carrying a glass of water, she caught sight of him still bent over the sink,toothbrush in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Setting her glass down, she frowned in amusement.&#34;You&#39;ve been at it forever. What on earth are you still brushing for?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the sound of her voice, he turned his head, letting out a muffled &#34;Hmm?&#34; through a mouthful of foam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bristles kept moving, his words swallowed in   toothpaste and bubbles, making his usually composed self look surprisingly awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight made him seem far less intimidating than usual, and oddly enough, there was something almost adorable about it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could get another word out, she pieced the whole thing together, remembering how she had rushed off earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning casually against the doorframe, she let out a laugh. &#34;Wait... do you honestly think I ran off to throw up because of our kiss?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His toothbrush stilled, and he muttered through the foam,&#34;Wasn&#39;t that it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His·brows knitted together, a faint shadow of hurt flickering in his expression, leaving him looking both troubled and strangely pitiful.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to stop herself, Verena stepped forward,resting a hand on his shoulder as her laughter softened. &#34;Of course not. We&#39;ve kissed plenty of  times. Why would I suddenly feel sick from that? As for the real reason-well, I&#39;ll tell you tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied the sharp lines of his face, and then gave his cheek a teasing poke before leaning close to whisper, &#34;Rinse that foam off first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment her words confirmed it hadn&#39;t been about the kiss, relief washed over lsaac, loosening the tension that had gripped him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint grin tugged at his lips, unguarded and genuine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without protest, he bent over the sink, swished water around his mouth, and wiped away the last traces of toothpaste.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could straighten fully, Verena brushed a quick kiss against his lips, light as a feather.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My husband is the cutest,&#34; she said, her tone sweet but threaded with playful warmth. Color bloomed across his ears at the unexpected praise, betraying the shyness he couldn&#39;t quite hide. Noticing it instantly, Verena tilted closer, pressing a soft kiss against his ear just to fluster him more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That playful kiss against his ear unraveled him completely, sparking a rush he couldn&#39;t contain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest tightened, and in one swift motion, Isaac hauled her into his embrace, clutching her as though she was the only thing that could steady him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Holding her like this felt like staking a silent claim-like she was his, and would always remain so.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re the one who started this,&#34; he murmured, his voice low and rough, before pressing a trail of kisses -first to her forehead, then the tip of her nose, and finally her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, the balance between them shifted,and it was he who pressed forward, leading the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sensed exactly where his touch was headed,yet she caught his wandering hand and shook her head. &#34;Not tonight, Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice trembled, raw and breathless, betraying  both want and restraint. He lifted his gaze, eyes slightly bloodshot, a question flickering in the depths.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Why pull away now, after teasing him like that?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the frustration in his expression, she leaned close, her lips brushing his ear. &#34;Wait until after l&#39;ve had my checkup tomorrow. I&#39;ll tell you everything then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Silence lingered as he processed her words, his jaw tight, his thoughts racing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it mean...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A spark lit in his gaze, the possibility striking him al at once. &#34;Could it be that you...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before he could finish, Verena pressed a finger gently against his mouth. &#34;Shh. Don&#39;t let your hopes run too high just yet-it might turn out to be nothing.&#34;</p>
