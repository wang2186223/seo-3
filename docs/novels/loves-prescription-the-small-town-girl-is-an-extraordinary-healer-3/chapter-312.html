                <p>In the main hall, though the party had yet to officially commence,the hall already thrummed with a low hum of conversation and the gentle shuffle of footsteps,like waves lapping at a quiet shore.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, weary from the twin companions of pregnancy-fatigue and hunger-rested comfortably on a sofa in the lounge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her side sat Isaac, holding a bowl of freshly prepared cereal he had just ordered from the kitchen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clad in a perfectly tailored black suit that accentuated his tall, graceful frame, he carried himself with quiet dignity; the silvertie clip at his collar caught the light with a discreet gleam.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With steady hands, Isaac lifted a spoonful of cereal,blew on it gently, and offered it to Verena, his eyes filled with tenderness. &#34;Here, try this. The temperature should be just right.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a soft, sweet smile as she opened her mouth obediently, tasting the food. &#34;Hmm,it tastes wonderful,&#34; she murmured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her, deep and steady, as if a tranquil lake had mirrored his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He raised another spoonful to her lips. &#34;If you like it,have some more. It&#39;ll give you the strength you&#39;ll need for your speech later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded lightly, savoring each bite with deliberate calm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After swallowing, she looked up, her smile radiant.&#34;Don&#39;t worry, love. The baby hasn&#39;t made any fuss today. I&#39;m feeling just fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing this, Isaac&#39;s lips curved in quiet relief. He unfolded a paper napkin and carefully dabbed the corner of her mouth. &#34;That&#39;s good.Seems our little one already knows how to care for their mother. Still,you were on your feet quite a while greeting the guests. Once we&#39;re home tonight, I&#39;ll massage your feet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena responded with another warm smile, her eyes glistening with contentment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The return of the Sampson family&#39;s daughter had already stirred quiet waves of attention. Since Verena&#39;s entrance, many eyes had discreetly followed her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now, seeing this tender exchange, the onlookers &#39; curiosity deepened, their glances growing more frequent. Not far away, a young woman in a sleek black gown whispered to her companion, envy lacing her tone,&#34;Who would have thought the Sampson family&#39;s daughter would marry such a remarkable man? Even though he&#39;s disabled, he&#39;s striking,broad-shouldered,and-above all-devoted. Look how he gazes at her;it&#39;s as though they&#39;ve stepped out of a romance film.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her companion followed her gaze, catching Isaac&#39;s affectionate eyes fixed on Verena, as though the entire world had shrunk to just the two of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The companion nodded thoughtfully. &#34;Indeed. Yet somehow,I feel I&#39;ve seen her husband somewhere before.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She frowned, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, across the room, a woman adorned with a glittering diamond necklace widened her eyes,her voice rising in astonishment. &#34;Isn&#39;t that Isaac Bennett,the heir of Shoildon&#39;s most powerful family?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words rang clear, drawing countless heads in their direction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her side, a bearded middle-aged man let out a teasing chuckle. &#34;You&#39;ve only just realized? Isaac Bennett usually keeps a low profile, but tonight he steps into the light-just to accompany his wife.Seems the rumors about him being a &#39;devoted  husband&#39; hold water after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had he spoken than a ripple of exclamations swept through the hall, and discussions erupted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So he&#39;s the young CEO of Bennett Group, the one who carved his name in the business world at such a young age-even that terrible car accident never dimmed his brilliance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged gentleman in a sharp suit shook his head slowly, admiration shining in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I never imagined the Sampson family&#39;s long-lost daughter would be his wife.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;True,&#34; a short-haired woman chimed in. &#34;Word has it that under his leadership, Bennett Group leapt into overseas markets within mere years, expanding its influence far and wide. It&#39;s no stretch to call him a rising star.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, an elderly man leaning on a cane, his hair silvered by time, spoke in a measured drawl.&#34;The achievements of this couple leave us all in their shadow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words drew every gaze toward him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Dressed in a finely cut suit with ornate buttons glinting at his collar, he radiated authority and quiet respect. He was Emiliano Ramsey, a towering figure in the Ochrerayd business circle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young man in a gray suit could not resist asking, &#34;Mr.Ramsey,what makes you say that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emiliano&#39;s lips curved into a knowing smile. &#34;Take Isaac, for example. He was not yet twenty when he stormed into the business world, daring to confront seasoned giants. Back then, the financial arena was turbulent; established powers closed ranks to choke out fresh blood. Yet Isaac did not shrink back-like a calf unafraid of the tiger, he leapt straight in. Through bold and innovative moves, he carved out Bennett Group&#39;s place in finance and triggered reforms that reshaped the industryitself. Legend after legend was born of his defiance. Tell me,how many can match that courage and wisdom?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A murmur of agreement swept through the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Emiliano paused, his eyes sweeping the guests with meaning, before adding, &#34;And Verena-she is no ornament clinging to her husband&#39;s success. Perhaps you haven&#39;t recognized her yet. She is Evelyn Rowe,the internationally renowned medical expert.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, silence blanketed the hall, broken only by startled gasps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All eyes turned toward Verena,filled with disbelief. &#34;I knew she looked familiar, but I couldn&#39;t place her.So she really is Evelyn!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young woman clapped her hand over her mouth in astonishment. &#34;Heavens! I&#39;ve heard of Evelyn&#39;s genius -curing impossible illnesses, developing anti-cancer drugs. Who could imagine she&#39;s the Sampson family&#39;s lost daughter?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man in gold-rimmed glasses adjusted them, his tone brimming with respect. &#34;Indeed. At last year&#39;s International Medical Forum,Evelyn presented her groundbreaking work on precision medicine-causing a global sensation, giving hope to countless patients.To think this legendary figure now stands before us.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Among the guests, a female doctor trembled wvith excitement, her voice unsteady. &#34;She&#39;s been my idol for years. I&#39;ve studied her papers over and over,learning so much. What an honor to see her in person tonight!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Sherwood had been quietly observing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Emiliano unveiled Verena&#39;s identity as Evelyn,he faltered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The crystal wine glass in his hand froze mid-air; the red liquid rippled gently, betraying the shock etched across his face.</p>
