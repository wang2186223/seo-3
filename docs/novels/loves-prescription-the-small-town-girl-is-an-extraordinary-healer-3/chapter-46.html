                <p>Isaac reached the floor where Verena was staying,instructing his assistant to remain downstairs while he rolled toward the door whose number she had sent him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment he pressed the doorbell, it swung open from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing that caught his eyes was a pair of long,slender legs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac froze, and then slowly lifted his gaze to find Verena leaning lazily against the doorframe, wrapped in a bathrobe.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her cheeks were tinted with a faint flush,softening her usually cool demeanor with an almost dangerous allure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The air was heavy with the scent of alcohol.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In that instant, Isaac realized things might not be as romantic as he had pictured in his mind.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows drew together, his voice carrying concern he himself barely noticed. &#34;Verena, what happened to you?&#34; Worry shone clearly in his eyes, but she only smiled lightly. &#34;Come in first, and I&#39;ll tell you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone was gentle, her voice almost syrupy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t care about keeping any distance; it felt as though he were under her spell as he maneuvered his wheelchair into the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a soft click, VVerena shut the door, and then turned and promptly seated herself on Isaac&#39;s lap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Isaac stiffened, instinctively trying to push her to her feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet she looped her arms around his neck, pressing a finger against his lips. &#34;Shh. Don&#39;t ask about that now,alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slightly hazy eyes melted away the last of his resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a quiet voice, he asked, &#34;Then... what do you want to talk about?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What should we talk about...&#34; She seemed to truly think it over, her gaze roaming across his face before it lingered on his thin lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her mouth curved into a sly smile as her finger trailed from his lips down to his chin, tipping it up.&#34;How about flirting with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her playful tone, sweet and teasing, brushed against his ears as her warm breath fanned his cheek.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was certain she was drunk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena squinted at him, noticing the flush creeping over his ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As though she had uncovered some delightful secret,she teased softly, &#34;Do you want to know how I&#39;ll flirt with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before lsaac could muster an answer, she leaned closer, whispering, &#34;Your ears are red.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,with parted lips, she captured his heated earlobe,her damp tongue gliding across it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s arm muscles twitched uncontrollably,his hands clutching the wheelchair&#39;s armrests in a desperate bid for restraint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sensation of her moist lips, the warmth of her breath, and the delicate fragrance clinging to her freshly bathed skin collided all at once against his nerves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tipped his head back, taking a deep breath as though wrestling with the tide rising within him. But Verena wasn&#39;t satisfied. Once upon a time,a single kiss from her would have sent him reeling with joy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With mischief in her eyes, she cupped his face, turned it toward her, and brushed her lips against his.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A feather&#39;s touch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s heart pounded in disarray, his eyes darkening with emotion. &#34;Verena,you&#39;re drunk.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed herself tightly against his chest. If she were sober, she might have heard the thunderous chaos of his heartbeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Really, Isaac?&#34; Verena murmured, her head sinking onto his shoulder. &#34;I&#39;ve teased you so much, yet you won&#39;t react. My heart might just shatter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was husky, threaded with tenderness,carrying his name like a plea.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, could you please get up?&#34; he asked,shifting uncomfortably.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hair brushed against his Adam&#39;s apple, sending an involuntary shiver through him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; she agreed softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked in surprise, not expecting her to comply so easily. When he looked at her, she tilted her head back, smiling faintly. &#34;Let&#39;s go to bed together. I&#39;ll help you in,and youI can sleep beside me tonight, alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sleep beside her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her drunken smile and dreamy eyes locked on his,Isaac&#39;s brows furrowed. He placed his hands firmly on her shoulders and reminded her, &#34;Do you even know what you&#39;re saying? I am not like other men.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as much a reminder to her as it was to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze clung to her, shadowed by complex emotions and a touch of melancholy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was so perfect, yet he felt like a hollow shell. His legs were still unhealed, his body betrayed by dysfunction, and the road to recovery was uncertain.How could he dare hope?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing the sorrow flickering in his eyes, Verena pressed her finger gently over his lips. &#34;Isaac, I won&#39;t allow you to speak of yourself that way, nor will I let you belittle my abilities.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned her forehead against his, smiling with quiet certainty. &#34;I promised to heal you-every part of your body.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried a sharper meaning, sinking deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stared at her radiant smile, and, as always, herpresence lit up the shadows clouding him. His gaze lingered; their closeness left him suddenly aware that her white bathrobe had slipped from her shoulders baring smooth, delicate skin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sight was laid bare before him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He quickly turned his face aside, leaning back as if to retreat-only tocollide with the crescent-moon curve of her eyes. She smiled impishly, like a sprite caught mid-trick.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena continued to hold his gaze, unwavering.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence grew thick, the air pulsing with sparks of unspoken tension.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,lowering her head, she twined her arms tightly around his neck and pressed her lips to his. This time it was no fleeting brush. She nibbled, sucked, and kissed with heated persistence. It was exactly the way Isaac used to love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sudden fervor left Isaac reeling, fearing he might be swept away. Yet the sweetness on his tongue filled his mind with joy so pure it felt like a rare gift-hers alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All reason slipped away</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was no longer passive. One hand cradled her head the other locked around her slender waist, tightening as he deepened the kiss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was taken aback, pulling back to speak, only for him to chase her lips instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mmm-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This was no gentle peck; it burned with passion</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though it was hard to keep up, Verena reveled in the familiar heat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if lsaac had never lost his memory.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The kiss deepened, his lips prying hers apart with a hunger that demanded surrender.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She tilted her head back, responding with equal fire.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the hushed room, the sound of their kisses rang out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bodies pressed close, breaths tangled,as though they wished to fuse into one.</p>
