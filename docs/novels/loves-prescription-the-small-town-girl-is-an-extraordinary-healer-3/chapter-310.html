                <p>The party venue shimmered beneath dazzling lights,alive with a chorus of laughter and chatter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis strode toward Miranda with easy confidence,hands tucked in his pockets, carrying himself with the calm of a man who owned the moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s gaze followed him, noting the glint of playful defiance in his manner as he exchanged a few words-likely probing Miranda about her intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda did not answer at once; instead, she studied him with a smile that was subtle yet layered with meaning.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis knitted his brows faintly, and Miranda leaned in,whispering something against his ear-a gesture both intimate and enigmatic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Surprise flickered across Luis&#39; features; his deep-set eyes locked on hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For an instant, it felt as though time itself had drawn to a halt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; expression hardened with indifference, while Miranda&#39;s lips arched in a smile of assured triumph.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Verena braced for him to turn away, Luis startled her by moving first, striding toward the back garden.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda cast Verena a glance,lifted her brow in silent victory, and followed after him with practiced grace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though Molly had slipped into the party venue earlier,her eyes clung to Luis as if drawn by invisible threads.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Miranda appeared and traded glances with him,Molly-who had long nursed hidden feelings-felt her heart twist tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her instincts pricked like thorns, sensing something unusual in the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she noticed Verena chatting cordially with Miranda, even taking pains to draw Luis closer to Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sense of threat, sharp and unfamiliar, gripped Molly&#39;s chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching the two leave together, she smothered her rising jealousy with a sip of wine and approached Verena, a smile carefully stitched onto her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verenna, I saw a striking lady with you earlier. Is she a friend of yours?&#34; Molly asked, tone light as if nothing  weighed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena had little fondness for Molly&#39;s brand of familiarity,yet courtesy-and gratitude for Sherwood&#39;s kindness-kept her lips curved faintly as she answered,&#34;Yes. She&#39;s my best friend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly wet her lips with another sip,jealousy flashing in her eyes though her voice remained curious. &#34;Well,she certainly seems distinguished. And it looks like she knows Luis too. Hlave they met before?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows creased,irritation simmering at Molly&#39;s persistence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief pause, she replied evenly, &#34;They&#39;ve crossed paths at some evens, but I don&#39;t know the details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile crept to Molly&#39;s mouth as she pressed further. &#34;Verena,you&#39;re truly helpful-setting them up like that. Are you trying to play matchmaker?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Verena&#39;s gaze sharpened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nearly admitted as much, yet concern for Miranda&#39;s reputation silenced her. Meeting Molly&#39;s eyes squarely, she said with calm conviction, &#34;Miss Kirk,you&#39;re overthinking. It&#39;s nothing more than ordinary interaction between friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly sneered inwardly, though her outward smile shone as bright as ever. &#34;Perhaps you&#39;re right. I might be imagining things. Luis is extraordinary, after all,and such men draw admirers like moths to a flame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, feigning nonchalance before adding,&#34;Besides, Luis and I grew up together, and our families have always spoken of a union. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s improper to play matchmaker; I just worry that you&#39;ve been away so long you may miss the undercurrents-and unknowingly fall into another&#39;s schemes,disrupting relationships.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried barbed hostility aimed squarely at Miranda.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,keen to the venom hidden in honeyed tones,remained unmoved.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes locked on Molly&#39;s, sharp as an eagle&#39;s. &#34;Is that so? Yet my brother has said clearly he has no intention of marrying you. I assume he&#39;s told you as much himself. If you&#39;re neither engaged nor in a courtship,how couldldisruptbondsthatneverexisted?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Molly&#39;s face faltered, but she quickly masked it. &#34;So, Verena, do you truly believe your friend would suit Luis?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A dull ache throbbed at Verena&#39;s temples; she longed to change the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, her eyes caught lsaac in his wheelchair  nearby,waiting patiently.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth flooded her chest, and with a faint shrug,she told Molly, &#34;Who can ever predict the heart&#39;s course?Forgive me, I must attend to something else.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without waiting for reply, she made her way toward Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly watched her retreat, dissatisfaction flickering in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ungrateful. Insensible,&#34; she muttered,slamming her glass onto a tray, spilling droplets of wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena was right: Luis had told Molly plainly in private that he regarded her only as a younger sister, never as a bride.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But what of it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Such a matter could not be decided by the Sampson siblings alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze,Molly thought of her father-how he had lent the Sampson family tireless support in business, how he had guided Luis patiently during the family&#39;s darkest days after their daughter went missing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without her father&#39;s hand, the Sampsons would hardly stand as tall as they did now. With such loyalty repaid, what right did the Sampsons have to deny a marriage alliance?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Molly&#39;s mind, her union with Luis was not a question of if but when.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought about it, the more certain she became of her place, and her jealousy toward Verena&#39;s friend waned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena reached Isaac, took his hand,and teased lightly, &#34;Forgive me. I&#39;ve been so busy l&#39;ve neglected you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shook his head, his calloused fingertips brushing her palm. &#34;That was Sherwood&#39;s daughter, wasn&#39;t it?What did she want with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned,recalling Molly&#39;s words, annoyance weighing on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sigh, she admitted, &#34;It was about my brother.She said her family and my family had long arranged a union, and warned me not to set Miranda up with Luis,lest I ruin their plans.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows drew together, his eyes narrowing with a trace of scorn. &#34;How presumptuous. If Luis has no will for it, no power on earth can force him.&#34;</p>
