                <p>The hum of conversations and the merry clink of wine glasses formed a convenient curtain, shielding what unfolded behind the scenes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Molly quietly slipped away from curious eyes and took the elevator down to the underground parking lot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the entrance stood a black vehicle, waiting like a silent accomplice. Verena pulled open the door,ushered Molly into the back seat first, and then followed her inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the door clicked shut, the vehicle rolled forward,gliding out of the lot and into the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside,Molly seemed oblivious to the growing distance from the art museum; her mind circled only one name -Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Picking up where their lounge conversation had broken off, she leaned forward, words tumbling out in a rush. &#34;You said you&#39;d tell me about Luis. How is he these days? Why won&#39;t he answer my calls or messages? Has work worn him out until he&#39;s fallen sick?Or Her questions dried up all at once. Her throat tightened, and tears shimmered in her eyes. &#34;Or... is it because I did something wrong?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hesitated, weighing her words, before speaking softly. &#34;No, he isn&#39;t angry with you, and he isn&#39;t ilL.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She allowed a deliberate pause, and then added, &#34;He&#39;s simply been burdened with troubles, the kind that weigh heavily on a man&#39;s spirit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s brows furrowed as she pressed on, saying,&#34;What troubles? Tell me-I might be able to help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze to her interlocked fingers, Verena let out a sigh. &#34;One of Luis&#39; subordinates has blundered badly. Now a lawsuit looms over him,and prison may not be far behind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice quivered slightly, her eyes shadowed with worry. &#34;That&#39;s why Luis hasn&#39;t been eating or sleeping properly. He&#39;s lost so much weight. I may be his sister,but I don&#39;t know him as deeply as you do-you grew up at his side.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She raised her eyes and fixed them on Molly. &#34;That&#39;s why I came to you. When Luis suffers, how should ease his pain? I can&#39;t bear to see him like this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After speaking, Verena kept her gaze steady, quietly studying Molly&#39;s shifting expression. Molly, who had been consumed by worry, froze.Instinctively, she drew back, pressing against the car door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What did you just say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice rasped like a frayed thread, her coral-painted nails digging crescents into the leather seat.Her eyes flickered uneasily-first to the blur of greenery rushing past the window, then to Verena&#39;s steady gaze, and finally down to her own knees.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In an instant, memories stormed back-fragments of a phone call she had overheard in Sherwood&#39;s study only days before. Suddenly, she understood: her father&#39;s carefully laid plans were unfolding far faster than she had imagined.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her heart thundered in her chest, each beat striking with dread. Luis&#39; tender smile overlapped in her mnind with her father&#39;s stern, unyielding face. Could her father truly be so merciless?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A silent scream tore through her heart as her nails bit into her palms. Their families had once been as close as kin-how could her father trample all sentiment and strike Luis so cruelly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scenes of her past with Luis spun before her eyes:him shielding her from childhood bullies, patiently teaching her business affairs as they matured. Those precious  moments now felt overshadowed by her father&#39;s ruthless designs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she thought, the tighter her chest became,as though she were sinking beneath waves of regret and fear. She couldn&#39;t-she wouldn&#39;t-let disaster fall upon Luis.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clenching her fists until her palms stung, she forced out a hoarse whisper. &#34;It&#39;s my dad.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The low hum of the air conditioner did little to hide the uneven rhythm of her breathing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena blinked, momentarily startled, and then lowered her eyes to conceal her reaction. She hadn&#39;t expected Molly to confess so quickly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathering herself, Verena lifted her head again, just enough astonishment in her tone. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s hands twisted in her lap, crumpling the fabric of her trousers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her throat felt dry as sand; she swallowed hard before blurting through clenched teeth, &#34;It&#39;s all my father&#39;s scheme. He&#39;s plotting against the Sampsons-against Luis!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears broke loose midway, spattering onto her knees and leaving dark circles. &#34;He wants to pin smuggling charges on Luis. That&#39;s all I know-l overheard by chance. My father never told me the details, nor would he allow me to ask.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at Molly&#39;s ashen face, Verena felt a sudden tightness in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s eyes, rimmed with red, brimmed with guilt and torment for Luis&#39; sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing this, Verena&#39;s heart pricked with both guilt and sorrow. She had used Molly&#39;s feelings to reach this truth, yet she couldn&#39;t deny being moved. Sherwood&#39;s sins were his own; Molly was innocent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s sigh was soft, her voice gentler without her realizing it. &#34;Molly, thank you-for still thinking of Luis in such a moment.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly wiped her tears with trembling fingers,choking out, &#34;I&#39;d do anything for him. I just don&#39;t want him hurt.I only want him safe.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, as if struck by a desperate thought,Molly seized Verena&#39;s wrist. Lifting her tear-streaked face,she pleaded, eyes glistening, &#34;Now that I&#39;ve told you the truth-though my father has sinned-if it isn&#39;t too late,could you forgive him this once?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her sobbing words trembled like a drowning soul clutching at driftwood. &#34;He&#39;s blinded by greed, but if he stops now, things can still be mended... Luis wouldn&#39;t want me turned out into the cold, would he?&#34; Fresh tears coursed down her cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that, Verena&#39;s first impulse was to lay bare every wound Sherwood had inflicted upon the Sampsons.Yet when her eyes met Molly&#39;s tear-streaked face and trembling lips, the words lodged in her throat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She turned her gaze aside, swallowing back the sharp retort that rose within her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At length, she spoke slowly, choosing her words with care. &#34;I&#39;ll pass your message to Luis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly, blind to the storm behind Verena&#39;s eyes,heard only a promise. Her taut shoulders slackened as she brushed away her tears, smearing streaks across her cheeks, and summoned a fragile smile. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena studied her tear-dampened face and returned a faint,reluctant smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The car settled into silence, broken only by the steady sound of their breathing.</p>
