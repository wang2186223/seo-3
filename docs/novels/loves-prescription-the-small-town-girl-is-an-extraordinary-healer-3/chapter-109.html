                <p>At Miranda&#39;s words, the group of friends and family gathered close, surrounding Verena and Isaac as they descended the grand staircase.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The newlyweds got into their wedding car, followed by a convoy so long it seemed to stretch like a dragon across the road.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ceremony unfolded at the ShineHaven Grand Hotel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the bride and groom!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With the emcee&#39;s booming voice, a waiter pushed open the heavy doors. Verena wheeled Isaac along the plush carpet, entering slowly as dreamy,romantic music floated through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The vast hall glittered under the lights. Every table flanking the carpet was filled to capacity. Petals blanketed the floor, fresh roses adorned the room,and reporters stood in neat rows, waiting for the perfect shot.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The splendor and romance were just as Verena had always pictured. Halfway down, Isaac turned his head slightly and asked in a quiet tone, &#34;Are you satisfied?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His question struck a chord in Verena, making her suddenly realize something. She asked, &#34;So you planned all this? No wonder the roses are everywhere.You called last time because you didn&#39;t know what l liked.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac gave no clear answer-neither a nod nor denial.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, she whispered at his ear, &#34;I&#39;m more than satisfied.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The tender moment between them was immediately captured by cameramen nearby, and naturally, the guests noticed it too.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a corner, Kaia stared at the couple on the carpet,her fists clenching tight. Verena&#39;s every move was like a calculated step on a chessboard-she had crushed Kaia into the mud, leaving her ridiculed, while she herself soared to the summit of admiration, bathed in envious stares.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At last, Verena and Isaac reached the stage. After completing the formalities, the emcee raised his microphone toward Isaac. &#34;Now, we invite the groom to recite his wedding vows.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This,in fact, was Isaac&#39;s own request. Taking the microphone, Isaac turned to Verena and spoke steadily. &#34;Before I met you, I never imagined loving anyone so deeply. After meeting you, I never imagined loving anyone else. From this moment forward,you are my wife-sharing both my triumphs and my trials. I hereby declare half of my personal assets will belong to you. Your thoughts are my thoughts; your opinions, my opinions. Whoever disrespects you, disrespects me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena hadn&#39;t expected such a vow. Isaac was never one to flaunt wealth or status, but this was clearly his proclamation to Shoildon&#39;s elite-that he cherished her as his wife and demanded their respect.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes brimmed with tears. Bending down, she slipped the ring onto his finger.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard your vows. I&#39;ll be the best wife I can be,and together we&#39;ll walk hand in hand through every season of life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their smiles met like sunlight breaking through clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac finished, a stir rippled across the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone present understood-the first half of Isaac&#39;s vow was meant for Verena, but the second half was a declaration to the entire gathering, perhaps even to the city itself. And when Isaac openly promised to transfer half his personal fortune,shock spread like wildfire.Aside from Bennett Group,he held countless enterprises-wealth others couldn&#39;t amass in generations. And yet,he offered it away so easily?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t it said Isaac despised this marriage and even struck against Willis Group? How could he give away such a fortune? Is that what dissatisfaction looks like?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, that was the rumor. What&#39;s the truth here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But if he truly loves Verena, why move against Alec -her own father?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As the murmurs swelled, Alec&#39;s and Laura&#39;s faces turned pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At one table, Luka chewed his food carelessly,muttering, &#34;Isaac must be out of his mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s fury mounted; she ground her teeth,clutching her glass until her knuckles cracked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At another table, Barrie gazed at the couple on stage with a face full of quiet satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the ceremony, Isaac and Verena changed their attire and began making the rounds, toasting guests.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the sidelines, Kaia seethed as she watched the couple,glowing with joy amid the crowd. She ground her teeth in resentment. Why? Why should Verena have both Isaac&#39;s love and devotion? The thought gnawed at her like a stone in the shoe.She could not accept it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of her plan, Kaia let out a cold scoff. Verena could laugh all she wanted now. The higher she was lifted, the harder she&#39;d fall. When she shamed Isaac before all of Shoildon&#39;s elite, Kaia wondered if Verena could still keep that smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the room, Slater, while chatting casually,caught sight of Kaia&#39;s bitter expression-as though she were hatching a plan.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Excusing himself, he approached her with a glass of wine in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without concealing his bite, he asked, &#34;Jealous,seeing Verena happy despite all your schemes?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia shot him a glance, lips curving. &#34;Yes, I&#39;m jealous.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she swirled her wine and turned away as though dismissing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater blinked, expecting venom but receiving composure instead. Something felt wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His frown deepened-was Kaia truly plotting something? Meanwhile,Kaia,glass in hand, drifted toward a cluster of elites, taking up a spot easy to overlook. She and Verena had fallen out, so Verena surely wouldn&#39;t toast her directly. But the couple couldn&#39;t skip the others,could they?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And so it happened-Verena and Isaac drew near.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After toasting a few acquaintances, Adrian took a glance at Kaia and suddenly stepped forward, raising his glass before Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs.Bennett, I hear you&#39;re also a Pine Hill University graduate. What a coincidence. Congratulations, my alumna.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena looked at Adrian, sensing his hostility,and asked curiously, &#34;Alumna?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian replied with a smile, &#34;Yes, I&#39;m a Pine Hill University graduate, too. But it&#39;s a pity-a gorgeous fellow student like you attended university in the exact same year as me, and yet l&#39;ve never once caught sight of you or even heard a peep about you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words carried an implication that made others feel there was more to it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a young woman burst from the crowd,seizing Verena&#39;s arm. &#34;Verena, it&#39;s really you! I never thought you&#39;d do so well-marrying into wealth!&#34; she exclaimed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena looked at her in puzzlement. &#34;You are?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t you remember? We studied at the same community college, old schoolmates. We even joined activities together. Back then, we always joked you&#39;d land a rich husband because of your beauty. And now you really have!&#34; Her voice rang loud and clear,drawing attention all around.Gasps spread through the hall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wasn&#39;t Verena a Pine Hill UJniversity graduate? How does community college come into it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It must be false. Why would lsaac marry someone from a community college?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But first it&#39;s Pine Hill, then community college-what&#39;s true anymore?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What&#39;s to doubt? Likely she lied, ashamed of her education.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Listening to the murmur, Barrie&#39;s eyes narrowed.Leaning on his cane, he asked Fletcher, &#34;Who&#39;s behind this trick?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fletcher scanned the room,replying,&#34;I&#39;ll find out.&#34; Meanwhile, Verena, still held by the woman,stood calm as a lake untouched by wind, her face betraying no ripple of emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, however, fixed Adrian with a cold stare, his thoughts running deep as the tide.</p>
