                <p>Verena looked at Laura and gave a quiet laugh. &#34;I don&#39;t waste anger on just anyone. Only the people who matter get that side of me. So relax. Why would I be upset with you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way she spoke made it sound like Laura&#39;s presence was of little importance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across from her, Laura&#39;s eyes fixed on her daughter, and her expression stiffened beneath layers of carefully applied makeup. All morning she had wrestled with guilt over how she had wrongly accused Verena,and waiting here was her way of making amends. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with dismissal. Was Verena really suggesting she didn&#39;t matter? She was still her mother. But then, considering Shawna had been the one to raise Verena, it wasn&#39;t surprising. To Laura, the girl standing before her was nothing but a thankless child who threw her kindness away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had been quiet until now, but after hearing Verena&#39;s cutting remark, she rose and slipped an arm around Laura&#39;s shoulders.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;How could you talk like that, Verena?&#34; Kaia asked, frowning at her. &#34;Mom&#39;s already trying to make things right with you. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s disrespectful to speak to her this way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words weren&#39;t meant for comfort. They were meant to make Alec see Verena as insolent enough to deserve punishment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena met Kaia&#39;s gaze with a cold stare. &#34;Politeness depends on who I&#39;m dealing with. And with the two of you, there&#39;s no need for it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her glance shifted to Alec, who opened his mouth as if to say something but held back. Without another word,she turned and walked upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment Kaia stood frozen, unable to form a reply. When her thoughts finally caught up, anger took hold of her. She hated herself for always losing ground in arguments and never being sharp enough to outtalk Verena. Growing up the way she did had made Verena quick with insults, but that was all she had. On second thought, Kaia felt a flicker of relief, realizing her sister&#39;s only skill was a sharp tongue and nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Breathing hard from frustration, Laura pressed her hand against her chest. She looked over at Alec, who sat unmoving on the sofa. &#34;Can you believe this? Just look at what&#39;s become of her! How could she claim I&#39;m not worth basic respect? I am still her mother!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Laura raged, Alec&#39;s eyes stayed fixed on the floor. Regret flled him far more than anger whenever he thought ofVerena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long ago, he had planned to bring Shawna and Verena to Shoildon, but Laura&#39;s constant objections always got in the way. It was only after Shawna pasśed away that Verena finally came to live in his home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those lost years left a distance between them, and Alec had tried to bridge it as a father. Still, the gap was too wide. He and Verena had spent so long apart that it felt impossible to truly reach her now. When he heard Verena speak so coldly to Laura, he couldn&#39;t find it in himself to blame her. He only blamed himself for falling short as a father.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Interrupting his thoughts, Laura&#39;s sharp voice demanded attention. &#34;Why won&#39;t you say anything? Look at the kind of person she&#39;s become under your mother&#39;s guidance!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec drew a slow breath and met Laura&#39;s gaze. His words came out steady. &#34;You keep saying you&#39;re her mother, but was there ever a moment you actually tried to teach her the right way?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hintof offense crossed Laura&#39;s face. &#34;What are you suggesting? Do you really not remember who stood beside you back when you had nothing? I had no time to teach our eldest daughter properly because I had given you my full support back then. Are you seriously blaming me for this now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hoping to avoid an argument, Alec softened his voice. &#34;She just came to the city, so it makes sense she&#39;s unfamiliar with how things work here. As her mother, you&#39;re supposed to lead her forward, not just criticize her. You keep saying she&#39;s rude and unrefined, but let&#39;s not forget, we left her to live wih my mother for more than twenty years. If Verena had grown up with us, she would have been a different person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia almost opened her mouth to tell Alec about Verena&#39;s rudeness and the way she had shoved Luka down the stairs. But when she noticed the heavy guilt in Alec&#39;s eyes, she forced herself to keep quiet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze flicked between Alec&#39;s troubled face and Laura&#39;s contemplative look, and a bitter sense of grievance welled up inside her. Why did Verena&#39;s return seem to steal all of their attention?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That grievance soon turned into unease. If her parents kept focusing on Verena, would their love eventually belong only to her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought unsettled her even more when she remembered that Verena was set to marry Isaac, which would surely bring her even greater favor at home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Grinding her teeth, Kaia made up her mind. She would never allow that to happen. Their love had to remain hers, and their focus should never wander to anyone else.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Dad, Mom, don&#39;t let Verena&#39;s issues take over your thoughts anymore,&#34; Kaia steadied Laura on the sofa and gave a bright smile. &#34;I actually have some good news to share with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Laura quietly questioned whether she had been too harsh with Verena, Kaia&#39;s cheerful voice suddenly drew her attention back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What kind of good news?&#34; she asked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec was curious too, so he turned his eyes toward Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now that both of them were paying attention, Kaia&#39;s smile grew warmer. &#34;Not long ago, when I was eating out with a friend, I happened to meet one of my professors.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, with a touch of pride, she added, &#34;You remember-the one who&#39;s always been especially fond of me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As always, Laura remembered every detail about Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She leaned closer with a smile and asked, &#34;You&#39;re talking about Professor Wendell Branson, aren&#39;t you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia nodded eagerly. &#34;I stopped to greet him, and he ended up sharing something with me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let the pause linger on purpose, letting their anticipation build, and then went on with a bright smile.&#34;This year, our medical school is bringing in Dr. Evelyn Rowe, the world-famous physician, to give a lecture. Since Professor Branson knows how much I admire Evelyn, he saved me a place right away, worried I might miss the chance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &#34;Is that true? Didn&#39;t you once tell me Evelyn rarely makes public appearances? If your school managed to invite Evelyn, they must have gone to great lengths.And your professor holding a seat for you clearly shows how highly he thinks of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wrapped her arms around Kaia and praised her warmly. &#34;Kaia, you really are remarkable.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Enjoying every bit of her mother&#39;s affection, Kaia smiled with deep satisfaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec was pleased that his younger daughter had earned her professor&#39;s favor. And the name Evelyn stirred his curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Life is inseparable from illness, aging, and death, and regardless of how much power or wealth a person possessed, the opportunity to build ties with a doctor of Evelyn&#39;s reputation was far too valuable to overlook.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Alec had heard of Evelyn before, he realized he knew almost nothing about the doctor beyond the name.</p>
