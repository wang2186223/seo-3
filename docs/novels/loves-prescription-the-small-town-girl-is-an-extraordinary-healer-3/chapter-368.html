            <div class="content font-medium">
                
                
                <p>Verena said, &#34;You can be the one to tell your father the truth that I never treated his illness.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused, watching Molly for a reaction before adding, &#34;Any improvement he feels is nothing more than a trick of his own mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the color drained from Molly&#39;s cheeks,her anger replaced by sheer disbelief. The news left her feeling weak and unsteady.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperation took over as she gripped the desk and shouted,her voice raw, &#34;How could you do something so cruel?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She continued, her voice trembling, &#34;Did you ever actually trust our family? Aren&#39;t doctors supposed to save lives, not play games with them? You&#39;re unbelievably cruel. Don&#39;t think you&#39;ll escape the consequences-karma always catches up!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly&#39;s usual poise had vanished. Her hair was out of place,and streaks of ruined makeup marked her angry face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, Verena stayed completely composed,regarding Molly with detached indifference, as if she were just another unreasonable complaint.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Karma?&#34; Verena echoed, her tone almost amused. &#34;If karma really exists, then Sherwood should be the first to face it. What he&#39;s done is far worse than anything you&#39;re accusing me of. I only help people who deserve it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s eyes narrowed, and she spoke with deliberate precision. &#34;Sherwood lost any claim to my help a long time ago. Everything he&#39;s done to me and the Sampson family can&#39;t simply be forgiven. After all the harm he&#39;s caused, do you really expect me to just let it go and act like none of it happened?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking a slow step forward, Verena locked eyes with Molly and gave a faint, fearless smile. &#34;I have no regrets about my choice. If you want to call me cruel,then so be it. I&#39;ll carry that burden without shame.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly stood frozen, staring at Verena in shock, utterly unable to react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Elsewhere, Isaac had just finished going through the documents about Sherwood&#39;s potential investments,materials that Luis had carefully compiled. Wasting no time,he set up meetings with the key players heading the project.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside an exclusive club at Ochrerayd,the glow from a majestic crystal chandelier bathed the room in a warm light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, impeccably dressed in a tailored black suit,sat with perfect posture on a sleek leather sofa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A glass of rich wine rested on the table in front of him,its scent filling the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He brought the glass to his lips, savoring a slow,measured sip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gathered around him were the project leaders, each wearing a different expression, though worry and uncertainty flickered in all their eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With another unhurried taste of his wine, Isaac set his glass down, his movements controlled and confident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let his gaze drift across the table, and then leaned in and broke the silence. &#34;Thank you all for coming,everyone. I wanted to discuss the smart city project with you personally. With the Bennett family&#39;s support,I have no doubt we can make this venture far more successful than anyone imagined.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice, deep and commanding, carried a charisma that filled the room and left an impression on everyone present.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A ripple of unease passed among his guests as they exchanged wary looks. Finally, a portly, middle-aged man, clearly the main leader, cleared his throat and addressed Isaac with a measured tone. &#34;Mr. Bennett, there&#39;s no question about your reputation, and everyone knows the Bennett family&#39;s influence in this industry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He paused for a moment, a strained smile tugging at his lips while his brow knitted tighter. &#34;But you have to understand. Ochrerayd is the Kirk and Sampson families&#39; stronghold. Getting caught up in a dispute with either of them is a nightmare for us. Mr. Sampson has a lot of sway as well. Once we make a deal with that side, backing out would mean outright conflict.Honestly, Mr. Kirk approached us about this project a month ago. His company&#39;s credentials and financial power were more than enough, so after weighing all options, we signed with him. You stepping in now puts us in a really complicated position.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He let out a defeated sigh, the worry etched on his face making his reluctance clear.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The bald man beside him chimed in, &#34;That&#39;s right, Mr.Bennett. This isn&#39;t only about upsetting the Kirk family.In our line of work, reputation and trust mean everything. We&#39;ve already committed to working with Mr. Kirk. How could we just walk away from that agreement now? People would hear about it, and we&#39;d never recover our credibility in Ochrerayd.&#34; He gestured helplessly, as if to show how little room they had to maneuver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Throughout the exchange, Isaac listened without interruption, a gentle smile fixed in place, but there was a glint of irony in his eyes that didn&#39;t quite reach his lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone here was a veteran in business, each one sharp and calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their talk about &#34;reputation and trust&#34; was just a polished front.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth was simple. Sherwood&#39;s offer was far too tempting to refuse, and their longstanding history with the Kirk family made them wary of burning bridges.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The Bennett Group had influence, sure,but its empire was rooted in Shoildon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From their perspective, taking a stand against Sherwood in his own territory felt far more dangerous than upsetting an outside powerhouse.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze sharpened as he slowly looked around,sizing up everyone at the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rather than reply right away, he reached for the wine bottle and began to top off their glasses, moving with unhurried confidence. His unexpected gesture caught the others off guard,prompting polite words of thanks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they mumbled their appreciation, the group kept a watchful eye on lsaac, quietly trying to read his intentions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Isaac gave nothing away. His lips curled in a subtle, mysterious smile that only made them more uneasy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Has something slipped your minds?&#34; Isaac finally asked after a brief, thoughtful pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity flickered in every eye as all attention turned to him, waiting for what would come next.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;My wife is from the Sampson family; she&#39;s Luis &#39; beloved sister. You say you&#39;re worried about both the Kirk and the Sampson families, but it seems you&#39;ve conveniently left my wife&#39;s family out of your calculations. How about you talk to Luis himself?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tilted his head slightly, a knowing smile hinting at the edges of his mouth as he studied their reactions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A subtle wave of panic rippled across the table; some shifted uncomfortably in their seats, and the bald man&#39;s face went pale.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before anyone could stop him,Isaac calmly took out his phone, tapped out Luis&#39; number, and pressed the call button, all with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He set the phone on the table and switched it to speaker,his movements deliberate and sure.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hey, Isaac, what&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; voice rang out over the speaker, cutting through the tense silence in the meeting room.</p>
