                <p>Isaac could sense that Verena was teasing him deliberately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a moment, he paused, his fingers curling lightly against his knee.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He placed the phone on the stand before him, his figure looking slightly distant in the frame.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When his silence lingered, Verena smiled and urged gently, &#34;Come a bit closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That way,she could see him more clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac didn&#39;t move, so she coaxed again, &#34;Come on,just a little closer.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a softness, almost sweet enough to melt the edges of his restraint, sending a subtle tingling through his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips parted faintly, though no words came out. Still,he obeyed-bringing the phone nearer until his entire face filled the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena fixed her gaze on him, unashamedly so. She  had to admit-he was strikingly handsome. The depth of his eyes, the bridge of his nose, and the lines of his features seemed carved with intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made no effort to conceal her stare. As she herself had said, after sharing a night together,something had shifted between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heat rose to Isaac&#39;s ears beneath her burning gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he was about to retreat from the camera,Verena suddenly laughed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, your face isn&#39;t red,&#34; she said, eyes glimmering,&#34;but your ears are.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her tone rose with a playful lilt, laced with a subtle charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac avoided her eyes, his gaze sliding downward-only to catch sight of something unintended. His pupils widened in surprise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, staying in the hotel room, was dressed in a thin robe. While she lay on her stomach on the bed,her movement caused the neckline to slip open,revealing a generous curve of her tender, rounded breasts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s breath stalled. The image consumed his thoughts, pulling him back to the memory of last night-her warmth, her scent, the weight of her leaning against his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing where his mind was drifting, he frowned slightly, lips pressed tight as if to guard against temptation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His Adam&#39;s apple shifted visibly as he tore his gaze away from the sight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of his eye, he noticed Verena reaching toward the camera, as if trying to touch him through the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a low, husky voice, he asked, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, bold as ever, answered without a trace of shyness, &#34;I&#39;m imagining touching your Adam&#39;s apple through the screen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On his side, Isaac&#39;s head was tilted slightly upward,exposing the clean lines of his neck. His Adam&#39;s apple,prominent and smooth, rose and fell in view,tantalizing under her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her straightforwardness left Isaac blushing,yet instead of discomfort, another thought slipped in-did she like it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her fascinated expression, he felt a quiet sense of peace. For a man like him, having something she liked was already more than enough. After a brief daze, Verena recalled something and said,&#34;Oh, in a couple of days, it&#39;s time for your treatment again. I don&#39;t feel like going out lately, so why don&#39;t you come over instead? Just have your assistant bring the medical kit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s expression stiffened for a beat, and then he nodded.&#34;Alright.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his shyness creeping back, Verena smoothly changed the subject.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She glanced behind him and asked, &#34;Are you still working at this hour?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to himself, Isaac answered, &#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;And have you had lunch?&#34; she asked again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head.&#34;Not yet.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned lightly, her tone tinged with genuine concern. &#34;Then eat something first, and get back to work afterward.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words carried the warmth of care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked at her deeply, his gaze softer than usual.He cherished such a warm feeling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Did you hear me, lsaac?&#34; she pressed, seeing him lost in thought. He pursed his lips and answered gently, &#34;Okay, I&#39;ll eat right away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Satisfied with his compliance, Verena eased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before ending the call, she reminded him, &#34;Remember,come to the hotel in two days. And don&#39;t go to the wrong place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at the call duration, Isaac lowered his head and let out a quiet chuckle.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, he pressed the intercom. &#34;Jacob, bring in the lunch.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A crisp &#34;Yes&#34; came through.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Jacob entered the office lounge, carrying the meal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he laid it out, lsaac took the fork and began eating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him, Jacob felt puzzled. Barely ten minutes ago, lsaac had dismissed lunch, claimning he wasn&#39;t hungry. What changed his mind so suddenly?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the meal was done, Isaac returned to his desk.&#34;Jacob,&#34; he called.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Yes, Mr. Bennett?&#34; Jacob stepped forward. Flipping through a stack of documents, Isaac asked casually, &#34;Isn&#39;t Willis Group opening a high-end club in the city center soon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob blinked, momentarily taken aback, and then nodded.&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning back in his chair, Isaac tapped his fingers against the armrest in steady rhythm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief silence, his voice came slow and deliberate. &#34;Tell Beckett the Willis club doesn&#39;t meet fire safety standards. It poses a major public hazard.He&#39;ll know what to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob was stunned. Beckett Clark oversaw safety and enforcement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, Jacob didn&#39;t quite grasp Isaac&#39;s aim. But once the order was spoken, clarity struck-lsaac was shielding his future wife.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob gave a crisp nod. &#34;Understood. I&#39;ll contact Beckett immediately.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Beckett wasted no time. After receiving Jacob&#39;s message,he personally led a team to the site.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sure enough, safety risks were found. The club was promptly sealed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By afternoon, the much-anticipated club was shut down before it could open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alec heard, he nearly toppled from his chair.Rage and panic flooded him, his chest tightening with such force that he hurriedly swallowed a few pills for relief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted deep, his mind spinning in confusion.He had secured every connection, checked every detail before announcing the launch. Fire safety had been accounted for-so how could it collapse overnight?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The blow came like a thunderclap, leaving his thoughts in fragments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Desperate, Alec snatched up his phone to call a friend,hoping for help-or at least guidance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After three rings, the line connected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;It&#39;s me, Alec,&#34; he blurted before the other could speak.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a brief exchange of greetings, he rushed on,&#34;Didn&#39;t I tell you a few days ago about Willis Group&#39;s new club? Out of nowhere today, we received an order to halt operations for rectification. Your network runs deep-can you find a way to help?&#34; &#34;Well...&#34; the voice on the other end trailed, troubled With a sigh, he added, &#34;Alec, it&#39;s not that I won&#39;t help.I can&#39;t. Beckett Clark himself intervened this time.Who dares go against him?&#34;</p>

Besides, with Beckett on close terms with lsaac, he wouldn&#39;t normally deny you that courtesy.&#34;</p>
