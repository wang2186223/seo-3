                <p>Slater hadn&#39;t expected things to go this way, and the blunt rejection left him stunned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s voice·wasn&#39;t just cold-it carried an unshakable finality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The response rattled Slater, and inside he cursed furiously. What the hell? Wasn&#39;t Simon supposed to be into men? Wasn&#39;t his type exactly what Simon liked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had thrown himself forward with confidence,yet Simon&#39;s reaction was beyond strange. Was this all an act of false restraint?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Remembering the bold confidence he had flaunted when Isaac assigned him this mission, Slater tightened his fist with renewed resolve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>There was no turning back now. Isaac had trusted him with this, and he&#39;d see it through no matter what.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Driven by that thought, he called out quickly, &#34;Hey,hold on a second!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Simon walked away without the slightest pause,Slater shoved down his revulsion, hurried after him,  and caught his hand. He forced a bashful smile as he mumbled, &#34;If you don&#39;t mind,could you give me your number? I just want to connect... nothing else,just as friends.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The contact sent Slater&#39;s mind into chaos. For all his years, he had never once held another man&#39;s hand,and the sensation felt unbearably awkward.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If his friends ever learned of this moment,they&#39;d laugh him into the ground.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Despite the turmoil raging inside, he kept his face composed, feigning shyness with practiced ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden grip made Simon halt in his tracks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he turned, the sight of Slater&#39;s coyness and strange, hopeful gaze churned something unpleasant in him. Revulsion rose fast, seeping into every nerve.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He ripped his hand free with sharp finality,the movement sharp and merciless, leaving no doubt about his disgust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater froze, staring at his own hand left hanging midair, confusion clouding his eyes as he searched Simon&#39;s face for an explanation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Strength radiated from Simon&#39;s movement, far more than Slater had expected. The look Simon gave him was cold, every trace of it drenched in disdain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came short and cutting. &#34;No. I can&#39;t.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another glance, he strode off, each step quicker than the last, as though fleeing something filthy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Left behind, Slater just stood there, dumbstruck,watching the man&#39;s back fade into the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A nurse soon pushed a wheelchair out from the hall,her tone kind as she asked, &#34;Sir, do you need a wheelchair?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Words failed him, so he only nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering himself into the seat,he leaned back,rubbed his chin, and tried to make sense of what had happened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had been bold, practically throwing himself out there,yet it had fallen flat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That didn&#39;t make sense. WVasn&#39;t he good-looking enough?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Confidence had always been his shield, and within moments,his brief self-doubt shifted into frustration.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No, the problem wasn&#39;t him. From Simon&#39;s expression, it was obvious this wasn&#39;t simply about disinterest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A man who truly liked other men wouldn&#39;t recoil that violently, even if he didn&#39;t find the person attractive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whether it was pushing away Slater&#39;s attempt at contact or recoiling in disgust when asked for his contact information, Simon&#39;s responses came off as openly hostile and deeply repelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way he carried himself was no different from a straight man who felt cornered by unwanted advances from another man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clicking his tongue in frustration, Slater muttered under his breath, &#34;Did Isaac mess this up? That guy&#39;s supposed to like men, but he&#39;s acting straighter than Bobby ever did.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From a hidden spot not too far away, Bobby had watched the whole exchange, his eyes narrowing as he pieced it together.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about the situation gnawed at him, though he couldn&#39;t put his finger on what felt wrong.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once he caught sight of Simon slipping out of the hospital,he hurried after him. He kept close, following Simon all the way down to the underground parking garage, figuring he&#39;d watch the man leave by car.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Simon&#39;s next action threwv Bobby for a loop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon reached the parking lot, shrugged off the jacket Slater had touched, and tossed it into a nearby trash bin with zero hesitation, like the thing was contaminated.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without missing a beat, he made his way to the restroom tucked into the corner of the garage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bobby straightened his collar, trying to look relaxed while tailing him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He wandered over and gave Simon a casual glance,clocking the fact that Simon wasn&#39;t inside a stall.Instead, he was hunched over the sink, furiously scrubbing his hands under blasting water.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was the back of Simon&#39;s left hand that caught Bobby&#39;s attention. The skin was raw and flushed,thanks to how hard he was scrubbing-Slater had grabbed that hand earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As Bobby strolled past, Simon murmured, &#34;Hell no.That guy is definitely into men. That&#39;s just messed up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words made Bobby stop for a beat, surprise  flickering across his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He pushed onward and ducked into a stall, acting like a passerby.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a couple of minutes, once the sound of rushing water faded,Bobby stepped out with his hands shoved in his pockets.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He watched as Simon disappeared down the corridor,his eyes clouded with uncertainty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hadn&#39;t Slater said Simon was into men?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon never would have looked so rattled if he was just dealing with some random admirer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It hit Bobby all at once. The only explanation was that Simon had absolutely no interest in men.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater had pushed the envelope as far as he dared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The assignment wasn&#39;t about seduction, just gauging Simon&#39;s reaction, exactly how Isaac had laid it out. By that measure, the job was done.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Bobby and Slater hung around in Isaac&#39;s office,waiting for the verdict.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Roughly thirty minutes crawled by before the meeting  wrapped up and Isaac entered his office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing his brother, Bobby could hardly contain himself. He shot forward, blurting out, &#34;Isaac, you won&#39;t believe what happened today-&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a quick wave, Isaac silenced Bobby and signaled his staff to exit the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The office emptied out,leaving only the three of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking his spot behind the desk, Isaac glanced Bobby&#39;s way. &#34;You decided to jump in, too?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words sounded easygoing, but Bobby instantly worried he&#39;d overstepped. He shot Slater a look,quietly pleading for backup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching on to the signal, Slater quickly spoke up.&#34;Isaac,please don&#39;t fault Bobby for stepping in. I was the one who asked him to lend me his thoughts. You know how sharp he is and how he&#39;s always brimming with clever plans. We managed to finish this task only because of the strategies he came up with.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered on Bobby, but a smile finally crept in. &#34;That much I know.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief washed over Bobby and he broke into a wide,satisfied grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The smile slipped from Isaac&#39;s face as he focused on  the issue at hand. &#34;So, tell me-how did Simon react?&#34;</p>
