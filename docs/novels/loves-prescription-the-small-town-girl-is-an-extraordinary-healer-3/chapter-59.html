                <p>Verena never asked Isaac to move against the Willis family, but he only did it for her sake.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For that reason, she offered no denial and gave Danica a small nod. &#34;In a sense, yes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Danica pressed her lips together, Verena added with a faint smile, &#34;Still, I doubt you asked me here only to talk about this matter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice carried a steady calm, revealing her knack for anticipating others&#39; intentions while keeping her emotions firmly in check despite the sudden probing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This level of composure was exactly what Danica respected most when dealing with people in business.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica studied her for a long moment before laughing lightly. &#34;I don&#39;t know what kind of dispute exists between you and your family, but since your marriage to Isaac is already certain, have you thought about how others will judge you if he acts against your family? And how they might criticize him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though spoken indirectly, the meaning was clear to Verena. &#34;Are you suggesting I stop him?&#34;she asked Danica inclined her head, looking satisfied. &#34;You&#39;re quick to see my point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In her mind, Verena&#39;s words meant agreement,and she assumed Verena would soon persuade Isaac to relent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted her cup, breathed in the coffee&#39;s scent,and then set it down again before meeting Danica&#39;s eyes with a serene smile. &#34;Thank you for saying that.But the fact you came to me shows you&#39;ve already argued with lsaac about this. I understand your concerns, yet lsaac is acting for my sake. I would never be ungrateful enough to stand in his way. So I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t stop him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s expression tightened, doubt clear in her eyes.She suspected Verena was using lofty words as a mask,hiding her real intentionto weaken the Willis family.To her, it was astonishing that someone so young could already be this calculating.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s fingers curled more firmly around the cup handle as she said, &#34;I never expected you to be this stubborn. Keep in mind, if lsaac truly destroys the Willis family, you&#39;ll be left with nothing to depend on in Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she finished speaking, Danica searched Verena&#39;s expression for a flicker of panic. In her eyes, the Willis family had always been Verena&#39;s foundation, both before and after her marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The mention of &#34;depend&#34; drew a hint of amusement from Verena. From the age of seven, she had lived without her parents&#39; affection. Alec and Laura had left her in Shawna&#39;s care, offering her only the bare minimum,nothing more.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her move to ShoiIdon had been for one reason alone,to tie her to the Bennett family. Every word they ever spoke to her revolved around praising Kaia and Luka while pointing out her shortcomings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Depend? In truth, she had never once known what it meant to rely on her parents.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena kept her expression soft and steady, her tone balanced between humility and confidence as she replied, &#34;You&#39;re reading too much into it. The Willis family has never been my foundation-neither in the past,nor now, nor in the future. The only support I&#39;ve ever truly had is myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A light laugh slipped from her lips as she added, &#34;No,that isn&#39;t entirely true. I have lsaac now as well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica looked at her in open surprise. Sitting tall with her slender back straight, Verena spoke with a calmness and poise that carried quiet conviction,persuasive without the slightest hint of agitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>During the entire ten minutes they spoke, Verena never once faltered, carrying herself with composed elegance and flawless delivery.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise passed through Danica as she took in the depth of Verena&#39;s character. She had expected Isaac&#39;s wife to be pliable and easily managed,someone incapable of exposing his vulnerabilities after marriage. Yet what parent wouldn&#39;t feel pride in seeing their son matched with a woman both intelligent and beautiful?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her feelings tangled, Danica lifted her coffee,drank slowly, let out a quiet sigh, and rose from her seat. &#34;Forget it. I&#39;m old now. There are plenty of matters I&#39;d rather not get involved in. The two of you can manage your own business.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rose as well, giving her a courteous smile.&#34;Goodbye, Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While returning to the Bennett Mansion, Danica&#39;s assistant kept glancing at her from the front seat,clearly holding back his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing his hesitation, Danica said, &#34;Go ahead, say what&#39;s on your mind.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Given the opening, the assistant finally spoke his doubts. &#34;Will you truly overlook the Willis family&#39;s troubles and allow Miss Willis and Mr. Bennett to act without restraint?&#34; Standing behind Danica in the coffee shop, he had caught every word exchanged between the two ladies.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Act without restraint?&#34; Danica repeated with a faint smile, her gaze drifting out the window. &#34;Isaac is nothing like Bobby. He never makes a move without certainty. We&#39;re only speaking of the Willis family. If neither lsaac nor Verena is concerned, why should I risk discord with my own son over them?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Business had always been Danica&#39;s compass, and she knew well what truly mattered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still unsatisfied, the assistant furrowed his brows.&#34;Didn&#39;t you intend for Miss Willis to stop Mr. Bennett from striking against the Willis family? Why back away now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica gave him a brief glance before responding,&#34;Do you think I care so little for lsaac? He is my son.I won&#39;t damage our relationship for the sake of outsiders. Meeting Verena was only to measure her attitude toward Isaac&#39;s actions against the Willis family.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Understanding dawned at last, and the assistant nodded slowly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That exchange had shifted Danica&#39;s perception of Verena entirely. The young woman was neither gullible nor easily swayed, and she was nothing like the ignorant figure painted by rumor. Following his most recent quarrel with Danica, Isaac ordered Jacob to keep watch over her schedule,making sure Verena would not be dragged into anything troublesome. The moment anything unusual occurred, it was to be reported to him at once.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Isaac learned that Danica had scheduled a private meeting with Verena, his gaze sharpened.Without hesitation, he opened his contacts and dialed the first name on the list.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line rang over and over without response,and by the time he lowered the phone slightly, sweat had already dampened his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac ended the call and immediately tried again,repeating the attempt again and again, only to meet silence each time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that same moment, Verena stood in the hotel corridor, searching through her bag for her key when her screen lit up, showing a list of missed calls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking closer, she realized there were eight of them,every single one from lsaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without delay, she pressed to return his call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as Isaac was about to leave the office, with his car waiting below, his phone began to ring.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He stopped his wheelchair at once, grabbed the phone,and asked directly, &#34;What did my mother tell you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena pushed open her hotel room door, only to hear lsaac&#39;s voice come through, carrying a faint edge of anxiety.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After hanging the key on the back of the door, she sat down at the desk, surprised by his tone.&#34;You already knew?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac confirmed it without hesitation before asking her, &#34;What exactly did she say?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena caught the tension in his voice and let a playful smile spread across her face. &#34;You&#39;ve been that concerned about me? You actually called more than once. Were you planning to show up at the hotel if I didn&#39;t pick up?&#34;</p>
