                <p>Verena had meant to exchange a few words with Luis. Yet the moment she stepped out of the hospital room, a faint murmur of Isaac&#39;s voice drifted to her ears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she thought it was a trick of her imagination.But when she turned her head, there he was in the flesh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, why are you here?&#34; Her voice carried a trace of weakness, the kind that lingered after an IV.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of her slightly pale face, Isaac felt his heart sink with fear. Concern gripped him so tightly it robbed him of words. At length, his voice emerged-rough, trembling. &#34;The hospital called me as your emergency contact. When I rushed here, a nurse said a pregnant woman named Verena had miscarried. I thought it was you. My wNorld nearly collapsed. Thankfully...&#34; His lashes quivered, his voice catching. &#34;Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands clutched the wheelchair armrests as if they were his anchor, trying to mask his turmoil. But the redness in his eyes betrayed the tempest within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He dared not even imagine what he would have done had the unfortunate pregnant woman been Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Verena was stunned by the rawness of his tone. Looking closer, she saw the deep worry and strain etched in his reddened eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stepped forward, her own concern rising, and gently took his cold, sweat-dampened hand. In a soft voice, she reassured him, &#34;I&#39;m alright..The doctor said I only need to rest and take care of myself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To steady him, Verena guided his hand to her abdomen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her head, she let her gaze soften, tender eyes locking onto his. &#34;The baby and I are both safe before you, aren&#39;t we? Isaac, you mustn&#39;t torment yourself with fear.&#34; Feeling the warmth beneath his palm, lsaac tightened his grip slightly on her abdomen. Slowly,the storm inside him began to ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He swallowed hard, words sticking in his throat.When he finally spoke, his voice was still hoarse with emotion. &#34;Verena... I ask for nothing else. Your safety is all that matters.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With his free hand, he gently caressed her face,thumb tracing the delicate line of her cheek. His eyes brimmed with devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena leaned into his touch, brushing her cheek against his palm. A soft smile curved her lips. &#34;I understand. I&#39;ll take good care of myself. I won&#39;t let this happen again-nor let you worry so.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the bench not far away, Luis sat quietly, observing the tender tableau.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips pressed into a thin line, an almost imperceptible flicker of discomfort at the open display of affection. After a pause, he cleared his throat, shattering the fragile hush, and walked toward Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, about the collaboration you mentioned-I&#39;ll think it over and give you my answer tomorrow. Does that work?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena nodded, her expression solemn. &#34;This is something that deserves careful thought.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she spoke, she remembered something, her eyes softening as she glanced at Luis. &#34;And thank you for bringing me to the hospital.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis allowed himself a faint smile. &#34;Merely doing what needed to be done.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, he cast a passing glance at Isaac, and then turned back to Verena. &#34;I have business to attend to.I&#39;ll be taking my leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without another word, he walked away, his figure shrinking down the corridor until it disappeared altogether.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching him go, lsaac&#39;s brows drew together,  confusion flickering in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He turned back to Verena, his voice quiet. &#34;Verena,what did he mean?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed together as she weighed her words,and then she explained, &#34;These past days, I&#39;ve been thinking. Luis has no personal vendetta against you.It makes no sense for him to strike at you directly. A rational businessman never acts against his own interest-hurting you by sabotaging himself would be sheer folly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She paused briefly, and then continued, &#34;Which leaves only one explanation: he&#39;s being used by Simon. I suspect Simon holds something over him,forcing him into obedience. With that suspicion, I tested him today. From his reaction, it seemed he tacitly admitted as much. So I proposed a collaboration. If we join hands with him and deceive Simon, we can turn the tables and break this deadlock.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac listened in silence, and then exhaled, as though a heavy burden had eased. He knew precisely what she intended.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He nodded lightly, pride flickering across his face as a smile tugged at his lips. &#34;Verena, you never fail to astonish me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her answering smile shone like sunlight breaking through clouds.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From the corner of her eye, she noticed Jacob staring at lsaac, eyes wide as though beholding a miracle. His face was frozen in astonishment,mouth slightly agape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena frowned in puzzlement, tilting her head.&#34;Jacob,what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as if he had been struck still. Only when Verena repeated herself did Jacob stir from his daze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body trembled faintly, and he raised a shaking hand,pointing directly at Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice quavered with disbelief and joy. &#34;Mr.Bennett, you... you just stood up from the wheelchair.&#34; For an instant, Verena&#39;s mind went blank, stunned into stillness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then, like a spark catching fire, joy flared across her face, her smile widening as her eyes lit up. &#34;Really?&#34;.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob nodded fervently. &#34;Yes! I saw it with my own eyes.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac himself looked thunderstruck at the words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped slowly to his legs-those lifeless limbs that had failed him for nearly a year.Astonishment and doubt warred in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was as though a man long trapped in darkness had suddenly glimpsed a shaft of light seeping through a crack in the stone, unsure if it was salvation or illusion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then memory struck: the moment he&#39;d heard Verena might be in danger, his heart had nearly burst from its cage. Panic and worry had surged through him like a tidal wave.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And in that storm of emotion, he had wanted nothing more than to run to her-to shield her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His body had responded on its own. He really had stood up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It only lasted a fleeting moment, yet it filled him with courage,with the seed of hope.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s lips trembled as he lifted his gaze to Verena.Like a child seeking approval, his eyes glistened with longing. &#34;Verena...I...I can stand ndw.&#34;</p>
