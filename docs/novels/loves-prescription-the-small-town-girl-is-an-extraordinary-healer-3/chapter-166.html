                <p>With a confident nod, Katelyn replied, &#34;Of course. The cases I handled overseas were far worse than Isaac&#39;s.If Verena hadn&#39;t stopped me back then, I would&#39;ve performed the surgery already. By now, he&#39;d be on the path to recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The certainty in her tone eased Danica&#39;s doubts,though one concern lingered. &#34;But I can&#39;t force Isaac.How will I convince him to let you treat him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching into her purse, Katelyn produced a small packet and placedit in Danica&#39;s hand. &#34;This induces a brief sleep. It&#39;s completely harmless. If you trust me,simply get Isaac to take it. I&#39;ll handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a long moment, Danica studied the packet before curling her fingers tightly around it, determination sparking in her gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If this could hasten lsaac&#39;s recovery and reveal Verena&#39;s true nature, DDanica believed she was prepared to do whatever it took.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice dropped low as she asked, &#34;When do you need me to act?&#34; After a moment of thought, Katelyn replied, &#34;The day after tomorrow. I&#39;ll send word in advance.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Other matters demanded her attention before then.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching Danica agree so quickly only confirmed what Katelyn already sensed-Danica&#39;s hatred toward Verena had reached its height.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That meant, no matter what happened in between,as long as Isaac regained his health after she performed the surgery, Danica would not hold her accountable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that assurance,Katelyn softened her expression and spoke gently. &#34;Don&#39;t be upset anymore. Trust me.When Isaac walks again, he won&#39;t defend Verena the way he does now. It&#39;s late, so I&#39;ll let you rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica accepted the reassurance and asked the housekeeper to see Katelyn out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she got in the car, the driver glanced at her reflection in the rearview mirror. &#34;Miss Fuller, do you want to head home or go to the hospital?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly curve touched Katelyn&#39;s lips as she shook her head. &#34;Take me to Stellar Restaurant.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stellar Restaurant had served as the secret meeting place for Katelyn and Kaia. At once, the driver turned the wheel and followed her instructions.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pulling out her phone, Katelyn dialed Kaia. Their arrangement was simple-Katelyn always spoke first,ensuring no one would suspect anything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment the line opened, she spoke directly. &#34;I&#39;ve got directions for you. Meet me where we always do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia replied with a short &#34;Okay.&#34; She then ended the call.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at Seraphina Villas, Kaia understood that a summons from Katelyn meant another assignment.She changed quickly and hurried down the stairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda, dusting one of the carved columns in the living room, froze when she heard the sharp rhythm of heels and ducked behind it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as Kaia slipped out the door, Rhonda reached for the landline and dialed Verena&#39;s number.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the call connected, her urgent whisper came through. &#34;Kaia just left. She seemed in a rush.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena arched a brow, amusement glinting in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So,the restless ones had finally decided to act. It was their turn to move. Her tone stayed light. &#34;Understood. Thank you,Rhonda.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After days of careful watching, Rhonda had already judged Kaia to be nothing good.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She asked hesitantly, &#34;Do you want me to follow her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile touched Verena&#39;s lips. &#34;That won&#39;t be necessary. Just pretend you know nothing.Wait,and let them show their hand first.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kindhearted as she was, Rhonda lacked the skill to tail anyone. And lately, Kaia had become more cautious.Verena believed that it was better to leave such work to those who knew how.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking Verena&#39;s words to heart, Rhonda responded in agreement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, in the quietest corner of Stellar Restaurant,Katelyn arrived ahead of time. A short while later, Kaia rushed inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking at her idol with worry, Kaia asked, &#34;Katelyn,are you feeling any better now? Does it still hurt at all?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she wanted to get straight to the matter at hand,Katelyn reminded herself that she had to remain flawless in front of Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reply came gently. &#34;The pain stopped once the stitches were in. And once they&#39;re removed, I&#39;ll be almost completely fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia bobbed her head in relief. &#34;I&#39;m glad. I wanted to come see you earlier, but since I&#39;m living at Verena&#39;s place, it&#39;s been difficult to slip away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seizing the moment,Katelyn asked, &#34;How has Isaac been treating you lately? Has he grown suspicious?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause to think, Kaia shook her head.&#34;I don&#39;t think so. He&#39;s been cold and distant the whole time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s tone sharpened slightly. &#34;Did he say anything about when Verena will return?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another shake of the head came, this time with irritation. &#34;When he&#39;s home, he barely speaks except to Rhonda. He ignores me completely, eats in silence,and then disappears into his room. From the looks of it,Verena isn&#39;t coming back soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint arch of Katelyn&#39;s brow came with a bitter laugh.&#34;Whether she returns soon or not makes no difference.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice was so quiet Kaia leaned in. &#34;What was that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Nothing.&#34; Katelyn&#39;s smile turned smooth as she said, &#34;Kaia, I have something I need you to do.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At once, Kaia straightened, eager to please. &#34;Just tell me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If not for Katelyn&#39;s earlier warning to wait, Kaia would have already tried to deal with Verena herself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Watching her eagerness, Katelyn&#39;s lips curved slightly.The pieces were aligning-only the final move was left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From her purse, she drew out a neatly wrapped white packet and passed it to Kaia. &#34;When Isaac returns tonight, pour this into his drink.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taking the packet, Kaia glanced down with curiosity in her eyes. &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sly smile tugged at Katelyn&#39;s lipsas she murmured,&#34;It&#39;s an aphrodisiac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Shock flickered across Kaia&#39;s face; she hadn&#39;t expected Katelyn&#39;s fixation on Isaac to run this deep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the reaction instantly, Katelyn tilted her chin with pride and remarked, &#34;I told you before-whatever I set my sights on, I&#39;ll claim, no matter the cost.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To Kaia, it made little sense. Why devote herself to a man bound to a wheelchair? Yet Katelyn had always been the figure she admired most,so helping her was the only choice Kaia felt she had.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head bobbed quickly. &#34;Don&#39;t worry. I won&#39;t fail you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a moment of thought, she added, &#34;Once Isaac takes it, do you need me to do anything else?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn gave a slight shake of her head. &#34;Just call me right away. I&#39;ll handle the rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Understood,&#34; Kaia replied with a firm nod.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the details were settled, Katelyn dismissed her.&#34;You should leave before someone gets suspicious about your absence.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Trusting the advice, Kaia rose and gave a quick wave.&#34;Alright, I&#39;m going.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In Clokron, at that very moment, a photo appeared on Verena&#39;s phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The image showed Katelyn with Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A message followed from Griffin Briggs, a detective,saying, &#34;Kaia met Katelyn at Stellar Restaurant. I saw Katelyn give her something that looked like a packet of medicine.&#34;</p>
