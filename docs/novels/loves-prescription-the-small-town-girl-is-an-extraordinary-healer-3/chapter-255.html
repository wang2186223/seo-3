                <p>Astrid had to concede-the cosmetic surgeon who worked on Simon was remarkably skilled. Yet, under closer scrutiny, faint traces of the scalpel still lingered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As for exactly which parts had been altered, a more deliberate study would be required.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying her nerves, Astrid seated herself across from him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon poured a steaming cup of coffee,his movements unhurried, and slid it gently toward her.With a tone as soft as silk, he said, &#34;Ms. Mills, if anything weighs heavily on your heart, you can share it with me. I&#39;m certain I can be of help.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid gave a slight nod, her fingers trembling as she  accepted the cup. &#34;Thank you, doctor,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Lowering her gaze, she took a careful sip, as though summoning courage drop by drop, and then slowly began, &#34;I... my husband... he always beats me. I live each day like walking on thin ice, never knowing when he might lose his mind. Six months ago, he struck me so brutally I nearly died. That was when l finally divorced him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes drifted away, as if she dared not stare into the abyss of those memories, her whole bearing that of a true victim.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But ever since then-these six months-l&#39;ve been haunted by nightmares. My mind feels worn thin, my temper frays for no reason. His vicious face rises again and again in my thoughts. He shadows me like a monster.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid raised her eyes, fixing them on Simon, her lips quivering. &#34;I&#39;m terrified, doctor. So terrified...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon&#39;s brow creased, but his voice remained calm,  almost soothing. &#34;Don&#39;t be afraid. You&#39;re safe here.Drink some coffee. Let your shoulders rest. Tell me-what is the fear that grips you most? I will help you untangle it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid pressed her lower lip, hesitating, as if weighing her words carefully. In truth, her mind wNas working elsewhere-how to catch the subtletes of his expression without drawing suspicion, how to discern whether he had truly undergone plastic surgery while concealing her real motive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From their exchange so far, Astrid could tell-Evelyn had not exaggerated. The man in front of her was every bit as cautious as she had warned. He was no easy nut to crack.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fortunately, Astrid had crossed paths with many psychologists before; she knew how to hold her ground with Simon.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips quivered as she muttered, &#34;He became vicious after drinking. The house would be torn apart, furniture shattered. He struck me, kicked me,and once...&#34;  Her voice faltered into silence. Simon, pen paused mid-note,lifted his head to look at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Astrid clutched the coffee cup tighter, her hands shaking as though seized by a chill. Her eyes lost focus, drifting into the darkness of some dreadful memory.Fear was written all over her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Simon leaned closer, his hand gentle on her shoulder.&#34;Ms. Mills, are you alright?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, as though jolted awake, Astrid recoiled sharply. The hot coffee spilled from the cup, scalding the back of her hand. She let out a muffled cry of pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the next instant, panic overtook her. The cup tilted,and the remaining coffee splattered onto Simon&#39;s face and pristine white coat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh no! I&#39;m sorry, doctor-I didn&#39;t mean to. I was just so frightened.&#34; Astrid leapt to her feet, panic and guilt rushing over her features. Repeating her apologies, she snatched a tissue from the table and leaned toward Simon.  Feigning nervous haste, she dabbed at the stains on his face. Yet her true focus lay on his jawline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she wiped, her fingertips brushed his jaw ever so lightly, tracing its shape, memorizing its feel.</p>
