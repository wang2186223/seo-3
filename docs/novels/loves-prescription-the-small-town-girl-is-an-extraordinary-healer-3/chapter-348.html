                <p>Verena stepped through the spinning glass doors of Sampson Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She made her way to the parking garage, found her car waiting in the shadows, and slid into the driver&#39;s seat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth wrapped around her the moment she closed the door.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she buckled up, a thought cut through her focus,demanding attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her face hardened. She reached into her bag,grabbed her phone, and scrolled until she found her chat with Luis. Her fingertips hovered above the keys before she started typing, choosing her words with care. &#34;Keep your head down while you&#39;re digging into Sherwood.Don&#39;t draw his attention-he&#39;s sharp and sees through everything. Even the smallest hint will put him on high alert. The man&#39;s practically a bloodhound when it comes to secrets.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seconds after she sent the message, a notification flashed across her screen. Luis had replied,&#34;Understood. I&#39;ll be careful.&#34; She let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she was holding, stowed her phone, and turned her attention to the quiet darkness ahead. Both hands tightened on the wheel, but her mind drifted back to Luis and Sherwood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their history went way back-Sherwood had been part of Luis&#39; life for over two decades, watching over him as he grew up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Luis entered Sampson Group, Sherwood had become his mentor, teaching him the ropes and guiding him through every company challenge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Over time, Sherwood learned nearly every nuance of Luis&#39; personality.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because their families shared a strong bond,Luis grew up seeing Sherwood as more than just a mentor; he was practically family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their shared history made it nearly impossible for Luis to probe into Sherwood&#39;s affairs without raising suspicion. Sherwood would sense it right away if anything felt off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was exactly why Verena had decided to reach out and remind Luis to tread carefully.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she mulled over the situation, a realization dawned on her. Unlike Luis, she had the benefit of anonymity. She and Sherwood had never crossed paths before she returned to the Sampson family,living in separate worlds. Even now, their encounters were rare and formal. Watching from the sidelines gave her freedom Luis could only wish for.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Night settled over Sampson Villa.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s desk lamp cut through the darkness as she worked late, the blue glow of her monitor lighting her focused face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her screen filled with files from Benedict Pharmaceuticals, each one listing names,roles, and responsibilities of major players inside the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had started her deep dive the moment she got home.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes blurred into hours, and soon the only sound left was the low hum of her laptop, keeping her company while the rest of the world slept.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she scrolled through page after page, a cluster of names kept surfacing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning in, Verena narrowed her eyes, paying close attention to every résumé, project summary, and social connection.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The deeper she dug, the more intense her gaze became. The information pointed to a strong link with Kirk Group. They didn&#39;t just show up at major projects handled alongside them. They were also regularly seen mingling with members of the Kirk family,whether it was during events or through the steady back-and-forth of contact details.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The alliance was plain as day. These people already seemed certain that Molly would take the reins at Benedict Pharmaceuticals, which was why they no longer bothered to hide their alliances.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s attention never wavered from her laptop.Ideas and strategies churned in her mind, each one more urgent than the last.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next day came with a clear sense of urgency. As soon as Verena stepped into her office, she picked up the phone and punched in an internal line. Her voice was firm, leaving no room for questions. &#34;Zeke,I want all senior executives in the conference room in ten minutes. Emergency meeting.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Zeke responded right away, his voice steady and professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News spread fast. A few senior executives quickly filtered into the break room, their voices low and uncertain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One executive, a bald man who looked tired, thumped  his mug on the table and muttered, &#34;Another emergency meeting? Verena hasn&#39;t even settled in,and we&#39;re already on our third emergency meeting.This is getting old.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A sharply dressed woman roled her eyes as she touched up her lipstick. &#34;Who knows what she wants now? She barely lets us catch our breath.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A heavyset man crossed his arms and murmured,&#34;That last meeting brought everything to a halt. How does she expect us to hit our targets when she keeps pulling stunts like this?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even though the complaints kept coming, nobody dared defy the chain of command. Everyone made their way to the meeting room before the deadline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they walked in, all eyes went straight to Verena sitting at the head of the table, her presence commanding their full attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One by one, they took their seats, each person wearing their own mix of suspicion, worry, and curiosity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Chairs scraped across the floor, some landing with heavy thumps that bounced off the walls.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the head of the table, Verena took in every detail -the nervous fidgeting, the darting eyes, the air of quiet rebellion. Her own expression betrayed nothing, carved in cold resolve. She sat up straighter, pressing her palms to the tabletop. Her fingers tapped out a slow, deliberate beat, commanding the roomn&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When the last voice faded and all eyes settled on her,she broke the silence. &#34;I know some of you aren&#39;t thrilled to be here. Let&#39;s skip the formalities. I&#39;ll get straight to the point.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Heads turned, a ripple of unease running through the group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Molly glanced over with suspicion, her eyes narrow,trying to read Verena&#39;s intent.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unbothered by the scrutiny, Verena let a thin smile cross her lips as her gaze locked on Jared,the deputy general manager.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jared lounged in his seat, arms crossed and boredom written all over his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That posture vanished as soon as he realized she was watching him. He stiffened, eyes wide, and a nervous grin stretched across his cheeks.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, is there a problem?&#34;His voice tried for casual,but it wavered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena didn&#39;t flinch. &#34;Jared, you&#39;ve been using your  position for your own gain. You&#39;ve thrown fairness out the window and broken more than a few rules. The company gave you authority to help us grow, not to serve your own interests.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Every word rang out, clear and unwavering,the weight of her authority settling over the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stopped for a moment, keeping her eyes on Jared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The color drained from his face, and the arms he had kept folded shifted nervously as he brought his hands together on the table, trying to steady them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to speak, lips parting in weak protest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut him off before he could get a word out.&#34;Effective immediately, every project you manage is suspended. There will be a full investigation into your actions. Until that&#39;s finished, you&#39;re on leave. Stay home and wait for further instructions.&#34;</p>
