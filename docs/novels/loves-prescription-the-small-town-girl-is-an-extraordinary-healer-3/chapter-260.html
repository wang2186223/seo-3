                <p>Verena replied, &#34;That&#39;s it.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She then recounted to Luther everything that had unfolded.that day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the call, Luther adjusted his glasses,surprise and relief crossing his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He explained with gentle patience, &#34;Congratulations,Mrs. Bennett. This is genuinely encouraging.After all,the human body bends easily to instinct, and when feelings run to the depths, their power is nothing short of astonishing. Think of it this way-when Mr.Bennett heard you had collapsed and believed you and the baby were in danger, his concern for you outweighed the shadow of his disability. At that decisive moment, the yearning to protect you took command-driving his body beyond limits he once thought carved in stone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luther paused, his voice taking on a note of expectation. &#34;Mr. Bennett&#39;s feelings for you are nothing short of profound. This may well be the key to his full recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Afternoon sunlight streamed gently through the sheer curtains, spilling across the bed like liquid gold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stirred awake, her thoughts slowly knitting themselves together. A glance around confirmed Isaac had already returned to the office.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The clock on the nightstand struck four.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hadn&#39;t imagined she would sleep so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a gentle knock sounded. Rhonda entered,balancing a bowl of creamy mushroom soup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mrs. Bennett, before leaving, Mr. Bennett asked me to make this for you. He said it&#39;s healthy, light, and especially good for you,&#34; Rhonda offered with a warm smile. Verena stilled for a moment, and then her lips softened into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Half-dreaming earlier, she had faintly felt Isaac&#39;s kisses graze her lips and forehead before he left.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Steadying herself, she thanked Rhonda and accepted the bowl with care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She blew gently across the surface and took a bite.The savory flavor spread across her tongue; warmth unfurled in her stomach and quietly seeped into her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bite by bite, she ate until the bowl was empty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Passing the empty bowl back, she watched as Rhonda silently accepted it and withdrew.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena rose, stretched, and walked toward the study.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, soft lamplight spilled across the wooden desk.Her expression grew solemn as she sat dówn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She moved the mouse, opened a browser, and typed swviftly. Her fingers flew across the keys. &#34;Bennett Group Chairman and CEO car Accident Details.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the time, every major media outlet had reported the Bennett family&#39;s accident. In theory, information should have been easy to find.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>News articles, forum threads-everyone had once spoken of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet curiously, after the Bennett family&#39;s intervention,the timeline blurred. Photos from the crash site had vanished.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The truth had been buried deeper than expected.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena sifted through each report with care,unwilling to miss even a thread connected to Isaac&#39;s accident.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Minutes passed like sand through a glass, but nothing useful emerged.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She lifted her glass, sipped some water, and was about to rest when a nearly overlooked local report caught her attention. She clicked instantly. And there it was-a clear time and place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Relief rushed through her veins. At last, something tangible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the hardest hurdle remained-finding surveillance footage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clearly, the Bennett family had pulled every string to hide it, determined to prevent the crash from feeding the tabloids.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together. She picked up her phone and dialed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan, are you home right now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan&#39;s voice came lightly. &#34;Yeah, I&#39;m home.What&#39;s up?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She rubbed her temple. &#34;I&#39;m digging into something but I&#39;ve hit a wall. I need your help. Hard to explain over the phone-I&#39;ll come over.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright. I&#39;ll wait for you,&#34; Ivan agreed without hesitation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she ended the call, Rhonda&#39;s voice rose from downstairs. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you&#39;re back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s movements stilled, emotions flashing in her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac could not see the wreckage of that accident-not in his state.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Swiftly, she shut the computer and hurried back to the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She exchanged her loungewear for a simple, neat outfit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stepping out of the closet, she saw lsaac entering the bedroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat in his wheelchair, his gaze sweeping over her attire. &#34;Verena, are you heading out?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She nodded. &#34;Something urgent has come up. I may be back late.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s brows furrowed, worry flickering in his eyes. &#34;It&#39;s already late. What&#39;s so urgent it can&#39;t wait until morning?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her lips pressed together. &#34;It can&#39;t wait. I have to handle it now. Don&#39;t worry-I&#39;ll return soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing her unwavering tone, Isaac said quietly, &#34;Then I&#39;ll go with you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena opened her mouth, but before words could form,his phone rang.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He glanced at the screen-Jacob.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as he moved to decline, Verena stopped him.&#34;Answer it. If Jacob&#39;s calling, it must be important.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac hesitated. She leaned close, brushing a light kiss against his lips. With a teasing softness, she whispered, &#34;Don&#39;t forget-you&#39;ve got bodyguards trailing me. Nothing will happen. Trust me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly, Isaac nodded. &#34;Fine. But be careful. Call me if anything comes up.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I will,&#34; Verena promised. With that, she headed downstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she was gone, Isaac answered Jacob&#39;s call.&#34;Speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Mr. Bennett,&#34; Jacob reported, &#34;there&#39;s been a new development.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had never believed Simon was merely who he appeared to be. From the moment he learned of Simon&#39;s connection to Luis, suspicion had taken root and never loosened its grip.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So he had kept the investigation alive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Isaac&#39;s voice sank, steady yet sharp.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob replied with respect, &#34;The Simon working at your wife&#39;s hospitaI isn&#39;t the real one. The true Simon was devoted to charity. Raised in poverty in the rural backwater, he never forgot the children still left behind. He often sent them aid and support...&#34;</p>
