                <p>Kaia burned with anger, desperate to demand an explanation from Verena for the cruel deception. Why go through the trouble of pretending to be useless,only to throw the truth back at her in the most humiliating way?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her parents said Verena quit school. They insisted she was undereducated. Yet now she stood as a proud graduate of Pine Hill University, linked arm in arm with the CEO of AuroraNexus. The whole thing felt like a bitter joke.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, Kaia swallowed her rage. She lacked the standing to challenge Verena, and she knew it. The odds were stacked against her, so she used the growing commotion as cover and started edging her way out of the crowd.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All the while, Slater never took his eyes off her. The instant he noticed her retreat, he closed the distance in a few strides, caught her by the arm, and smirked.&#34;Cause a scene, then think you can just slip away?Not so fast,&#34; he said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her panic had already left her unsteady, and his sudden grip knocked the strength out of her legs.She lunged for the table tokeep herself upright,but in doing so, she yanked the tablecloth down. In an instant, she landed on the floor as glasses toppled and wine splashed across her. Humiliation soaked her more deeply than the red stains on her dress.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The shattering glass silenced the room, every eye now locked on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From across the hall, Adrian rushed forward the moment he saw her fall. He bent down quickly and reached for her arm. &#34;Kaia, are you hurt?&#34; he asked,worry etched in his voice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena watched from her corner, idly swirling her wine with a satisfied smile tugging at her lips. &#34;So,this gentleman has ties to my sister. That explains why he went to such lengths to accuse me,&#34; she said, her tone sharp enough to cut through the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian&#39;s hand faltered, his words dying before they could leave his mouth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s pointed remark left no room for doubt,forcing everyone around them to face the truth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Whispers filled the air as curious glances turned toward Adrian and Kaia, and the tension grew heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile, the woman who had earlier boasted about being Verena&#39;s old schoolmate began to inch backward. Hoping to avoid notice, she slipped toward the edge of the crowd, praying to vanish before anyone thought to question her again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment she tried to slip away, Verena&#39;s sharp eyes caught her, and she yanked her back to stand face-to-face with Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia had stirred up trouble for her time and again,and Verena was determined not to let her escape the consequences this time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a tone as sharp as ice, Verena sneered,&#34;Who put you up to this? Who told you to drag my name through the dirt?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her questions were aimed at the woman, while her glare stayed locked on Kaia, a chill radiating from Verena&#39;s eyes with every word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The woman cast a nervous look at Kaia, her expression torn between fear and loyalty, but her lips stayed tightly sealed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That silence only hardened Verena&#39;s resolve. She twisted the woman&#39;s wrist until a cry of pain broke free.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You heard what everyone said earlier,&#34; Verena remarked, her voice cutting through the crowd.&#34;My closest friend happens to be the CEO of AuroraNexus. Think about it. Do you really want me as your enemy-or someone far less powerful?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, watching from the sidelines, felt a deep crease form in his brow. A wife should lean on her husband when things turn ugly. Yet in this moment, Verena chose Miranda instead of him. Shouldn&#39;t hebe the  one she trusted most?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze dropped, frustration weighing heavily in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The name AuroraNexus alone made the woman pale -that was why she had tried to flee earlier. Although she didn&#39;t know the company, the wary glances from the wealthy guests had told her she had picked the wrong target. She had realized Verena was not someone she could afford to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fear loosened her tongue at last. &#34;I&#39;ll confess! I&#39;ll confess!&#34; she blurted out, her body trembling.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Backing away, she pointed toward Kaia, stammering,&#34;It was... Miss Kaia Willis. She ordered me to ruin your wedding. She said to claim you came from some unknown college like me. She promised one hundred thousand dollars once I finished the job.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Gasps rippled through the hall, and the guests quickly began whispering among themselves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So Kaia was the mastermind all along.&#34; &#34;How could she do this to her own sister on her wedding day?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You must not know their story. They were raised apart, so there&#39;s no bond between them. Kaia probably wanted to drag Verena down below her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;That&#39;s right. And don&#39;t forget Slater&#39;s post. Every rumor about Verena&#39;s so-called fake background and her supposed arrogance came straight from Kaia.Let&#39;s be honest-none of us even knew Verena before this, so who else could dig up those details besides her own family? Kaia clearly doesn&#39;t care about her sister. She just wanted to destroy her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Color drained from Alec&#39;s face as the crowd whispered around him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nearby, a few of the city&#39;s elite couldn&#39;t resist piling on.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One of the influential men clicked his tongue and sneered, &#34;At the end of the day, this is nothing but family shame.Having sisters who turn on each other says a lot about the way the Willis family raised astermind them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Another man barked out a laugh. &#34;Raised them?More like trained them to compete in secret and choke on jealousy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ha-ha...&#34; The group around them erupted in laughter, their voices echoing with cruelty.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pain twisted inside Alec as their mockery cut into him like blades. His hands clamped down on his knees,but the pressure in his chest left him struggling to breathe. He couldn&#39;t stand the humiliation a second longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On unsteady legs, Alec rose and strode toward Kaia.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The gossip unsettled Laura, and she hurried after him. &#34;Where are you going?&#34; she asked, her voice tight.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec shot her a cold look. &#34;To clean upo the disaster,&#34;he said flatly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing his way through the gawking crowd, Alec stopped in front of Verena. He straightened his back and addressed the guests with a heavy voice. &#34;Everyone, my younger daughter&#39;s reckless behavior caused tonight&#39;s chaos.I ask for your understanding and hope you&#39;ll forgive her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then he addressed Verena, saying, &#34;Your sister humiliated you on a day meant for joy. I&#39;ll be taking Kaia home, and I promise she&#39;ll answer for this.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Kaia&#39;s arm was seized in his grasp, and he pulled her harshly toward the exit.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Behind them, Laura rushed forward, Luka following right after.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian&#39;s body tensed at the sight and he started to move, but a voice stopped him cold. &#34;Mr. Carter.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian turned around immediately, only to meet Isaac&#39;s unyielding gaze, sharp enough to pin him in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t have to stand to make people uneasy.Just sitting there, he carried himself with a quiet authority that kept everyone on edge.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Adrian remembered his father&#39;s warning well-Isaac Bennett never forgave insults and carried a reputation for decisiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left Adrian uneasy, and he swallowed hard before asking, &#34;What do you need from me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac raised his chin and spoke coldly. &#34;We&#39;re not finished here. Your father and I have always kept our business apart, and l&#39;ve always seen him as a man who deserves respect. I won&#39;t move against the Carter family because of your actions today. Still,you crossed a line. Shouldn&#39;t you be offering my wife an apology?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda&#39;s presence made Adrian think twice, and the realization hit him-she would never align herself with someone undeserving. If Verena lacked integrity,Miranda would never have called her a friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That clarity pushed Adrian to bow his head before Verena. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, I acted poorly. It was a careless mistake, and I hope you&#39;ll pardon me.&#34; No trace of forgiveness showed in Verena&#39;s eyes.After a short glance, she spoke evenly. &#34;Whatever connection you may share with Kaia, let me offer you this-be mindful of the company you keep, or you&#39;ll bring harm not only to others but to yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A slight pause followed before her smile returned.&#34;And since you were never invited tonight, Mr. Carter,I&#39;ll have to ask you to leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The whispers around the room grew louder, and embarrassment weighed heavily on Adrian. He mumbled another apology, and then walked away with his head lowered.</p>
