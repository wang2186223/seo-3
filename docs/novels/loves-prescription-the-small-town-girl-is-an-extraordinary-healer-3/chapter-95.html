                <p>Alec reacted swiftly, clutching his chest with theatrical flair. &#34;Verena, how could you see me in such a light?I am your fath...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut him short. &#34;You two have been unsettling me for quite some time. I have no interest in watching your little play. Rhonda, please show them out.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without granting them another glance, Verena turned on her heeI and made her way upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rhonda stepped forward and spoke with a touch of awkwardness. &#34;Mr. and Mrs. Willis, please leave.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The villa was Isaac&#39;s property, and Alec and Laura knew better than to stir up trouble or drag Verena down as though it were their own household.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They exchanged a fleeting look-frustration written plainly on their faces-yet, swallowing their pride, they had no choice but to retreat in defeat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The uninvited visit spoiled Verena&#39;s mood for gardening, so she drifted into the study in search of a book.As she settled into the chair, her eyes caught a black velvet gift box tucked beneath the desk.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Curiosity tugged at her; she reached for it and gently lifted the lid.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside lay a delicate women&#39;s necklace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Verena&#39;s eyes, and then softened into a smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had Isaac prepared this for her?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Was there a hidden occasion she had overlooked?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly checked her phone&#39;s calendar. Valentine&#39;s Day was far ahead, and her birthday had long since passed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to unravel the mystery, she closed the box and quietly set it back in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She resolved to wait and ask him when the time came. Yet,after that day, Verena found herself watching and waiting for lsaac to offer the gift, but time slipped by,and he never did.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her curiosity gnawed at her like a silent pest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>One evening, as she sat before the vanity, she remarked casually, &#34;Isaac, don&#39;t you think my neck looks rather bare? My outfit doesn&#39;t seem to shine as much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing her, Isaac lifted his eyes from the documents in his hands to glance at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She wore a fitted top with a V-shaped neckline, her hair swept into a bun, leaving her graceful neck exposed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shook his head, answering with calm honesty, &#34;Not at all. It looks beautiful.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused, realizing he had missed the hint, and pressed on. &#34;Don&#39;t you think a little addition would make it look even better?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac blinked,momentarily taken aback, before asking in earnest, &#34;What shouldladd?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena almost blurted out &#34;a necklace&#34; but held her tongue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At first, she had thought he was keeping a surprise from her, but now it seemed he had completely forgotten about the necklace she had discovered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She only shrugged with a light smile. &#34;Never mind. It&#39;s nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, she let her hair fall loose and rose to take a shower.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac, however, sat puzzled, murmuring under his breath, &#34;Is she upset?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He replayed her words in his mind, pondering them until the realization struck-her gentle hints were a plea for a gift.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reaching for his phone, Isaac dialed his assistant. &#34;Jacob, there&#39;s an auction at the Shoildon Art Center tomorrow, isn&#39;t there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The following morning, just before leaving for work, Isaac told Verena, &#34;I&#39;ll come home early tonight and take you out for dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;With your friends?&#34; Verena asked, assuming it was another of his social gatherings.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac shook his head, his gaze bright with anticipation. &#34;Just you and me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I see.&#34; Verena teased, tipping his chin with her finger and a playful smile, &#34;A candlelit dinner, then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A soft gleam of mischief lit up her beautiful eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s cheeks warmed, and moistening his lips, he gave a quiet</p>
                
                
                
                <p>.--</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, they arrived at a fine restaurant.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was elegant, refined, with a violinist weaving tender notes into the air.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once Verena settled into her seat, Isaac slid a black velvet box across the table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I saw this at the auction and thought it would suit you. I hope it pleases you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved into a smile-so hints did bear fruit after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when she opened the box, her expression faltered for the briefest moment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside lay not a necklace, but a silk scarf.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac noticed her hesitation and asked, his voice cautious, &#34;You don&#39;t like it,Verena?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena concealed her inner bewilderment, her lips curving into warmth. &#34;I like it very much. So long as the gift is from you,I cherish it all.&#34;</p>
