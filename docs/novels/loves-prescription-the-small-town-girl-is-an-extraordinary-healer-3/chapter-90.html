                <p>&#34;Three or four?&#34; Isaac repeated,a hint of disbelief making his voice climb.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reaction gave away just how startled he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena,quick to read between the lines, caught on to his question before he even finished asking about her dating history.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jealousy had always been Isaac&#39;s trademark.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Choosing mischief over honesty, Verena decided to play with him, curious about what emotions she might stir up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She watched as his brow knitted in disbelief, fighting back a smile while she kept the game going.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a breezy nod, she replied, &#34;That&#39;s right.&#34; She tossed in, almost carelessly, &#34;But none of them lasted long. They were just temporary flings.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac was shocked. Temporary flings! Did that mean those past relationships never mattered to her? And was he, in her eyes, just another fleeting chapter?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought left Isaac torn-on one hand, he was relieved there hadn&#39;t been real feelings before him; on the other, he wondered if she&#39;d ever allow herself to care deeply for anyone at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And given his condition, he was unlike any of her former boyfriends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He felt his eyes sting, turning his face away so she wouldn&#39;t see the emotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a few moments, neither of them spoke. Verena looked up just in time to notice him angled away, hair falling over his eyes and hiding what he felt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Knowing how possessive he could be, she could guess he was sulking.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even so, she acted as if nothing was wrong, biting her lip and leaning gently into his arms. &#34;Does it bother you that I&#39;ve dated around?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words came out fragile, as if she&#39;d just been wounded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tight line formed across Isaac&#39;s mouth as he held back whatever he wanted to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though he was the one hurting, all it took was that soft hint of pain in her voice for his heart to melt.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Something about it only drew him in closer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight, and his slightly trembling hands gave away the storm he tried to hide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He rushed to reassure her before she could misunderstand. &#34;No, that&#39;s not it. It&#39;s all about jealousy, and I&#39;m jealous because I care about you-that&#39;s all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For the first tie since his memory loss, Verena heard him put his feelings into words, jealousy and all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His love ran deeper than she&#39;d ever guessed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Warmth flooded her chest, and her lips curled up in a tender smile.&#34;I get it,&#34; she whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a quiet pause, Isaac rested his chin on her shoulder and, unable to hold back, asked in a stubborn whisper, &#34;So, none of those men ever truly mattered to you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing the caution in his voice made Verena laugh. &#34;I was only messing with you. There weren&#39;t three or four relationships at all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The admission caught Isaac off guard. He&#39;d braced himself for the worst, but as her words sank in, his tense expression softened, and relief washed over him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A quiet joy spread through him, deeper than he expected-he couldn&#39;t keep from feeling pleased inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That was when it hit Isaac just how much he wanted Verena all to himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But the happiness was short-lived.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meeting his gaze with a secretive smile, Verena continued, &#34;Actually, it was just one.&#34; She let the words hang, the look in her eyes loaded with meaning. Isaac, caught up in the revelation, missed the nuance completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Stunned, he could only process the reality-one relationship, not several. That single truth struck him harder than any number ever could.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Having one person who mattered most changed everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His mood dropped, and his reply barely carried above a whisper. &#34;Was that your first love?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let her fingers wander gently across his brow, tracing down to his temple, answering softly,&#34;You could say that.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of memory crossed her features. Teasing, she added, &#34;We never made it official, but the feelings were always there.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those words-feelings always there-stuck with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sadness clouded Isaac&#39;s eyes. Bitterness burned at the back of his throat, a tightness settling in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help but wonder: if fate had brought them together sooner, would she have ever belonged to someone else?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maybe, if they had met earlier, they would have been each other&#39;s only love.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But he knew there was no changing the past.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An ache flared in his chest, spreading like wildfire, and his limbs turned heavy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tried to play it off, muttering, &#34;Alright, I get it,&#34; before falling silent and convincing himself he&#39;d let it go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sharing abed with a woman, a light still burning, was a first for him-and surprisingly, it brought comfort.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He expected unease, but sleep came easily. For once in a long time, nightmares left him alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena woke with the sun, freshened up, and noticed Isaac stirring. She crossed the room to offer him a hand out of bed. Catching her by the wist, Isaac gently stopped her. &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself, Verena. I&#39;ll have Jacob help me instead.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t stand letting her see any sign of weakness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Typically,Jacob arrived a good thirty minutes before Isaac woke, always sanding by to help him out of bed and handle the morning routine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You might have to adjust today,&#34; Verena said with a gentle smile. &#34;Jacob&#39;s waiting downstairs. I asked him to giveus some space this morning.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A flicker of surprise crossed Isaac&#39;s face. Before he could speak, she added in a soft, reassuring tone,&#34;We&#39;re married now, Isaac. Let me take care of you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her kindness made his heart flutter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Suddenly, the shadows of her past didn&#39;t matter so much. Whatever love she&#39;d known before didn&#39;t change the fact that he was the one sharing every sunrise with her now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She helped him into his wheelchair, waited while he got ready, and then guided him toward the elevator so they could head downstairs together for breakfast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Midway through their morning, Isaac&#39;s phone started ringing-Cayden&#39;s name lit up on the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t bother stepping away and took the call with Verena nearby. &#34;Morning, Cayden. What&#39;s going on?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Cayden&#39;s enthusiasm was hard to miss. &#34;Isaac, you won&#39;t believe what I just learned. After Slater made that post, I contacted the Lyons family. Turns out, Verena really did fix Barrie&#39;s leg! Who knew she had it in her? She really did graduate from Pine Hill University after all.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Cayden let out a happy laugh. &#34;Looks like everyone who doubted your choice owes you an apology.Your wife is a real gem.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The pride in Cayden&#39;s voice was unmistakable.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac found himself grinning at the mention of &#34;wife,&#34; a new lightness filling his chest. His mood visibly brightened.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the table, Verena spread jam over her toast. Isaac couldn&#39;t stop looking at her, lost in thought until she noticed and glanced his way, confused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shot her a warm smile and answered Cayden, &#34;Told you, she never needed to pretend.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, seeing he was on a call, simply took a slow bite, her curiosity unspoken.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sensing Isaac&#39;s protectiveness, Cayden admitted, &#34;Alright, I take back what I said before. If Verena can heal Barrie&#39;s leg, she&#39;s more capable than any of us gave her credit for. Makes me hopeful about your own recovery.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s reply was soft and noncommittal.&#34;Mm.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A beat later, Cayden&#39;s excitement bubbled up again. &#34;By the way, Stevie&#39;s back from Clokron this afternoon.He wants to take us out to dinner tonight to celebrate his return. Leonardo will join us, too.&#34;</p>
