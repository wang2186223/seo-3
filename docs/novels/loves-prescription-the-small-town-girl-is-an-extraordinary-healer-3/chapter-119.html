                <p>Just then, Alec returned from the company.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching sight of Luka with Laura, he frowned and asked, &#34;What are you two doing here?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, flustered, quickly explained, &#34;Alec, Kaia is missing. It&#39;s been a week now, and she hasn&#39;t come home. I asked Luka to call her friends, hoping she might be staying with one of them, but no one has seen her. Alec, where could Kaia have gone? Do you think something has happened to her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A shadow of worry crossed Alec&#39;s eyes. It was the first time Kaia had run away, and never had she vanished for so long.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet, what weighed heavier on him than her disappearance was the Bennett family/&#39;s silence.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A week had passed since Verena and Isaac&#39;s wedding. Despite the uproar Kaia had stirred, the Bennett family had shown no reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The club was still under restrictions, but there was no hard crackdown either, leaving Alec unable to read Isaac&#39;s stance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ambiguity gnawed at him like a riddle with no answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more he thought, the more restless he became.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a deep frown, he waved his hand. &#34;She can go wherever she pleases. She stormed off in anger;if trouble finds her, she brought it on herself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that, Alec strode upstairs.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tears welled in Laura&#39;s eyes as she turned to Luka.&#34;What should we do? It seems your father has washed his hands of Kaia.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka swallowed, the last phone call echoing in his ears-someone might&#39;ve snatched Kaia. Verena&#39;s image flashed unbidden in his mind.  He gritted his teeth and patted Laura&#39;s hand gently &#34;Mom, don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll search for her tomorrow. I&#39;ll bring Kaia back,I promise.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The next morning, lsaac had already gone tothe company. Verena was taking her breakfast at the dining table.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, Rhonda came forward to announce, &#34;Mrs.Bennett, your brother is here.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena paused mid-bite. &#34;Send him in.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Moments later, Rhonda ushered Luka inside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena stayed seated, giving him a calm glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Would you like something to eat?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Facing his eldest sister, with whom he shared little closeness, Luka shifted uneasily.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He shook his head. &#34;I&#39;ve already eaten.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena only nodded, having asked out of courtesy.  She gestured at the seat across from her. &#34;Sit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka obeyed, lowering his head, nervously tugging at the edge of his shirt, yet saying nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena, unhurried, continued her meal. Only when she had nearly finished did she ask, &#34;Well then,speak. You came this early-what is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though suspicion lingered in his heart, Luka knew he had to take small steps.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Kaia has been missing for a week. We haven&#39;t found her, and Mom is so worried she can&#39;t sleep. Verena,you have wider connections. Could you heIp us look for her?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a sudden, mocking laugh.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When all was well, Luka barely gave her a glance.Now that Kaia had vanished, he had come bowing his head,asking politely for help.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What irony.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled by her scoff, Luka looked up. Verena leaned  back in her chair, arms folded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Are you sure you&#39;ve come to the right person?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her domineering stance stirred Luka&#39;s irritation.Kaia was her sister by blood, yet with Kaia missing,Verena appeared cold as stone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He frowned. &#34;What do you mean by that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena lifted a shoulder carelessly. &#34;Isn&#39;t it obvious?Whether Kaia lives or dies, what does that have to do with me? If you&#39;re here for my help, let me be plain-you&#39;ve chosen the wrong person.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka&#39;s fists clenched, his eyes full of reproach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had hoped that by softening his tone, she might show a shred of compassion. He hadn&#39;t expected such a heartless reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You really are cold. Even a stranger would show more concern for another&#39;s life than you do for your own sister...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena cut him off sharply. &#34;Shall I list what Kaia has done to me? She smeared my reputation in our circle,making me out to be worthless. She tried to ruin my wedding before all eyes, determined to crush me. Do you know what would have happened to me if the truth hadn&#39;t come to light?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luka froze, lips opening and closing without sound.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena went on, unflinching. &#34;She schemed against me, hoping I&#39;d fall. And now you ask me to look for her? She never wanted me to have peace, so why should I wish her any?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing how resolute she was, Luka tried to shield Kaia with words. &#34;Kaia only went astray, making things hard for you in a moment of confusion. But wasn&#39;t it because you gave her a hard time when you first came to Willis Villa? It was unfair to her...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clang!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena slammed her utensils onto the table, the sound jolting Luka in place.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Who made life hard for whom first? Who provoked  whom first?&#34; Her gaze was cold as ice. &#34;In front of you all, she plays the doting sister. In front of me, she goads and plots. In your eyes, Kaia is the gentle sister, and I&#39;m nothing but a stranger carrying the title of eldest. But in my eyes-before you tried to trip me at the staircase, you were my only brother. Before Kaia turned against me, she was my only sister. Now,to me, you both are nothing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words lodged in Luka&#39;s throat like a stone. He looked at her, his eyes stung by the absence of warmth in hers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Have you thought only of Kaia&#39;s unfairness? What about mine?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a bitter smile. &#34;You both grew up with every privilege-fine schools, a life cushioned in our parents&#39; love. All I had was Grandma to lean on. For a single word from Kaia, you attacked me without knowing the truth. Did you ever stop to consider my feelings? Since neither of you ever cared for mine,why should I care for yours?&#34;  Luka froze, shaken, his thoughts in turmoil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had never truly reflected on her words before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories stirred-memories of distance, of never questioning why he and Verena had remained strangers despite sharing the same blood.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yes, they had the same parents, yet their liveshad been worlds apart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He and Kaia enjoyed every luxury, while Verena had grown up in the countryside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Each time their father suggested bringing Verena and Grandma to Shoildon, their mother would grow furious, raising storms until the idea was abandoned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did Luka see the unfairness clearly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Guilt swept over him as he mnuttered, eyes clouded,&#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But apologies that come too late heal nothing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s reply was as cold as steel. &#34;I don&#39;t accept it.&#34; Luka pressed his lips tight, wanting to argue further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a long silence, he finally asked, &#34;Does Kaia&#39;s disappearance have anything to do with you?&#34;</p>
