                <p>After their shared laughter faded, Verena remarked,&#34;Once I&#39;ve taken care of things here, I&#39;ll have Tobin step forward and set the record straight. You won&#39;t have to face criticism or ridicule anymore.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A gentle warmth colored her tone, and her gaze softened with concern for him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intensity burned in Isaac&#39;s eyes as he replied, his voice unhurried, &#34;People&#39;s opinions mean nothing to me.The only thing that matters is whether you let me into your heart.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Layers of feeling resonated in his words.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their eyes met for a moment, and then Verena dropped her gaze, a smile playing on her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>···</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the Fuller family&#39;s estate, chaos ruled the living room-broken dishes and shattered cups littered every corner,sharp fragments glinting on the floor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Servants lined the walls in uneasy silence, not daring to intervene. Despair echoed through Katelyn&#39;s cries. &#34;Why? Why?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Without hesitation, she hurled another vase across the room, the porcelain exploding into shards on impact.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why must my devotion be met with cold dismissal?Why!&#34; Her hoarse voice filled the room as she grabbed another vase and dashed it to the floor in fury.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Spent from her outburst, Katelyn slumped into the sofa,energy utterly depleted.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Long minutes passed before she could collect herself,clutching desperately at what little reason she had left as she reached for her phone and called Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hatred for lsaac and Verena simmered, but Katelyn knew she had to focus on the bigger picture. If Isaac could treat her with such cruelty, she would be just as ruthless. Once, she&#39;d dreamed of healing him and building a life together. Now, with his love fixed on Verena, she&#39;d make sure to grant their wish-by ensuring Isaac never left the operating table whole.No woman would stay by a man trapped in disability forever. Isaac might rely on Verena now, but she&#39;d see to it he watched Verena&#39;s disgust and abandonment firsthand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica&#39;s voice came through the line, asking,&#34;Is that you,Katelyn?&#34; Although she tried to sound polite, Katelyn couldn&#39;t conceal the rough edge in her voice as she responded,&#34;Yes, Mrs. Bennett. It&#39;s me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That strained tone was all Danica needed to understand the extent of her tears.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Tightening her lips, Danica offered gentle advice.&#34;Katelyn, sometimes you need to let things go.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Bitterness twisted through Katelyn&#39;s mind at those words. Let go? What reason did she have to move on?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But outwardly, she kept her tone soft. &#34;I know how Isaac feels, and I don&#39;t hold it against him. My mistakes are my own. I&#39;ll make things right. Still, Mrs.Bennett, Isaac&#39;s condition can&#39;t wait, and neither can our arrangement. Please see that everything is ready for him tomorrow night.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A pause from Danica followed-a hesitation she hadn&#39;t shown earlier.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anticipating her uncertainty, Katelyn continued, &#34;No matter how he treats me, lsaac has always been the most important person in my life.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Reluctantly,Danica gave a slow nod. &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll stop by Seraphina Villas tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Late the next afternoon, Danica arrived at Seraphina Villas just as Isaac&#39;s workday neared its end. Rhonda,meanwhile,was busy with dinner preparations.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing the visitor, Rhonda was about to greet her,but before she could speak, Danica struck up conversation. &#34;Something smells amazing. What&#39;s cooking?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Chicken soup,&#34; Rhonda said with a bright smile. &#34;The ingredients are all fresh.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Scooping the soup into a bowl, Rhonda was about to serve when Danica stepped in. &#34;Let me handle that.Go on with the rest of dinner.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a small nod, Rhonda yielded. &#34;As you wish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica brought the bowl of chicken soup to the dining table but lingered there without moving for a long moment. Her fingers tightened around the bowl, and the crease in her brows revealed the weight of her unease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Memories of Katelyn&#39;s recent behavior clouded her mind. She had watched that girl grow up and knew full well Katelyn wasn&#39;t the type to swallow mistreatment quietly. After the coldness she&#39;d faced from Isaac,how could she truly wish him well? Anyone would expect anger, even a wish for revenge, not sudden forgiveness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A jolt of fear ran through Danica. Sweat broke out  along her spine as the realization hit-she could not go through with the plan. Regardless of Katelyn&#39;s assurances, risking Isaac&#39;s safety was unthinkable.</p>
