                <p>&#34;What? Isaac?&#34; Miranda&#39;s voice shot up before she quickly covered her mouth,lowering her tone. &#34;Does Isaac even know that your very first love was him?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shook her head gently. &#34;He doesn&#39;t know at all. His memory has gaps, and if I suddenly revealed the truth, it might weigh too heavily on him in his current state.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Drawing in a steady breath, she shrugged lightly. &#34;It&#39;s alright. There&#39;s no rush. After all, we&#39;re married now,and I&#39;ll help him rediscover me bit by bit.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda paused, and then nodded. With Isaac by Verena&#39;s side, there was time enough for memory to return.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;But tell me-can lsaac&#39;s condition actually be cured? It&#39;s not that I doubt you. Your skills are remarkable, but there are exceptions to every rule.What if he never recovers?&#34; Verena, sensing her friend&#39;s worry, spoke with calm assurance. &#34;Don&#39;t trouble yourself. I&#39;m confident in his case. I&#39;ve been treating him with traditional remedies and therapy-methods that restore balance from within. Once the risks are lowered, we&#39;ll move on to surgery, which will greatly raise the chances of succesS.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the mention of surgery, Miranda&#39;s mind went back to that late-night call after Shawna&#39;s passing, when Verena had confessed her right hand trembled every time she held a scalpel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had recognized then that it was more than physical-it was psychological.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking closely at her friend, Miranda asked with concern, &#34;If you&#39;re going to operate, can you even handle the scalpel now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s brows drew together faintly at the question,but she forced a small smile. &#34;I&#39;m working through it.The trembling isn&#39;t gone completely, but it eases with each attempt. By the time the surgery comes, I&#39;ll have crossed that mental barrier.&#34; Miranda knew some wounds healed only with patience and strength from within.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright then. Do what you must. I trust you.&#34; She exhaled, and then added softly, &#34;I actually came today to tell you-I&#39;m leaving tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;So soon?&#34; A hint of reluctance laced Verena&#39;s tone.&#34;Can&#39;t you stay just a few more days?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda chuckled.&#34;Oh,come on. I flew back just for your wedding. Now that it&#39;s over, mountains of work are piling up at the company.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing her friend&#39;s schedule was packed, Verena relented. &#34;Then promise me you&#39;ll take care of yourself. Don&#39;t just work endlessly-remember to rest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda, never one for long, teary farewells, slipped an arm around Verena&#39;s shoulders and teased,1&#34;A you&#39;re already missing me, aren&#39;t you? How about knock your husband unconscious and we run off together?&#34; Verena, used to her antics, played along with a grin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Don&#39;t just talk big-let&#39;s see you follow through!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>For a heartbeat, Miranda faltered, recalling Isaac&#39;s anxious expression when he came to fetch Verena on the wedding day.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If I truly ran off with you, wouldn&#39;t your husband hunt me down?&#34; Clicking her tongue,she shook her head. &#34;Forget it. I value my life far too much.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words drew a soft laugh from Verena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the laughter faded, Miranda&#39;s tone grew earnest. &#34;We walk different paths, and distance will always be between us-that&#39;s life. Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll look after myself. But as for you, don&#39;t let anyone trample on you. Hold on to that confidence you showed at the wedding. If anyone dares cross you, I&#39;m just a call away. And if Isaac ever dares to wrong you, I&#39;ll be on the next plane, ready to give him a tongue-lashing he won&#39;t forget.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She clenched her fist to punctuate her words. To Verena, Miranda was more than a friend-she was family. Her heart warmed with gratitude.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Thank you, Miranda,&#34; she said sincerely, a smnile breaking across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time slipped away quickly when shared with an old friend.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Glancing at her watch, Miranda sighed. &#34;I&#39;d better head back now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Stay for lunch at least?&#34; Verena tried to keep her longer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Miranda picked up her handbag. &#34;No, thanks.I have a video meeting to attend later.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright,&#34; Verena conceded, &#34;I won&#39;t hold you back if you&#39;re busy.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As they went downstairs, Miranda spotted Isaac in the living room. Verena&#39;s words about him being her first love and his amnesia echoed in her mind, stirring both pity and a quiet approval of him. She greeted him politely, &#34;Mr. Bennett, I won&#39;t trouble you further. Until next time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered briefly on Verena walking alongside Miranda, before he quickly looked away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He inclined his head slightly toward Miranda, his voice cool and measured. &#34;Take care, Miss Beckett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;II see her out,&#34; Verena said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac merely nodded, not meeting her eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda had come by car, so the two women chatted beside it for a few more moments.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside, Isaac wheeled himself to the window,his eyes tracing Verena&#39;s silhouette in the distance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her smile glowed like sunlight, yet his mind echoed with her earlier words. &#34;I could never forget him. I&#39;m still crazy about him, to be honest.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His chest burned; bitterness gnawed at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac had believed that man was only her past,while he was her present and future. He thought she would at least deny those feelings, especially under the roof they now shared.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But instead, she had spoken with startling candor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her openness felt like a knife twisting in his chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac stared at her bright smile, his lashes quivering,his heart&#39;ablaze with suffocating pain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena, how should I treat you?&#34; he whispered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena returned after seeing Miranda off,she found Isaac gazing blankly out the window.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac?&#34; she called softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He gave no reply.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Perplexed, she called again, &#34;Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still no answer. She stepped closer, her voice laced with concern. &#34;What are you thinking about? l&#39;ve called you several times. Didn&#39;t you hear me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He startled from his thoughts, eyes falling instinctively on her lovely face. The words slipped out before he could stop them. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep down, he wanted to know why Verena came close to him.What was it that she truly wanted?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34; Verena leaned nearer, confusion written in her eyes. &#34;You&#39;re asking what I want? Why ask something like that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When he realized he had spoken too rashly, panic flickered across his gaze. Isaac feared she would glimpse his hidden doubt and walk away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Forcing composure, he caught her hand, giving it a light squeeze as he shook his head. &#34;I only meant-tell me what you like. I&#39;m not a romantic man, but l want to give you everything I can.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Looking into his dark, unfathomable eyes, Verena broke into a smile. She leaned close to his ear,her voice soft yet teasing. &#34;Isaac, you sly man. You say you&#39;re not romantic, but everything you do tells a different story.&#34;</p>
