                <p>The moment Verena stepped out, Tobin rushed over,his words tumbling out in panic. &#34;How&#39;s my father? Is it serious? Evelyn, I&#39;m begging you-please save him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s composed demeanor seemed to settle the room as she spoke in a gentle tone. &#34;There&#39;s a post-surgery infection, but fortunately we detected it early.I&#39;ve already treated the wound, and his vitals remain stable. However, given his condition, it&#39;s unlikely he&#39;ll wake up anytime soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At those words, Tobin&#39;s chest tightened even further,and he asked with rising dread, &#34;Didn&#39;t you promise he would be awake tonight?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena gave a quiet nod. &#34;That would have been true if nothing had gone wrong. But now, with the infection,there&#39;s no certainty.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His brows knitted together, and he asked, &#34;Then how long before he opens his eyes again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a pause, Verena answered plainly. &#34;It depends entirely on his strength. It could be a couple of days,maybe three, or even a week.&#34; The weight of her words pulled Tobin&#39;s expression darker still.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she noticed the strain etched across his face,Verena held back anything else she might have said,knowing he wouldn&#39;t hear it now.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only when Maxton regained consciousness would there be an opportunity to talk about clearing the rumors.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back at the Bennett Mansion, Danica&#39;s anger simmered into despair. Her most beloved son, Isaac, had stood against her today-all because of a woman accused of betrayal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How could he turn on her when everything she had done was for his sake?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more she relived it, the less she could contain herself, until tears slipped down her cheeks in a flood of bitterness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had been staying at the Bennett Mansion ever since she delivered the story of Verena&#39;s supposed affair, lingering there to witness how events might unfold.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Danica entered the room with tear-streaked  cheeks, Katelyn&#39;s brows drew together in suspicion.She rose at once and led Danica toward the sofa with practiced care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With tissues offered in hand, Katelyn put on a mask of concern,though her tone carried intent. &#34;Mrs. Bennett,what happened? Why are you crying all of a sudden?Did Isaac say something to hurt you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Normally, Danica would have kept famnily matters hidden from her. But the weight of her sadness overwhelmed that instinct, and she needed someone willing to listen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Clutching the tissues tightly, Danica cried out, &#34;I never believed that the son I poured my heart into raising would one day stand against his family because of a woman who betrayed him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The change in Katelyn&#39;s expression was immediate,her displeasure evident. What exactly did that mean?Could Isaac truly be siding with Verena? The thought gnawed at her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Covering her resentment with practiced ease,Katelyn asked further, &#34;So Isaac doesn&#39;t accept the report from abroad?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she dabbed her tears away, Danica pressed her palm to her chest and blurted out, &#34;Not only does he dismiss that report, but he also refuses to place any  trust in me, his own mother.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>More sobs escaped her as she spoke through the tears.&#34;The video clearly shows Verena leaning into that man&#39;s arms, yet lsaac insists it&#39;s just a misunderstanding. Worst of all, he even threatened me for her sake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So consumed by grief,Danica didn&#39;t notice the shadow passing over Katelyn&#39;s face. &#34;And as for Verena, in the beginning I did look down on her because of her family. But with time, after a few encounters, I thought she seemed decent enough. I never imagined she would be so false! Isaac treats her with nothing but love and trust, so how could she repay him this way? But...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By now, Danica&#39;s sobs only grew heavier, her words carrying raw anguish. &#34;Isaac acts like Verena has bewitched him. He refuses to listen to anything I say.Since he won&#39;t take my advice, I&#39;d rather step aside.I won&#39;t involve myself in their mess anymore!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The way Danica spoke about lsaac&#39;s defense of Verena stirred jealousy inside Katelyn. Why could Verena claim the devotion she had always longed for,while she herself was ignored?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Still, Katelyn had long mastered the art of hiding her true feelings, and she smoothed them over with a mask of concern. Her hand came to rest lighntly on Danica&#39;s shoulder as she said, &#34;Mrs. Bennett, Isaac is your son. How can you simply watch while he loses his way? He&#39;s only blinded for now, confused between right and wrong, and that&#39;s why he dared to answer you so rudely. You can&#39;t just abandon him at a time like this. He needs his mother to steer him back.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica already knew this reasoning by heart,but she lacked any power to put it into practice.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Through tearful sniffs, she sobbed, &#34;What choice do l have? The moment I spoke a few words against Verena, he threatened me. Isaac is utterly consumed by her. I can&#39;t change his mind. Besides, he holds all the authority in the company-I have nothing to use against him.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her reaction didn&#39;t escape Katelyn&#39;s notice, and her eyes narrowed slightly as she understood Danica&#39;s hesitation. Danica wanted to strike at Verena, but Isaac&#39;s threats restrained her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With her lips curving faintly, Katelyn leaned closer and said with a show of earnestness, &#34;Forgive me for being blunt, Mrs. Bennett, but lsaac only clings to Verena because of what happened to his legs. His pride was shattered, and when she claimed she could cure him,he poured every ounce of hope into her. Think about it-before then, Isaac had never looked twice at any  woman.How else could he suddenly grow so attached to a wife chosen from a marriage alliance?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Danica felt as though a veil had been lifted when Katelyn laid out her reasoning. Deep down, she knew Isaac was never a man who bent easily to others,nor was he the type to depend so much on a woman.Clearly,his wounded pride and fragile state had driven him to lean on Verena, just as Katelyn described.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once this truth sank in, her bitterness melted away,leaving behind nothing but anxious concern for her son&#39;s future.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re making sense. Isaac wouldn&#39;t give his heart to someone so quickly. What ties him to Verena is probably the hope she represents.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing that Danica seemed open to her guidance,Katelyn felt a wave of satisfaction and said, &#34;That&#39;s why helping Isaac recover the full use of his legs is the only way for him to regain his confidence and eventually recognize Verena&#39;s lies.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The thought of Veena once more stirred grief and anger in Danica, and she murmured, &#34;But Verena isn&#39;t even in the country right now. Who&#39;s left to treat Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn clasped Danica&#39;s hand and smiled with deliberate calm. &#34;Mrs. Bennett, remember who l am -I&#39;m Evelyn Rowe.Let Isaac place his trust in me and allow me to perform the surgery. I can guarantee his recovery. When he stands again, grateful and full of life, that will be the chance for us to cut Verena away completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hearing Katelyn assert her identity with such confidence erased the last trace of doubt inside Danica.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of the scandal abroad tied to Verena, any trust Danica once had in her had already collapsed.Even though Verena insisted before that Katelyn had fabricated everything, Danica brushed it off as nothing more than a desperate excuse, fearing Katelyn might steal lsaac away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Once she steadied herself, Danica faltered, and then asked, &#34;Katelyn, are you truly capable of curing Isaac?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Katelyn caught the question in Danica&#39;s eyes,she realized the woman was tempted, though a trace of hesitation still lingered.</p>
