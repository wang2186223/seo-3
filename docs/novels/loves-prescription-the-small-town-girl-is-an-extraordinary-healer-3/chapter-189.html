                <p>Confusion showed on Alec&#39;s face as he raised his glass with the others for a proper toast.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The dinner was only halfway through when Sawyer Reed, one of Shoildon&#39;s most influential businessmen, walked over with a wine glass in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer greeted Alec with a broad smile. &#34;Mr. Willis,let me raise a glass to you personally.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Caught off guard, Alec glanced around, unsure if he was the intended guest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer&#39;s reputation preceded him; people at his table were usually important figures in the city.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec had tried more than once to meet with Sawyer,but nothing ever came of it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just getting an invitation to tonight&#39;s event had felt like a stroke of luck-he never expected Sawyer to  make a move himself. Maybe this was Sawyer&#39;s way of hinting at some future partnership with Willis Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Alec didn&#39;t respond right away, Sawyer grinned. &#34;What&#39;s wrong? Mr. Willis, are you not interested in sharing a toast?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Snapping back to attention, Alec realized the toast was really meant for him and quickly got to his feet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re too modest, Mr. Reed. You set the gold standard in business around here. People like me look up to you-honestly, I should be the one offering a toast.&#34; Alec jumped at the chance to compliment Sawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer just laughed, brushing off the praise with a wave. &#34;Oh, that&#39;s nothing. You deserve the spotlight tonight,Mr.Willis.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec couldn&#39;t help but wonder what had brought on this sudden friendliness.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer went on, his tone light, as if he hadn&#39;t noticed  Alec&#39;s confusion. &#34;Honestly, I have to give you credit for raising such a talented daughter. You must be proud-raising someone that capable takes a lot of work. People like me can only hope for the same.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Laura, who sat at Alec&#39;s side, couldn&#39;t hide the frown that crept across her face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Talented daughter? That didn&#39;t fit their story at all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Everyone in Shoildon knew things had fallen apart between Alec&#39;s family and their oldest daughter,Verena, and Kaia&#39;s public antics were still the talk of the city. Laura heard Sawyer&#39;s remark but couldn&#39;t tell if it was genuine praise or a backhanded dig.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec was just as lost, his gaze shifting uncertainly to Sawyer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was certain Sawyer must have heard about all of Kaia&#39;s embarrassing escapades that everyone in town had gossiped about.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So when Sawyer brought up his daughter&#39;s talent, Alec had no idea what angle he was working Was Sawyer mocking them in front of everyone?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The more Alec thought about it, the more his embarrassment simmered. Still, he bit his tongue-Sawyer was far too influential to cross.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tight, uncomfortable smile was all he could manage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Sawyer had chalked up Alec&#39;s initial hesitation to pride and let it slide.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But when Alec&#39;s face showed nothing but confusion,Sawyer was surprised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re serious, Mr. Willis? You really haven&#39;t heard?&#34;Sawyer asked, eyebrows raised.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec shook his head, frowning. &#34;What are you talking about,Mr.Reed?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Realizing both Alec and Laura were genuinely out of the loop, Sawyer spoke slowly, as if breaking big news. &#34;Your eldest, Verena, the same Verena married to Mr. Bennett, is actually Evelyn Rowe. She&#39;s the world-renowned surgeon everyone&#39;s talking about.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The revelation landed with a thud. &#34;What?&#34; Alec and Laura blurted out at the same time.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A group of businessmen at a nearby table caught the outburst and laughed. &#34;This story&#39;s been all over the news. Everyone&#39;s talking about it, here and overseas.You really didn&#39;t know?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Alec and Laura stood there, mouths open and eyes wide, too stunned to say a word.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had they just heard right?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Evelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena and Evelyn were the same person?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The daughter they&#39;d left behind at the countryside had become the famous healer the whole world admired?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This couldn&#39;t be real,could it?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nothing about it made sense. Their stunned faces said it all-they genuinely had no clue.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A businessman nearby pulled out his phone and set it down in front of them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Looks like your eldest daughter&#39;s been humble,even hiding it from her own parents,&#34; he joked.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tapped the screen and grinned. &#34;Check this out-a replay of the broadcast. Mr. Willis, watch how your daughter owned the stage. She handled questions from the press with such poise, and when she spoke to Maxton, she was both humble and sure of herself.All of us in the business world were impressed.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He moved the video ahead, making sure the moment Verena stepped onto the stage filled the screen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both Alec and Laura watched, unable to look away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The footage showed Verena entering the spotlight,all eyes fixed on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her gaze was sharp, her voice carried easily, and every answer landed with authority. Right beside her stood Maxton, Chairman of Smoothdeed Group.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Alec could hardly believe what he was seeing, his whole expression frozen in shock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Maxton was a legend-one of the business world&#39;s true heavyweights, someone Alec had only admired from afar.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He never even dreamed of meeting Maxton, let alone being linked to him in some way.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Now Maxton was shaking Verena&#39;s hand and praising her in front of the world.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Neither Alec nor Laura could tear their eyes away from the video, both transfixed by what they were seeing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The real shock hit when Verena confidently introduced herself and Maxton stepped in to address all the swirling rumors about her and Tobin.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Verena revealed she was Evelyn, and Maxton openly vouched for her brilliance as a doctor, Alec felt as if the floor had dropped out beneath him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He just stared at the phone, his mind racing with disbelief.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So Verena really was Evelyn?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Had he been blind to all of this the whole time?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eldest child, the one he&#39;d barely noticed growing up, turned out to be not only a top graduate from Pine Hill University but also the legendary healer the world knew as Evelyn.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What else had she accomplished that he had never bothered to find out?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Miranda, the CEO of AuroraNexus, a major force among the world&#39;s biggest companies, was apparently one of Verena&#39;s closest friends.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Even the powerful chairman of Smoothdeed Group seemed to admire her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A tremor ran through Alec as the weight of his mistakes caught up to him. He realized too late just  how badly he had chosen.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Deep regret filled him as he remembered leaving Verena at the countryside so many years ago.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Kaia&#39;s birth brought a windfall and rocketed the family&#39;s fortunes, making him feel like luck had finally turned.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He started treating Kaia as the family&#39;s good luck charm, slowly forgetting about the promises he&#39;d made to Verena when she was little.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But now, faced with the truth, Alec was stunned to discover that the daughter he pushed aside was the one who had gone on to achieve more than he ever dreamed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Biting back a surge of regret, Alec clenched his jaw and struggled to keep his feelings in check.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only now did he realize just how badly he&#39;d messed up his priorities.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>If he&#39;d understood what Verena was truly capable of,he never would have let her go. The weight of that mistake hit Laura just as hard.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She stood frozen, lips parted, trying to process everything.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wasn&#39;t Verena supposed to be involved with Tobin?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>How did she suddenly become the world-famous healer-the same woman who saved Maxton&#39;s life?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When did that rebellious daughter of theirs turn into someone the whole world respected?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A deep frown cut across Laura&#39;s face as a memory surfaced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She remembered the first day they had brought Verena to Shoildon, introducing her to Danica and Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Back then, Laura was convinced Verena&#39;s life in the rural backwater meant she was naive, uneducated,and inexperienced.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before the meeting, she kept telling Verena to claim she graduated from Acorith College of Medicine. But the moment Danica asked, Verena spoke up without hesitation, saying that she graduated from Pine Hill University...</p>
