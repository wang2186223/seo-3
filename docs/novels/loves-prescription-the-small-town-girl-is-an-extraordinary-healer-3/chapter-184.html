                <p>&#34;See? | told you. People rush to judge too fast, and now they&#39;re the ones who look foolish.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Unbelievable! I never guessed Verena was this capable. Looks likeI won the bet,huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Right ten, someone sent a message to challenge those who had carelessly criticized Verena without knowing the full story. &#34;So where are all the loudmouths who mocked Verena before? Funny how quiet you&#39;ve gotten now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those who had hurled insults earlier avoided the chat, unable to lift their heads, their faces burning with embarrassment.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Damn! They had been convinced she was only trying to attract attention, pretending to matter. Instead,the truth revealed she had genuine talent-and plenty of it. At his home, Bobby bounced in his seat, so thrilled he couldn&#39;t contain himself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The first thing he did was grab his phone and dial Slater, his words spilling out in excitement.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Man, did you catch that? Did you see how incredible my sister-in-law is? She&#39;s a legend!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Slater, no less fired up after watching, practically shouted, &#34;Verena is amazing! When she treated my grandpa, I already knew she was different. But finding out she&#39;s actually Evelyn? That&#39;s mind-blowing!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Puffing up with pride, Bobby cut him off, correcting like a stubborn kid, &#34;Hold on, you can&#39;t just call her Verena. She&#39;s my brother&#39;s wife. You&#39;d better start saying Mrs. Bennett.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rolling his eyes, Slater retorted, &#34;Give me a break.Our families go way back. Your brother&#39;s like my own,so why can&#39;t I call her by name?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The two of them were soon quarreling like boys in a schoolyard, neither willing to back down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across town at Bennett Group, Isaac leaned back in his office chair, eyes locked on the screen where Verena stood alone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flashes glared as she answered questions with poise,handling every reporter with ease.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her presence glowed, making her look breathtakingly composed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From his seat, Isaac&#39;s gaze lingered on the screen,his eyes carrying nothing but devotion.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He reminded himself that the remarkable woman being admired by so many was his wife-the one he cherished most.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Katelyn&#39;s fury spiked the moment she heard Maxton confirm Verena&#39;s identity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In a burst of anger, she shoved the table in front of her, sending it crashing over her phone.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The device survived, and Verena&#39;s voice along with the thunderous applause still rang from the speaker.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn lost all semblance of calm, her eyes blazing as rage overtook her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her breaths came harsh and uneven, like she was being crushed under an invisible weight,while her jawN clenched so hard it was audible.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Verena... Verena...&#34; she hissed, repeating the name as though uttering it alone could obliterate her.&#34;How is it possible? How are you Evelyn?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had always perched on her pedestal,convinced that her return from abroad would make her shine brighter than Verena, whom she dismissed as nothing more than a nobody from the rural backwater.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Because of that arrogance, she had never once treated Verena as an equal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She had believed that after coming back from abroad, Isaac would notice the sharp difference between her and Verena and eventually regret turning her down.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She returned determined to crush Verena beneath her heel.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead, she was the one humiliated, reduced to a laughingstock.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No matter how she compared herself, whether in looks or in ability, Verena surpassed her completely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s success not only overshadowed her but pushed her so far behind she couldn&#39;t even compete.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hahaha...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>From start to finish, she had been nothing more than a source of amusement in Verena&#39;s eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And to Isaac, she wasn&#39;t even worth that much.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Hot tears blurred Katelyn&#39;s vision as her fists tightened until her knuckles popped.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She cursed herself for ever dismissing Verena, for not seeing her as a threat. Had she realized sooner that Verena was Evelyn, she would have cut her down before things ever reached this point.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But realization came too late. Far too late.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Meanwhile in Clokron, the interview concluded, and Maxton appeared at Verena&#39;s door, knocking politely.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When she opened it, he spoke with rare warmth.&#34;Evelyn, I&#39;ve ordered a party in your honor tonight.Would you consider staying a little longer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though she appreciated his kindness, Verena knew she couldn&#39;t delay. Isaac was waiting, and his surgery couldn&#39;t be put off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>So she offered a gentle smile and shook her head.&#34;Mr. Fairclough, I truly appreciate it, but l&#39;ve already been gone too long. My family needs me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her firm tone told him she had made up her mind,and Maxton didn&#39;t press her further. &#34;In that case, I won&#39;t keep you. But at least allow Tobin to make the arrangements and escort you to the airport. Surely you won&#39;t refuse that?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unable to decline such consideration, Verena let out a small laugh. &#34;Alright then. Thank you, Mr.Fairclough.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;vegiven me back my life,&#34; Maxton replied,smiling as his hand brushed thoughtfully over his beard. &#34;The one who should be grateful is me. I&#39;ll let you finish packing.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Maxton finally stepped away, Verena gathered the last of her belongings and stood before the tall window,phone in hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Isaac, everything&#39;s done here. My ticket&#39;s already booked for this afternoon...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She hesitated, and then Isaac&#39;s calm, familiar tone drifted back. &#34;Tomorrow, I&#39;ll be at the airport to meet you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena&#39;s lips curved faintly as she answered, &#34;Alright. I&#39;ll see you then.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply came soft but certain. &#34;Tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No sooner had the call ended than his phone lit up again.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Assuming Verena had called back, he checked the screen, only to find Bobby&#39;s name glaring at him.A shadow flickered across his face before he answered and asked, &#34;What is it?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end, Bobby&#39;s voice nearly crackled with energy. &#34;Isaac, tell me-when&#39;s Verena coming back?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;She leaves this afternoon,&#34; Isaac said casually. &#34;Her plane will land in Shoildon tomorrow.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Tomorrow?&#34; Bobby practically shouted. &#34;That&#39;s perfect! Let&#39;s go pick her up together-she&#39;ll love the surprise!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s eyebrow lifted, his voice laced with dry amusement. &#34;And you think you count as a surprise?&#34; That barb left Bobby choking for words until he stammered, &#34;I meant the whole family should go together. That way, it really would surprise her.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The line went quiet for a breath, and then lsaac spoke again, his voice measured and unhurried.&#34;Fine.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When her call with Isaac ended, Verena stepped outside and noticed Tobin had already arranged a car to take her straight to the airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could climb in, Maxton lingered nearby with a look of obvious reluctance. If Verena weren&#39;t in a hurry to leave, he would&#39;ve summoned all his friends for a farewell party before seeing her off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not every physician could earn Maxton&#39;s admiration.In medicine, Verena wasn&#39;t just another talented doctor-she was someone others would rather befriend than risk crossing.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Anyone with sense could see that keeping her close was like holding a winning card against fate itself.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Catching the heaviness in his expression, Verena gave him a warm smile. &#34;Mr. Fairclough, please take care of yourself. I believe we&#39;ll meet another time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her words eased him a little, and he nodded. &#34;Yes.We will.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before leaving, she carefully went over Maxton&#39;s current condition with Tobin. With time pressing,she offered her final goodbyes and headed off.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By the time she reached the airport, boarding was already underway.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside the plane, Verena followed her ticket to a seat in business class-only to find it already occupied.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A young man sat slouched with his arms crossed,cap pulled low, and an eye mask covering most of his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked as though he had just drifted into sleep.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena double-checked the number on her boarding pass, and then leaned forward and tapped his shoulder politely. &#34;Excuse me. I think this is supposed to be my seat.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man let out a faint groan, clearly annoyed at being disturbed, but something about her voice cut through his irritation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He tugged off the mask and pushed the cap back,his eyes widening in surprise as he looked up.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Wait...my sweet Verena? Is that really you?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before she could gather her thoughts, Verena found herself swept into a tight embrace.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>That familiar voice and the way he called her name left no doubt who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed her finger lightly against his shoulder,creating just enough space between them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Ivan? What on earth are you doing here?&#34; Her tone carried both surprise and a faint smile.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Instead of answering, Ivan lowered his gaze to where her finger rested, his expression exaggeratedly hurt.&#34;Look at that. You&#39;ve changed. Feels like you&#39;re pushing me away.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A few nearby passengers glanced over, whispering at the unexpected scene.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan, with his mop of natural curls, smooth skin, and sharp features, wore a small blue stud in his left ear that caught the light with every tilt of his head. The whole look screamed trendy and effortless charm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Yet standing beside Verena, the contrast made it clear-her indifference was stronger than any attention his style could draw.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Unmoved by the curious stares, Verena gave him a once-over, shook her head, and murmured, &#34;You&#39;re such a drama queen.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then she added with a calm practicality,&#34;Check your boarding pass. You&#39;re probably sitting in the wrong place.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan fumbled for his pass, glanced at it, and gave a sheepish laugh. &#34;Makes sense. I&#39;m actually in the seat right behind you.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After sliding into the spot behind her, he leaned forward over the headrest, his voice brimming with curiosity. &#34;So, when did you get to Clokron? And what were you up to there?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Turning slightly toward him, Verena answered without hesitation, &#34;I&#39;ve been here for a little while.I came to treat someone.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Not letting the silence linger, she returned the question. &#34;And you? Why are you on this flight back to Shoildon?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With a sly lift of his brow, Ivan gave her a grin.&#34;That&#39;s something I&#39;ll keep to myself-for now.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She let out a soft laugh at his cryptic tone and didn&#39;t press further.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena shifted the conversation. &#34;How&#39;s your health these days? Don&#39;t keep things bottled up. If anything feels off,you need to tell me.&#34; She remembered all too well how she&#39;d pulled him back from the brink when a bullet missed his heart by barely a hair.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Though the wound had healed, lingering problems still followed him, shadows that required constant care.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At her words, Ivan gave a crooked grin, acting like a mischievous younger brother caught red-handed.&#34;Relax. I&#39;m fine. I keep my meds with me all the time,and I&#39;m not dying anytime soon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her eyes narrowed as she cut him a look. &#34;Want to try saying that again?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They might not have been related by blood, but the weight of her stare carried the same authority as an older sister.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Ivan quickly covered his mouth with his hand,feigning guilt. &#34;Alright, my mistake.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Only then did she let the matter drop.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>By midday the next day, their plane touched down at Shoildon Airport.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When they stepped through the VIP exit, Ivan wrapped her in a quick, familiar hug.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll head out first,&#34; he said with an easy smile. &#34;Once I&#39;m done with what I came here for, I&#39;lI give you a call.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena returned the gesture with a light pat on his back. &#34;Sounds good. Take care of yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment Verena stepped out of the terminal and into the arrivals hall, her striking beauty and elegant presence immediately caught Isaac&#39;s attention.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was just about to step forward when he noticed a man lingering at her side, face hidden beneath a mask and cap.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The stranger leaned in close, exchanged a few words with her, and then pulled her into a hug. She didn&#39;t resist; instead, she smiled and gave his back a natural, easy pat, as though they shared a comfortable closeness. Isaac froze, his chest tightening as one troubling thought crept in. Who exactly was this man with her?</p>
