                <p>&#34;Our company&#39;s latest project was moving forward without a hitch, until Luis suddenly barged in, waving hefty sums to tempt away several of our key people.Two project leaders were even taken. The breach-of -contract clause was supposed to hold them in place,yet Luis willingly paid the penalties and dangled irresistible salaries. Naturally, who wouldn&#39;t waver?With their departure, the entire project has now ground to a halt.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob&#39;s brows knitted tighter, frustration and disbelief churning together as he thought of those who had defected.&#34;How could they abandon ship so easily? Mr.Bennett, you&#39;ve always treated them fairly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He muttered under his breath, &#34;Luis leaves no stone unturned.When straightforward methods fail,he shifts to underhand tactics.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac listened in silence, his head inclined slightly. &#34;It&#39;s nothing but business, never personal,&#34; he replied, eyes half-closed in a detached calm. &#34;And he&#39;s made sure to act accordingly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob hesitated. Having worked by lsaac&#39;s side for  years,he knew his composure in storms of every kind.Yet even so, he hadn&#39;t expected such serenity in the face of a rival so aggressive.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac looked almost aloof, as though viewng the struggle from the stands rather than the arena.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was a state of mind that most seasoned businessmen would envy but seldom attain.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And once again, Jacob found himself admiring Isaac&#39;s poise.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sighed, torn, and asked, &#34;Mr. Bennett, what path shall we take now?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac pressed his lips together, offering no immediate answer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>What was Luis&#39; true motive in all this?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could it be Verena?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac doubted it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis had managed the Sampson family&#39;s affairs with meticulous care. He was not the sort of man to risk everything on impulse over a brief encounter with a married woman.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>They had met only twice. That was hardly enough to stir such depth of feeling -certainly not enough to justify his recent moves.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lowered his gaze, lost in thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; direct assault must be driven by something deeper.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Could he be carrying out another&#39;s orders?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And if so, who in Shoildon could wield enough influence to command Luis?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And for what cause?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac slowly raised his eyelids and instructed,&#34;Jacob,alert the HR department to launch immediate recruitment. We must fill the vacant roles before the project collapses entirely. Also, look into every person Luis has met since his arrival in Shoildon.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob straightened.&#34;Understood, Mr. Bennett. I&#39;ll see to it at once.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>With that,he turned and exited.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac laced his fingers, thumb pressing lightly against his palm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on the closed door, but his thoughts circled the unseen chessboard Luis had set. Luis was pressing him to make the first move to reach out.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac let out a quiet snort, and then pressed the desk intercom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Get in touch with the CEO of Sampson Group, Luis Sampson.Tell him the CEO of Bennett Group invites him to a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At an upscale golf course in Shoildon, Luis stood in black-and-white sportswear, a baseball cap shading his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His stance was firm as he gripped the club,swinging it in one fluid motion at the waiting ball.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The strike rang out crisp and clean.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The ball sailed high, tracing a perfect arc before rolling neatly into the hole.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>An attendant handed him a towel. Luis accepted it and dabbed casually at his face.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just then, a man in a black suit approached and reported in a low tone, &#34;Mr. Sampson, Isaac&#39;s secretary called. He invites you to a meal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; eyes revealed no surprise; his lips curved in a  faint, unhurried smile. &#34;A meal with Mr. Bennett? How could I possibly decline? Tell them I&#39;ll be along shortly.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The man inclined his head.&#34;Yes,sir.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis let his gaze stretch over the endless green ahead,a glint of anticipation flickering quietly in his eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He was genuinely curious to see what sort of ripple Isaac would reveal.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Inside a private suite of Shoildon&#39;s finest restaurant, a crystal chandelier shed dazzlinglight across the room.The table gleamed, laid with elegant tableware and unopened bottles of premium wine.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac occupied the head seat, his dark eyes still as a hidden depth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands rested easily on the arms of his wheelchair;his posture straight, exuding natural authority.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob stood to one side, glancing at his watch.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Leaning closer, he asked, &#34;Mr. Bennett, the hour has come. Shall we begin serving?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac parted his lips, but before words emerged, the  door opened softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis strolled in at a measured pace, trailed by a suited man.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He cast a brief look over the suite before fixing on Isaac.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile played on his lips.&#34;Mr. Bennett, I trust I&#39;m not late.&#34; His voice pierced the hush of the room,tinged with sincerity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis had a habit of arriving early, yet this time he arrived with perfect timing-solely to see how lsaac would react.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At his entrance, Jacob needed no further instruction.He signaled the waitstaff to bring in the dishes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his gaze slightly, eyebrows arching, and then shook his head, a subtle smile in his tone. &#34;Not at all, Mr. Sampson. You&#39;ve arrived right on time.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their mouths curved in courtesy, but their eyes betrayed no warmth.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis took the seat opposite Isaac with ease, leaning back into his chair. He crossed his long legs, folded his arms, and wore a smile that hovered between charm and mockery. &#34;Indeed. When my assistant told me you had invited me, I was flattered. I even rushed to shower and change before meeting you.&#34; His eyes locked on lsaac, hungry to catch even the faintest flicker of reaction.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s calm held firm.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His lips carried a trace of amusement,even letting slip a quiet chuckle before Luis&#39; words had settled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis raised an eyebrow, a hint of inquiry glinting in his gaze.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac reached for the crystal wine glass before him,the red within gleaming like a secret flame under the light. He swirled it lightly, watching the liquid ripple.&#34;Mr. Sampson, neither of us delights in pointless ceremony. I&#39;ve no wish to play games at this table.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis narrowed his eyes, surprised by the direct thrust.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ve heard of your recent extravagance-buying away my people. Tell me, is this your way of sounding the trumpet,declaring war on Bennett Group?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac lifted his gaze, pinning Luis with a look sharp enough to pierce.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Luis&#39; tapping fingers froze at the question. His eyes lowered, shuttering his thoughts.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The silence thickened, taut as a bowstring on the verge of release. At length, Luis laced his fingers together, resting them with practiced ease on the table. A smile curved,faint but sly. &#34;Mr. Bennett, you misjudge me. I merely spotted talents worth cultivating and offered them brighter prospects. That hardly amounts to a declaration of war.&#34;</p>
