                <p>As evening drew its curtain, a family helper arrived to prepare dinner. After the meal, she quietly tidied the kitchen and slipped away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the master bedroom stood a computer desk, a perfect spot for working before drifting into dreams.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena held two books on neurology, their spines bent and corners worn-clear footprints of constant use by their owner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Pointing toward the desk, she asked softly, &#34;Isaac, may l use your computer?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac,leaning against the headboard with a book in hand, nodded with calm ease.&#34;Suit yourself.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena answered his nod with a smile, and then seated herself at the desk, meticulously sorting out medical cases akin to lsaac&#39;s condition.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Time ticked away unhurriedly, the room hushed except for the rustle of turning pages and the steady tapping of keys.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac&#39;s book lay open on the very first page, while the sound of flipping paper came from Verena&#39;s corner.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His gaze lingered on her back, absentminded, as though his thoughts had wandered far.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The house had a proper study, yet she had chosen to remain here, in the same room with him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He sat reading at the bedside, while she worked earnestly within his sightline.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The moment carried the air of a dream-a fleeting glimpse of what ordinary couples might call daily life,something Isaac once thought beyond his reach.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And yet, by grace or chance... the quiet murmur of paper and the rhythmic clatter of keys testified that it was no mirage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A faint smile tugged at his lips, his eyes softening as they rested warmly on Verena. Just then, Verena stretched her arms overhead, stood up, and was about to turn around.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Startled, Isaac, as though caught red-handed, dropped his gaze and buried himself in the book, pretending to read.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Fresh from her plunge into intricate medical notes, Verena failed to notice Isaac&#39;s sudden shift in demeanor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rubbing her neck, she murmured, &#34;I&#39;Il go take a shower. If you&#39;re tired, go ahead and sleep.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Okay,&#34; Isaac replied quickly. Only after his word left his lips did he realize she had already stepped into the adjoining bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Take a shower...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, the steady sound of water reached him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A thought flared in Isaac&#39;s mind, and with it came a rush of heat; his ears burned crimson.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He couldn&#39;t help the imagination. Until now, no one else had ever set foot inhis private bathroom.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>And now... someone who stirred his heart had entered.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The rooms at Seraphina Villas were smaller than those at the Bennett Mansion. On this quiet night, the sound of running water seemed as though it poured right beside him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He could even picture whether Verena was rinsing shampoo or washing with body wash each time the water paused.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac swallowed, closed his eyes, drew in deep breaths, and then exhaled slowly befóre reopening them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He looked down again, only to see the corner of his book crumpled, though he couldn&#39;t recall when his hand had done it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then,without warning, the bathroom door swung open, and steam drifted out like a light veil.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena emerged, her hair already dried. Silken strands cascaded down her back, and she wore a light set of pajamas.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Carrying a fresh fragrance with her, she walked to the bed. Isaac drew in another breath, realizing only now how agreeable his own body wash smelled.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You&#39;re still awake? What&#39;s so captivating in that book?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice reeled him back from his thoughts. Isaac looked up to see Verena leaning forward to peek at his reading.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As she drew closer, he hastily smoothed out the wrinkled page with his hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her slight bend brought her long hair spilling over her shoulders, brushing against his nose, her breath warm upon his arm-sending an involuntary shiver through him. Isaac had never been this near to another woman,nor had he felt a tension that strung every nerve taut.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Abruptly, with a snap, he shut the book.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oh, nothing special-just skimming. Let&#39;s sleep,&#34; he said quickly, placing the book on the bedside table before lying flat, steadying himself with both hands.</p>
