                <p>Verena&#39;s smile faded, her tone turning firm. &#34;If she dares to confront me openly, let&#39;s see if she has the courage to claim she&#39;s Evelyn. Should she admt it,I&#39;ll tear off her mask myself. But if she hides behind vague hints, then I&#39;ll see if her real aim is me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Noticing Miranda&#39;s worry, Verena softened her tone,lips curving slightly. &#34;Relax. Other than the setbacks I&#39;ve had with Isaac, there&#39;s no one left who can rattle me.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>On the other end of the line, Miranda&#39;s brows knitted tighter, her unease far from soothed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Still,&#34; she cautioned, &#34;you need to stay on guard.Your network is strong in Clokron, but in Shoildon,you don&#39;t have the same protection.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Verena chuckled. &#34;Who says I&#39;m unprotected here?  Isn&#39;t Isaac still by my side?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As dusk settled, one of the lobby elevators chimed,drawing Katelyn&#39;s attention instantly. Her eyes lit up as soon as she saw who it was.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She quickly tucked her phone away and strode forward, her smile warm and expectant. &#34;Isaac.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Jacob was the one wheeling lsaac out of the elevator. At the sound of Isaac&#39;s name being called,he instinctively slowed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s steps quickened, her expression glowing with affection. &#34;Isaac, it&#39;s been so long.I hope you&#39;ve been keeping well.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But Isaac&#39;s gaze remained fixed ahead, his face carved from stone, not sparing her even a glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob, did I tell you to stop?&#34; Isaac&#39;s deep voice echoed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Flustered by the reprimand, Jacob understood  immediately and resumed pushing the wheelchair forward without another pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had long grown accustomed to lsaac&#39;s indifference, and his cold shoulder didn&#39;t faze her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hold on a second.&#34; She quickened her pace,stepping directly into his path.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The persistence grated on him. Isaac lifted his eyes with visible impatience, his tone sharp. &#34;Miss Fuller,what exactly do you want?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His words carried the same chill as his stare, and Katelyn&#39;s lips quivered before she forced a faint smile. &#34;Isaac, you haven&#39;t changed-you&#39;re still as heartless as ever.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A hollow laugh slipped out, her voice softening as she added, &#34;It&#39;s been years since we last saw each other.Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not the reckless woman l used to be. I won&#39;t chase you anymore. But even if we couldn&#39;t be lovers, we were still childhood friends,weren&#39;t we?&#34;  She tried to tug on the past, but lsaac&#39;s response was merciless. &#34;Are you finished?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His hands tightened on the wheelchair wheels, ready to move forward at the slightest pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Helplessness flickered across her face, yet she still lowered her voice, almost pleading. &#34;Isaac, please...don&#39;t shut me out completely.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His reply cut sharper than any blade. &#34;Katelyn Fuller.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He used her full name, his tone cold and deliberate,the weight of formality striking against her casual familiarity.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I have a wife,&#34; Isaac said flatly. &#34;And given our past,keeping you at a distance isn&#39;t cruelty-it&#39;s common sense.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sarcasm in his voice hit its mark, freezing her smile and leaving a hollow ache in her chest.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>All her life, Katelyn had grown up believing she could claim anything she desired. Isaac was the single exception. Yet rejection only made her resolve  harden-the more he resisted, the more determined she became to have him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn steadied her breathing, forcing herself into a gentler tone. &#34;I&#39;m sure your mother already told you why I came. Isaac, I&#39;m worried about your health.I&#39;ve studied cases like yours for years-let me handle your treatment,please?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her voice lifted with urgency as she continued, &#34;I swear I can get you walking again. You don&#39;t have to be afraid-I only want to heal your legs. I won&#39;t ask for anything in return, and I won&#39;t interfere in your marriage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Those promises sounded sincere, but whether she meant them was a truth only Katelyn carried.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t blink. &#34;So you sent my mother to plead for you,&#34; he said coolly. &#34;Did she forget to mention that my wife is also a doctor-and she&#39;s the one treating me?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His eyes hardened, his voice edged with ice.&#34;You claim you won&#39;t ask for anything in return. Do you  really think the moment you ask, I&#39;ll simply hand it over?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn had expected some trace of softness, a hint of courtesy for their shared past. Instead, his blunt rejection sliced through her like glass.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her chest tightened, resentment flashing in her eyes at the way he spoke of his wife. He accepted someone like Verena, yet always turned her away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn said nothing, but lsaac caught the flicker of dissatisfaction instantly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Katelyn,&#34; he said, his tone cold but deliberate, &#34;we grew up together. You know me well-but I know you better. If you wanted nothing, you wouldn&#39;t be here waiting for hours, desperate to force a chance to speak.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words cut too close to the truth, and panic flickered in her gaze before she could stop it.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac leaned forward slightly, his voice steady and merciless. &#34;Let&#39;s be clear. I love my wife. I will never  give you hope. Don&#39;t waste your time scheming to drive a wedge between us. Even if Verena walked away from me tomorrow, I still wouldn&#39;t choose you.Do you understand?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words left his mouth like a cold truth, but the weight of them carried a warning as well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Katelyn&#39;s jaw tightened, her smile stiff and brittle.&#34;Since you insist on being so blunt, then I&#39;ll stop pretending too. Fine, I still have feelings for you-that&#39;s why it kills me to see you like this. If you&#39;re so sure about your feelings, then why won&#39;t you accept my treatment? What are you afraid of?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t hesitate. &#34;&#39;It&#39;s not fear. It&#39;s refusal.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had no desire for entanglement with her, no wish to plant even the faintest shadow of insecurity in Verena&#39;s heart, and absolutely no interest in inviting misunderstandings into his marriage.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Jacob. We&#39;re leaving.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the order, Jacob pushed the wheelchair forward,  guiding Isaac past Katelyn without pause.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her hands balled into fists, fury spilling out as she shouted after him, &#34;Isaac! Are you really going to let your stubborn pride trap you in that chair for the rest of your life?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The words hit the air like a slap. Jacob&#39;s grip faltered,his body stiffening. He wanted to look at Isaac&#39;s face,but from his position behind the chair, he couldn&#39;t see the storm gathering there.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Across the lobby, both receptionists froze,exchanging wide-eyed glances. Ever since Isaac had been confined to a wheelchair, Danica had strictly forbidden anyone from uttering such words. Yet here was Katelyn, bold enough to fling them straight at him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that Jacob had stopped pushing the wheelchair, Katelyn stepped closer, her voice sharp and unrelenting. &#34;Face it, Isaac-no one but me can save your legs. You&#39;re clinging to hope in your wife,but think about it. She&#39;s just a medical student from Pine Hill University. Every doctor you&#39;ve sought  before her came from prestigious institutions, world-class specialists with reputations that eclipse hers.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She pressed harder, her tone cutting. &#34;If doctors from the top of their field couldn&#39;t cure you, what makes you think Verena possibly could?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac didn&#39;t bother addressingher long-winded claims. He latched onto the last line, pivoting his chair toward her.11SO1according to you， she can＇t一but you can?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The sudden glance from him made Katelyn&#39;s pulse race. Convinced she&#39;d finally broken through, she fought to keep the excitement off her face and nodded eagerly. &#34;Yes. I can. I&#39;m more qualified than any of those so-called specialists.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>But before her anticipation could take root, lsaac gave a low, humorless laugh. &#34;That&#39;s nothing more than your delusion.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice cut like ice. Turning away, he wheeled himself forward without another word, leaving her staring at his back as it grew smaller in the distance.</p>
